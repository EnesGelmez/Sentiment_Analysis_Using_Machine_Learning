      "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd. -- Alexander Pope==> I confess to being an idealist and a romantic. This type of film appeals to people like me... the ones who believe in love at first sight, soul mates, destiny, yada yada yada. The Charlie Kaufman penned 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is as fresh and original as some of his other screenplays (Being John Malkovich, Human Nature, Adaptation), but adds a romantic depth that makes this one of the most complete film going experiences I have ever had.There was an exchange during the film between our two leads, Joel and Clementine, played with poignancy and nuance by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, that echoed what I was feeling about the film.Clementine: This is it Joel. It's going to be gone soon.Joel: I know.Clementine: What do we do?Joel: Enjoy it.Luckily for me, I knew I was going to be able to revisit the film many times in my life. The depth of the film manifests itself in the fact that the soul mates, Joel and Clem, both know that their time is running out and that they will never be able to meet again.Most films might choose to highlight this type of heartbreak with the death of a loved one or a bittersweet farewell at a train station. But not Charlie Kaufman. He is bored by clich√©s. Rather, he chooses to dazzle us with the complexities of the human mind and all of its glorious possibilities. He is a master storyteller that is unlike any other I am aware of.Joel (Carrey) is socially inept. He has had girlfriends, but none that really meant anything. It is as if he has never had a significant relationship of any kind. But, one day, he meets Clementine. \"Don't make any jokes about my name\", she warns him. She is wild and kooky, changing her hair color from red to orange to blue to green depending on her current mood. She seems the polar opposite of Joel, but they click. They click in ways even they can't pinpoint. But from the moment they meet, they know there is something special there.However, after a silly argument breaks up their relationship, Clementine decides to visit Lacuna Inc., a company that specializes in wiping troubling memories away forever. She has decided to erase the memory of Joel. When Joel hears this from some friends, he angrily decides to do the same to Clementine, erasing her completely from his mind.The erasing process involves a mapping of the memories and an all night process of erasure that is \"technically brain damage\", according to the doctor. The bulk of the film takes place during the process, inside Joel's mind. The most recent memories are first to go and we watch as they slowly disappear into nothingness. Those recent memories are bitter as we witness the arguments and the boredom of their relationship. But as the time rewinds, the memories get better. We travel backwards and watch Joel and Clem during their best moments, loving life and loving each other. As this happens, Joel desperately regrets his decision. He wants the inevitable erasure to stop, but he is completely powerless. Soon she will be gone and he won't even remember that he forgot her. The film focuses on his attempts to foil the process and retain some of her in the recesses of his mind.'Eternal Sunshine' is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed 'Human Nature'. He has a flare that accompanies Kaufman's words with perfect symmetry. This film bounces around on its timeline almost hysterically, but the director never lets us get lost. We always feel in control of our senses and our emotions. It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same.Jim Carrey has pulled off a rather remarkable transformation that I would have deemed impossible a decade ago. He is becoming a brilliant actor with qualities that resemble Jimmy Stewart and Tom Hanks. He is a fabulous everyman who is sympathetic and knowing, interesting and kind. He deserves tremendous praise for this role. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. She is easily one of the very best actresses we have. Here she plays against type, and embodies a fascinating woman who craves attention but needs intimacy. Hers is a beautiful performance that will go overlooked. It is easy to understand why Joel falls in love with Clementine.I think fans of Charlie Kaufman will be thrilled with this brilliant entry in to his collection. I think the film will appeal to those who loved the recent masterpiece 'Lost in Translation' or Tom Tykwer's recent beauty, 'Heaven'. It is a romantic fantasy with real emotions and real characters that will resonate with the viewer who isn't entirely closed to sentiment. When Clementine whispers \"Meet me in Montauk\" into Joel's ear... it's hard to hold back a tear.This will easily be one of the best films of 2004. It is the antithesis of the typical romantic Hollywood fare. I loved every minute of its refreshing originality. The film has passion and flare and brilliant wit, all framed by an intelligent script that deals in absurdity while managing to maintain an intimate realism. These characters feel real. You root for them. You want them to meet again and give it another chance. It is a film that will only get better over time, as our memory of it waxes and wanes its way into our hearts.TC CANDLER\n",

      "\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\" - Alexander PopeMichel Gondry's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a bizarre but wonderful movie, a very strange and remarkably tender experience, which I suppose is only to be expected from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the man behind \"Being John Malkovich.\"The film was produced by Focus Features (\"Lost in Translation,\" \"21 Grams\"), a company which strives to offer original, quality films to the true cinema lovers. If the company keeps producing films this good, they may become hugely successful in the future, if not already.The previews portrayed the movie as a bouncy, cheery comedy in the vein of \"Adaptation,\" the last film written for the big screen by Charlie Kaufman, when it is really a tender movie about love and romance. This is Jim Carrey's best performance to date, and may open the eyes of his prejudiced haters who have only imagined him as Ace Ventura and a certain cable guy for his entire career. No snippy quotes, outrageous humor or bizarre antics in \"Sunshine\" -- Carrey plays a true, realistic, three-dimensional character named Joel Barrish, who plans to have memories of his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), erased by a new company called Lacuna, after he discovers that she herself has had the procedure performed only a week before. Joel meets with the company's founder, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and is informed that the procedure -- although \"technically\" brain damage -- is on par with a heavy night of drinking. \"Nothing you'll miss much,\" he is told, as he plunges into a bizarre world of long forgotten memories.The entire process of the operation is quite fascinating, really, if a bit reminiscent of an idea founded by none other than one of Kaufman's favorite writers, Philip K. Dick, who wrote the source short story for the Ah-nuld movie \"Total Recall.\" All items relating to the person you want erased from your brain are assembled together, and the technicians at Lacuna (Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) then \"map\" an outline of your memories, which are supposedly stemmed together. I have my doubts about the seriousness and remote possibility of such a procedure being performed, and the explanation is quite simply utter bull, but we don't care because the entire erasing of Joel's memories serves as a backdrop for a deeper meaning: If you could forget about past romances, would you really want to? And if so, would you be willing to sacrifice all the good ones, along with the bad ones?The conclusion that \"Sunshine\" arrives at is, to be totally truthful, as honest as can be. During the procedure, Joel's subconscious realizes that it doesn't want to let go of its memories of Clementine, and so begins a strange labyrinth of fragmented memories, constantly changing surroundings, and mental materializations of Clementine. The movie is like a very bizarre dream, when you're trying to interact with people, but they're not responding, and you shout and try to get their attention but they don't seem to notice. Joel's entire odyssey of the interior of his mind makes \"Being John Malkovich\" look normal -- but as I didn't like \"Malkovich\" very much, and thought its strangeness was unjustified, it fits perfectly in \"Sunshine\" -- there are some great special effects, such as when Joel is wandering through his own memories, drifting in and out of sleep, hearing the voices of the technicians erasing his memories and watching as objects and areas around him vanish and deconstruct. It's so bizarre but yet also so beautiful. Gondry was a former music video director (his complete works are available on DVD) and he is the perfect candidate for this project, having worked with Kaufman before on the 2001 flop \"Human Nature.\" It seems that he has finally found a unique directing style that ties in perfectly with the underlying themes of the movie.There is a very deep message in \"Sunshine,\" and it is arguably Kaufman's deepest film to date. Love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thought-provokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture. The movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to. There are many small intricacies in the film, surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings, and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent. I saw two people leave the rather empty theater during the screening I attended. It tanked in the US and I predict it will do the same in the UK, which is a shame, because this is the smartest film of 2004 and has the most to say about our lives than any other film this year. While everyone flocks to see the new Denzel Washington action movie, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is forgotten, which is quite depressing -- people would rather spend their money on forgettable entertainment than view something unique that has something important at its core.I think what the movie finally asks us after its long, emotional journey, is would we want our own memories erased? And if so, what would the consequences be? A lesser film might examine this idea poorly -- \"Sunshine\" is not. It is perfect in almost every conceivable way, and anyone who complains that it is not original must be joking -- in my entire lifetime, this is one of the most unique film experiences I have ever had.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a beautiful movie, eloquently voiced by Gondry, firmly constructed and rooted in an eerie nightmarish fantasy land where anything is possible. It's beautiful, it's bizarre, it's exceptional, it's funny, it's lovely, it's touching, it's witty, and it's one of the best movies I have ever seen.\n",

      "This movie gives us what we all secretly wish for-- a chance to forget something that's hurt us in the past. The viewer can almost live vicariously through the two dysfunctional characters that are remarkably just like ordinary people. The relationship problems are the same. The little fights and bickers are things we all can relate to. The acting was amazing- throughout the movie, I actually forgot that I was watching Mr. Ace Ventura himself. Carrey and Winslet pull off a great performance, both ditching the typecasts that they've been shackled with. Not only did the film give us the opportunity to see what it was like if painful memories were erased, but it also gave us the opportunity to see that everything deserves a second chance. The way it ends leaves the viewer to imagine how the characters' lives will end. The idealist may say that they lived happily ever after; the pessimist may say that they just reverted to disliking each other again. Either way, it leaves you to imagining your own ending; a characteristic many films leave out. Basically, this movie makes you think, \"What if...?\" It truly gives new meaning to the phrase \"You never know what you've got until it's gone.\"\n",

      "Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (\"Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it\"); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.The film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.The manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.While there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been \"Warts And All.\"\n",

      "After a lukewarm reception in 2001 with \"Human Nature\", Charlie Kaufman has teamed up with director, Michel Gondry again for this romatic fantasy. With a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldn't go wrong in terms of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply brilliant.\"Eternal Sunshine\" centres around the life of Joel (Jim Carrey) a shy, mild mannered man who is heart broken after splitting from his feisty, impulsive girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). A short while after their split, he meets her again while she is working at a library and he is stunned to discover that she doesn't recognise him. He later finds out that the reason for this is that Clementine has had her memory of Joel wiped out completely. Dr Howard Mierwick (Tom Wilkinson) has performed an operation on her brain after Clementine visited his clinic to forget Joel. Much to Joel's distress, he decides to do the same, but during his operation he revisits memories of Clementine that he struggles to let go of.If anyone was in doubt as to whether Jim Carrey can act, this is the film that will put all doubt out of the way. He performs with sensitivity and warmth, never once verging on the manic rubber faced lunacy to which he is most well known for. Out of all the perfomances where he has stepped into the dramtic role (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majestic), this has got to be his best yet. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his unpredictable, adventurous girlfriend.Kaufman's story of a man going into a surreal dream world is not too dissimilar from his earlier work, \"Being John Malkovich\". You have off the wall images such as Carrey re-enacting his 4 year old self along his journey in his head. The eccentricity of the story, which is Kaufman's trademark, once again works excellently. When watching this you generally care for Carrey and Winslet, in much the same way as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in \"Lost In Translation\". Gondry's diection gives a bittersweet flavour to the tale.The sub plots involving the supporting characters who are operating are ingenius. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he is one of the best British actors of his generation and he is backed up by great performnces from Kirsten Dunst and a post-LOTR Elijah Wood.This is a lovely film and if you like originality with a sense of fantasy with a love story, then I suggest you see it. It's one of those films you'll want to see twice.\n",

      "Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of \"little\" Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind). He understands, and perhaps likely experienced to a degree, what a relationship holds to- the truth, to understanding, and then when it ends, how out memory changes the relationship. Enter in the concept that makes 'Eternal Sunshine' something of a un-official science fiction film - the Lacuna corporation, led by Tom Wilkinson's character, can erase just one person out of your memory, all of the experiences that you and the significant other had. So, when Joel (Jim Carrey) goes in to erase his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) after finding out she did just the same, he enters into a mind-warp. He goes through memories they had, happy ones, sad ones, some that are just what makes up what you have emotionally with the one you've loved. And sometimes, and to the behest of the assistants of Lacuna (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo), Joel doesn't want them all to be erased.As I mentioned, the plot is non-linear, which could've gone the wrong way if not done with skill. With a film like 21 Grams, which has a talented director and cast, the non-linear structure isn't necessary. But it's an asset that the story doesn't start from A to Z. To assist Gondry with this, he has the extraordinary Ellen Kuras as DP and Vald√≠s √ìskarsd√≥ttir, an editor from Iceland. Their collaboration is crucial with Gondry and Kaufman (and co-writer Pierre Bismuth), as they bring all of these un-real images a real quality. Quite simply, there isn't a finer example of surrealism crossbred with realism in any other American film so far this year. The usage of lights, cuts, and with the kinds of special effects not expected (i.e. no CGI), add to the effect it has on a viewer. That the characters of Joel and Clementine are as enveloping as they are is also a credit to Kaufman.But then there's one more part that completes the success of the film - the acting. Jim Carrey, very simply, is at his very best. He finds a balance from certain scenes in being like people we see everyday, feeling low, not much of interest, inward. And then when the memory erases begin, we get to see him act funny, but not like the kind of humor he brought with Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. This is Carrey knowing this character just well enough to play off his counterpart, played by Winslet. She, meanwhile, is perhaps at her best. Her character is eccentric, funny, insightful, and wanting. She pulls it off. As do the supporting actors.There's not much more I can say about this film, except to say that even after seeing it three times, I feel like I could watch it over and over and see a new shot, a new sequence, and new set of emotions tied to things. It's one of the great romantic dramedies of the decade.\n",

      "There's only one way to describe \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\": perfect. It's been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it's deeply touching.Charlie Kaufman is incredible. How does he come up with all these original, flawless scripts? Finally there's someone who uses the possibilities of cinema to the fullest. I love the way Kaufman shows the fate of individuals and derives universally true rules from it. The content of his story is always highly philosophical without ever being smart alec.Some say \"Eternal Sunshine...\" was over-directed. I disagree. Having read the script, I know that Gondry deserves lots of credit for bringing this beautiful story to life. Sure, there are five creepy images per minute, but have you ever seen such an original, weird picture? Mind you, I'm not saying that lots of effects automatically make for a good direction, but in this case it really helped to underline the story, not distracting from it.Jim Carrey... wow! I've always liked him as the hilarious Comedian he is, but I never thought that his performances in \"The Truman Show\" and \"Man On The Moon\" were that much of a departure from his funny-man side. As Joel, however, he is a completely different person. It's like Jim Carrey had a serious twin brother. Unbelievable. I bow to this performance! Give this man more chances to show his acting abilities, I say!Finally I have to mention Beck's cover of \"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime\", which fits perfectly into the movie and won't leave my CD-Player for the next months.A movie like \"Eternal Sunshine...\" really shows how much time and money Hollywood wastes on producing crap like \"Bad Boys\" or \"The Fast & The Furious\", and its box office result demonstrates how little people care about quality in movies. Personally, I have found my first contender for best motion picture of the year. I need to see the movie again, because I have a feeling that this one gets even better with each viewing. I can't wait until it's released on DVD.I feel the need to say more, but I can't put my feelings into (English) words. All I can say is: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the most well written movie since Pulp Fiction, and the best movie since the turn of the century. It's originality is unprecedented, putting screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation) up there with the greats. And every time you watch it, you will gain a new understanding of the characters and story.Just imagine, instead of dealing with the pain and suffering of your past, you can erase people and moments from your memory, and move on with your life, without giving it another thought. Imagine your bad relationships can disappear. You bad experiences obliterated. Your bad times gone. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak makes this all possible.Meet Joel Barish (Carrey), an archetypal lost American, a passive soul wandering through his own life in a cloud of dissatisfaction. One day, his shyness and antisocial tendencies led him to meet the free spirit Clementine (Winslet), changing his life forever.They break up, and Clementine impulsively decides to \"erase\" Joel from her memory. Joel, upon hearing this, also signs up for the procedure. But midway through, he changes his mind. Then the chase begins, as Joel and Clementine try to outrun the erasers, hiding in his childhood and humiliation.Meanwhile, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo, the ones performing the procedure on Joel, have their own troubles with romance, memory erasure, and Clementine, all due to the procedure offered by Dr. Mierzwiak.Although Carrey spends most of the movie in an induced coma, his outstanding performance proves to us that his talents go far beyond his Ace Ventura days. And Winslet's spectacular performance didn't go unnoticed either, earning her another Oscar nod.To say the least, Eternal Sunshine will change your life. Kaufman shows us that you must take the good along with the bad, because if you forget, you are destined to repeat your mistakes. Joel doesn't realize he made a mistake until he gets past their bad moments, and remembers all the good times he and Clementine had together. This movie gives a new meaning to \"You never know what you've got until it's gone.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant work of originality. With all the crap Hollywood has been turning out in recent years, this will feel like a blast of fresh air. Kaufman's masterpiece is inspirational, and, unlike most Hollywood films, makes you think. It'll make you realize that at the end of the day, our memories are all we really have, and when they're gone, we're gone.\n",

      "It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love . If you haven't experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real 'love connection' per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can't be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is . utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling.The story is a twisted and complicated tale from the same man who brought movie-going audiences such award-savvy features as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Joel Barish seems like the average, normal guy who stays pretty isolated from communicating his true feelings to others and yet reveals spectacular insight only to the confines of his journal. He doesn't like going on impulses and gut feelings but rather relies more on common sense and the logical sense of self-direction. That is until he meets Clementine. They flirt with each other and eventually find themselves falling in love with one another . That is until one day Joel finds out that Clementine has undergone a radical procedure to have him erased from her memory because she was unhappy. So, in an act of self-gratification, Joel decides to undergo the procedure himself, erasing every argument, every embarrassment, every thought he has had involving Clementine. But as the procedure goes on, Joel begins to realize that beyond the quarrels and the less flattering incidents there were beautiful memories that he never wants to forget. So he does the unthinkable . Joel attempts to outrun the erasers through a dizzying chase through his mind. The story for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is hauntingly brilliant and, in some cases, personally gratifying. The concepts and the feelings expressed behind the script of this film hit so hard to home that it feels as though we our seeing our own love lives played out on screen. Granted Sunshine does tend to veer off into the ridiculously absurd but when evaluating what one takes away from this film, it is pure genius.Quite amazingly this low budgeted independent feature showcases a surprising amount of A-list talent but manages to have those performers express well beyond their famous names. Jim Carrey, who has unsuccessfully attempted to make a mark in drama with lead performances in Man on the Moon and The Majestic, gives a thoroughly convincing and commanding performance in the role of Joel Barish. And Carrey's performance is only complimented by his interaction with Kate Winslet, who acts opposite of him as Clementine. Though the two give dramatically different personas to their characters and look as if they would never be quite compatible with each other based on surface actions, which is the idea the filmmakers are trying to express. It's not what is right in front of us that should define a relationship; it is the memories themselves and the experiences of the two individuals. Elijah Wood, in his first role outside the Lord of the Rings franchise which recently wrapped up in December, gives an effective performance as a man one can't help but despise for his methods of obtaining someone's affection but at the same time feel pity for his plight, which is that he feels love eludes him. And Kirsten Dunst performs well within the film despite her appearance that protrudes a sense of innocence that feels off-base or awkward that distracts from the actions of her character. Not to say that she doesn't perform well or that the character is a pointless one, not in the least, but perhaps it is the fact that her innocence, based on her name and the characters she has played, carries a stigma with her role.Overall, Sunshine, as awkward and thoroughly confusing at it may seem and is, manages to express, in the most informal of ways, the feelings and thoughts we should all have when examining a relationship, in that it is not the superficial features but the underlining memories that make it all worth while. When a relationship hits that unfortunate moment where it all seems to be breaking down, we, as human beings, seem to instantly draw ourselves to the negative aspects of that person, as Joel did early in the procedure, in an attempt of sorts to make everything right within our mind. What Eternal Sunshine successfully expresses is that when breaking down the relationship moment by moment, more often then not the happier events outweigh the bad and that should be our determining factor to keep the relationship going. Too many moments are wasted on gut-instincts and logic, when it comes to love one must live every moment for what it is because we only have one shot in this world and we might as well make it worthwhile. What happens if that relationship doesn't work? You pick yourself up, let the relationship go, and, in time, move on. If you try your best and nothing seems to work in that relationship then perhaps it will never work and you shouldn't play out a fantasy that you know will never be. We have all experienced moments where we feel as though there is opportunity to ask someone out or express how one feels for a certain individual but have chickened out due to nerves, 'gut-instincts', or views of superficial matters. Eternal Sunshine promotes the ideology of living within the present and letting the course of the matter play out as it may. If we all relied on nerves and logic, would anyone really fall in love?\n",

      "If you can relate to the underlying theme of love longed for, love given and received, and love lost, this is a great film. If you have come to understand that acceptance can -sometimes- be a great thing and not a compromise or a 'settle for' - this is a moving film.As crazy and almost surreal as elements of this film are, it somehow remains honest and real. That seems like a contradiction... life is contradictory, isn't it?Carrey and Winslet both turn in superb performances, as do the supporting cast.  An incredible film that most of the people who 'get it' will love - but I suspect there will be more than a small percentage who won't understand it or can't relate to it and they will (understandably) dislike it.\n",

      "Very nicely crafted science fiction love story. More of an experience than a film.What? Sci Fi? Well yes. A simple science fiction device, memory erasure, is the vehicle for this beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and directed love fable. The fact that this is a good film does not disqualify it from the sci fi genre. In fact, would-be sci fi writers and film-makers should take note of this.But Eternal Sunshine is a love story first and last, in all respects. The characters are what John Irving would call \"L.A. dysfunctional\", although they don't live in L.A. Carrey and Winslet are deeply insecure people with little going for them but good looks (which they try to disguise), fairly sweet dispositions, and a desire for companionship. They meet on Valentine's Day in Montauk, where they have both seemingly traveled 'on a lark', and the entire experience of the film seems to derail from this point forward. Chronological, linear story-telling becomes impossible because the characters are having their memories erased in order to assuage the pain of their separation. No spoilers, so let me stop right there.If I have made Eternal Sunshine seem like it might be too much of a challenge or too disturbing for an evening's light entertainment, be not afraid. Certainly there are occasional disturbing elements, and the characters themselves are all neurotic enough to have walked off the street and onto the screen. But the film is so artistically rendered, and so well thought-out that what could have been a nightmare really becomes a fantastic post-modern love fable. It's also one of those great films that becomes predictable after a while, but is so delightfully portrayed and satisfying that it does not matter.The acting is exceptionally good. I would expect nothing else from this cast. Winslet is especially remarkable for her ability to play a young North East American better than most American actresses could. How this genius has been passed up in each of her 4 Oscar nominations to date is inexplicable. Carrey's talent is undeniable, though I dislike many of the films he chooses to take on. His performance here is easily as good as his award-worthy performances in the Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and Man on the Moon.We spend a lot of time inside people's heads in this film, yet the camera never becomes a member of the cast as it does in films like \"Being John Malkovich\". I can pay no higher compliment to the production team. This is a very difficult thing to accomplish, and it is done with flawless simplicity in Eternal Sunshine. This film has just joined Shakespeare in Love, Wild at Heart, and Brokeback Mountain among my favorite all-time love stories. This is the first Michel Gondry film I have seen. I am going to make sure it is not the last.\n",

      "Here's the basic plot. Clemintine and Joel have a long, rocky relationship. Clemintine decides to get Joel erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same, only while Joel is in the process of the erasing, he comes back around to the really sweet, nice memories, and realizes that he wants out of the procedure. Now here's what I thought about it. This movie is completely amazing. Totally original story and wonderful directing. Some of the best directing that i've seen in any movie. Some of the best original music too. This is in my top five favorites, and it also boosted Jim Carrey into one of my favorite actors. You know you have a good movie on your hands when the next day you're still thinking about parts of it, and you want to see those parts again. If you haven't seen this, I recommend that you check it out. It's different, in a really good way. There's not much more to tell you about it. If you want to see the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey, than you should absolutely skip this one. But if you want to see a side of him and Kate Winslet that you've never seen, or if you want to see a total original movie with wonderful cinematography and really great music, then by all means, you should absolutely see this one!\n",

      "Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Well, if you're familiar with Kaufman's work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself \"What the hell is going on?\", but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I'm glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel's head.If you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.But if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that's beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he's smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman's writing is always clever, but this time he's one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but 'Eternal Sunshine' manages to dazzle you with it's originality and it's poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.Michel Gondry's use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers. Eternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of \"Best of 2004\".\n",

      "this is my favorite movie of 2004 and definitely one of the top in my all-time favorite lists! Eternal touched a certain part of you, your heart that most shows never did. or rather could never did. it shows the fragility of a relationship. people want to erase bad memories of a failed relationship yet at the same time, cant bear to part with the good ones! how so can that be done? how can you erase bad memories and saved good ones only? Carrey and Winslet did a perfect job acting as Joel and Clementine respectively. Arguably one of their career best so far. its a pleasant surprise to see the man behind \"The Mask\" playing such a quiet and introvert role. Kate, on the other hand, brought Clementine to new heights as the bubbly and brutally honest lass who you love and hate.Eternal is a definite marvel, a feat in itself. its rich and flamboyant yet fragile. it brings the audience to such a personal level it hurts. especially when both cant seem to escape from the erasure.well-done!\n",

      "\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resigned.\" - Alexander Pope Is ignorance truly bliss? And if you could erase a person, what would the consequences be? \"Eternal Sunshine\" answers these questions, in a way that most Hollywood movies could not. Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have created one of the most original, touching, funny, and unique films of recent years. It explores the mind and the heart, deeper than other movies have dared to do.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is on the shy side. He's rather quiet and ordinary. Joel is stuck in life; he has no real relationships, a job he hates, and doesn't know where he's going or what he wants, but is too nervous to break out of his niche. Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) seems like his complete opposite. She's spontaneous, wild, and eccentric. Her hair changes from red to blue to orange to green, depending on her mood. Clementine doesn't care what people think, and is free and impulsive, doing and saying what she wants.Clementine and Joel have a wonderful relationship, then break up because of petty arguments and irritations about each other's personalities. Joel tries to talk to her, then discovers she has had her memories of him wiped, by a company named Lacuna, that specializes in removing unwanted memories. Angry and hurt, he decides to undergo the procedure himself, confident he'll never miss Clementine. As the various memories are erased, Joel sees their best and their worst moments together. They argued and fought, but they were also happy, and for a time, they really loved each other. He realizes he'd rather have the pain of their relationship than have no memory of her at all. He begins to regret his decision, and desperately tries to stop the procedure. The film focuses on Joel's attempts to hide Clementine in his mind, and his struggle to fight the process.Jim Carrey's performance is wonderful, a complete change from his usual antics. He is sympathetic and believable; the rubber face that is usually contorted in a silly grin is subtly controlled, every line and expression honest and real. He is becoming a gifted actor and hopefully the public will forget the Ace Ventura side of him. Kate Winslet, who is one of our greatest actresses, gives one of her best performances. She gives a complexity to her role, which could have easily been clich√©d and simple. She shows Clementine's want for attention, but also her incredible loneliness. Both of these characters aren't perfect; there are times when you understand why they dumped each other, and fought. But you also see why one loved the other. The supporting cast of Wilkinson, Wood, Dunst, and Ruffalo hold their own, as the eccentric team who run Lacuna, and have their own opinions about the process.People have called this an \"anti-romance\" movie, but I don't feel that. I think it is the ultimate romance movie, for it shows the complexity and pain of love. How much it hurts when it's gone, and how wonderful it feels while it's happening. \"Eternal Sunshine\" explores the mind with an intensity that is both painful and eloquent at the same time, like love itself.This film will make you reconsider your opinions about many things: life, love and memories. Gondry has brilliantly made it confusing and fast, yet clear and profound at the same time. The film is delicate and soft, but it hits you right in your heart. This is definitely a movie everyone should see. Because if they did, love would never be the same again.\n",

      "The first time I saw this movie I found it confusing, a little artsy for my taste and I didn't get it.But I didn't come in here to give it a 1 point rating or a damning review just because I didn't get it. It would be kind of stupid to pass judgement on a film that I didn't fully understand.Some years later I watched it for the second time. My ex had just left me, and I don't remember how and why I came by this movie again. But the second time I got it. And how life would be like a bleak dessert, frozen in time, in the eternal sunshine of a spotless mind.\n",

      "A story about Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), a couple of misfits that become romantically involved, lavishing in the passion of their fire. The fire soon dies and but they endure a messy break-up. Clementine has her memories of Joel erased, and in retaliation does the same to himself. As his memories of Clementine are slowly erased, he realizes how much he still loves her and tries to save his memories of her.The performances by the actors and actresses, are incredible. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet were able to play each rise and fall of emotion as their own. When an actor or actress can do that and play the emotion in their facial expression, it can make you feel exactly what their character is experiencing. Their pain and their joy,their sadness and embarrassment, and their love and their hate. I applaud to anyone who possesses this ability, and Jim Carrey does this beautifully. And Kate Winslet can portray her of the free spirit who can't be satiated, is played astoundingly.I also wonder how ethical Mary Svevo's (Kirsten Dunst) actions were, when she returned the tapes to the clients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). Did she violate Doctor-Patient confidentiality by doing that? I think, absolutely yes! I understand wanting to bring what was rightfully their's, but she doesn't know the content of those memories and the can of worms she probably opened by doing that.The start of the movie, although confusing, began to make more sense as the movie progressed . A factor that helped was the changing of Clementine's hair color. In the beginning her hair was blue, then when the first met it was green, then red, then orange. Finally, at the end of the movie, her hair is once again blue. An excellent way to bring the whole movie back full circle.The ending leaves you thinking, if this time, Joel and Clementine will stay together or will they crash and burn the same way as before? No relationship is perfect; relationships have problems, they can be messy, and they can turn sour; but when both sides commit, work together, love and support each other, you can find something magnificent. I think that it won't be perfect, they will fight, argue, and it'll need work. But when you really work at something, I mean REALLY work at it, you are left with something that you will be proud of. I personally know this to be true.Watching this movie, made me think of the people in my life that I've grown to hold so dearly. How despite whatever happens between them and you, you both still care about each other and will forgive each other for. This movie made me think, how you don't realize what you have until it's gone. How so quickly, something can take that away and you are left wondering: What happened? I always found to those who really love each other can't stay made; take me with my younger sibling. Despite us getting in an argument like siblings do, we can easily start laughing and joking not long after.Another favorite movie of mine, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I would highly recommend this movie to those wanting to watch something that stays with you, in a sense. It made me appreciate the people I have in my life and how thankful I am to have them. If I ever lost them, I'm not sure what I would do.\n",

      "This movie is a deep dark look at loss and regret, and the desire to forget forever the things that cause us deep emotional anguish. Jim and Kate play a couple that had a rough break up, despite the fact that they were deeply in love. Jim goes to a company that will come into your house, and while you sleep seek out and destroy painful memories. What makes this interesting, well there are many things that make this movie interesting, but what really stands out is the way that Jim's character struggles within himself to hold on to the memories he so wanted erased initially. This movie is a sobering look at the thing that makes us what we are, our choices and the pain or reward that they bring. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do a phenomenal job in this movie.\n",

      "There's absolutely no way I can write about this film without a spoiler, as I think, judging from the comments written up on this site, many seem to have difficulty following the plot. As a general guide, if you're having difficulty following the chronological order of the scenes, it's necessary to follow the changes in color of Clementine's (Kate Winslet) hair. It starts off green, then changes to orange and finally finishes up blue. In the film though, it starts off blue, then goes to orange (the predominant color), then green and then back to blue.I must say I watched the film with a certain level of discomfort, being constantly reminded of my own break-up. This wasn't helped by my feeling that the Joel character (Jim Carrey) was very similar to myself. The film challenged me to re-evaluate many of the memories I have which I'd purposely buried. This is the dominant theme of the film: our memories and our relationship to them.The film starts as Joel wakes up one morning feeling awful. It's Valentine's day (his comments about which remind me of things I myself have said). His day simply improves when he discovers someone's smashed in the side of his car, and by the time he gets to the train station he's in such a funk that instead of going to work he impulsively jumps on a train to Montau and later calls in sick. But there he meets someone and they click.Although we've already seen 15 minutes of the movie, it's at this point that the credits kick in and we watch Joel driving alone in anguish. It soon becomes apparent that Joel and Clementine have just split. Joel is driving home to forget about Clementine forever. He's told by his friends that Clementine's just had him permanently erased from her memory, (a new service offered by a company called Lacuna). So Joel volunteers himself. The company offers to wipe his mind in the comfort of his own home, but during the process Joel in a dreamlike state gets to visit all the recesses of his own memory. At first all we see between the couple is the senseless bickering and the ghastly fights that led up to the breakdown. But then he suddenly comes across a forgotten memory where the couple shared a single tender moment and he remembers his love for her. At this point he starts fighting to save the moment. He tries a number of different stratagems, such as trying to wake himself up, and associating her with memories from his childhood. At first he has some success, but when the \"erasure men\" hunt down even these memories he's forced to find ever more buried and ever deeper parts of his subconsciousness. But even in the parts of his memory that Joel has almost forgotten himself, the memory of Clementine is systematically rooted out and destroyed.Most poignant for me is probably the way the film portrays our desire to forget, so that we can block out the mind-numbing pain. When Joel is told to collect together all the things that may remind him of Clementine, he collects together two black bin liners full of stuff; I remember the ambivalence I felt to many of the things I myself once had (and coincidentally I also have a photograph from when my ex was about 8). Another point which touched me was the portrayal of the Eakin's (the mutual friends of Joel and Clementine who'd introduced them.) We see them arguing openly in front of their friends, slowly destroying their own marriage, which in the light of what's happened between Joel and Clementine looks like infinite folly. The film clearly shows the way in which we tend to ignore and take for granted the love we have for our partners and then how we often only realize after being rudely reminded by the pain of separation.The final scene is when both Joel and Clementine have found out that they had once been lovers. Joel is sitting at home and listening to the tape from his case file. Clementine, on hearing some of the mean things that Joel had told the \"doctors\" about her, runs away. Joel runs after her and begs her to stay. This is juxtaposed with their real first meeting where the roles were reversed and Joel was the one to chicken out. The relationship starts anew.Jim Carrey's performance was absolutely stunning. I would never have dreamed that he could play a shy, reserved and introverted man with both subtlety and compassion.\n",

      "I had no idea what Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was about until the end of March. I had heard some small rumblings about it around the Internet for a few months, and also saw a few short TV trailers for it, but that was about it. Basically, all I knew was it was another dramatic Jim Carrey film, written by the same guy who wrote two of the weirdest and somehow great films to come out in a long time, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. But does this film succeed to be just as weird yet excellent as the other two? Or is it even better? A big yes on both counts would be highly appropriate.The film's main protagonist is Joel (Jim Carrey). He was in a relationship with the very free-spirited Clementine (Kate Winslet), but slowly, they began to pull apart. So, the very impulsive Clementine decides to have a wicked new procedure done to herself in which every memory of Joel is erased from her brain. Of course, Joel fails to find out right away, and only thinks upon various attempts to try to speak to her that she is simply just completely ignoring him. That is until, he finds out about the procedure from friends who were supposed to be keeping it a secret.The company performing the procedures is called Lacuna Inc. Upon heading to Lacuna for answers, Joel finds out from the head doctor, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), that he cannot be given any whatsoever, as everything is confidential. The Doctor does however, tell Joel the details of the procedure that Clementine had. After some passing time, Joel decides to have the operation done to him, on the night before Valentine's Day. So Joel goes home that night, takes the special pills given to him and falls asleep on his bed. It is then that Mierzwiak's assistants at Lacuna enter in to perform the procedure.What follows from here, is a seamless blend of both memories of Clementine and Joel within Joel's head, and the real world where Patrick, Stan and Mary (Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst respectively) are performing the procedure on Joel, as well as doing random things around his house. Only everything doesn't go so sweet. After the procedure's initial reactions begin to set in, Joel isn't as enthusiastic as he once was about having it done. So he begins to try to fight off the erasure. This begins to complicate things for the assistants working on him and serves for the main basis of where the film goes from that point.Despite how complicated and bizarre the film may sound, it still is a great and maybe even brilliant film. All the actors shine brightly in their performances, especially Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. I don't think I've ever seen these two as good as they are in this, both within and outside Joel's head. Their chemistry and romance comes off very well on screen as well as being very believable. The writing is also just as good, if not even better. It must take quite the effort to continue to write films such as these, but the writer, Charlie Kaufman, is seemingly getting better and better with his scripts. By the same token, the scripts are getting stranger and stranger.The editing and look of the film is very well done as well. The film is quite jumpy in many instances, looping back and forth from activity in Joel's brain to the real world outside of it. The way the imagery is shown is quite stylish, and truly shows the complete agonizing nightmare Joel is going through. It is evident that a great deal of time was spent on the final product of the film both by the editors and the director, Michel Gondry. Although Gondry hasn't had a hit film as of yet, he does show off his excellent film-making skills with this film. Hopefully, this director will continue to excel with films like these and become much more mainstream as the years go on.I have nothing but praise for the film. It is definitely a must see. The complete brilliance of every aspect of the film is far superior to many of the \"hit mainstream\" films being released in theatres these days. It can even be considered as a very early candidate for the best picture of the year. If you have the chance to see it, this film is not to be missed.10/10.\n",

      "That is the question underlying this entire movie, since two-thirds of it is the process of elimination of a man's memories in order to forget the person who caused him some hurt in the recent past.This man is Joel Parish, played (or underplayed) by Jim Carrey who on a train ride to Long Island meets Clementine Krucyzinski (Kate Winslet). Both strike up an uneasy conversation: she being brash, aggressive, he being almost demure. There seems to be something there lingering between them, some connection even when they're totally different, and later we learn, when their affair ends, that she has decided to erase her memories of him and move on, which prompts Joel to do the same.Except he decides he doesn't want to at the last minute.So begins a roller-coaster ride where he tries to salvage anything he can as one by one his memories are being zapped away from him, and to see how he goes from one to the other, often with the surreal assistance of Winslet herself (as she is an integral part of his memories), we definitely get bombarded with frenetic images of Joel's mind literally coming apart at the seams, but we never forget that this is his heart that we're talking about, and in a small performance, Kirsten Dunst reveals just how heartless the procedure can be in a revelatory moment, one that makes us totally root for this odd couple right down to the last scene. One of the most original stories which hit theatres in 2004 and which deservedly won its Best Original Screenplay Oscar even if it lost in acting categories, this is the Movie of 2004.\n",

      "Though I'd heard of this movie for a very long time, I just watched it recently. And honestly, I've been asking myself ever since why I hadn't done it sooner. It's such a beautiful and remarkable romantic screenplay that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone around me.This movie is all about one thing and one thing alone: love in its purest meaning. The story has no more nor less than what any of us has been living in our couple's everyday life. Joel is an ordinary guy with a very normal (not to say boring) life, nothing had seemed to be much alive until the day he met Clementine. She, on the other hand, is an unconventional girl who changes her hair color depending on her mood at the moment. Like two opposite poles of a magnet, they fell for each other right away. And like every ordinary couple, they enjoyed their time together, they had fun together, but they also fought. As they are so different, they fought a lot. Though all those fights have never made them stop loving each other, one time, they fought so badly for some stupid reason that they decided to do something terrible that they've both regretted ever since: they went to Lacuna Inc. - a company specialized in wiping away customer's undesired memories... The erasing is an all night process of mapping and killing of the target memories. And here what's made this movie so special: almost the entire love story was told inside Joel's mind while we were walked through all the key memories of their relationship, just before every of them faded away into nothing during the erasing process.It started with the most recent ones - their biggest stupid fight and some another before it, in which Clementine and Joel looked like 2 miserable persons who don't fit together and all they've been doing is to make the other suffer. But as we traveled backward, the memories got better and better. Witnessing the very same couple in their best moment, seeing how deeply they love each other, we finally understood why they were together at the first place. And that's also the time when Joel realized how much those memories mean to him and began to regret his impulsive decision. So he hopelessly tried every single thing he could think of in order to save all the memories he had left of Clementine, but it's too late... It's thrilling watching all those desperate attempts of Joel's mind, the movie showed us how amazingly our brain functions in creating new memory by mixing existing ones. Yes, remember when Joel tried to hide Clementine in some of his childhood memories? He was creating a new memory of her! But sadly, even this new one couldn't escape the erasure. As the process went on, no matter how hard Joel tried, his memories of Clementine continued to disappear one by one, until there was nothing left of her...\"[...]\n",
      "Clementine: This is it Joel. It's going to be gone soon.Joel: I know.Clementine: What do we do?Joel: Enjoy it.\n",
      "[...]\"Facing the inevitable forgetting - the fact that they will be gone forever from each other's memory, they just enjoyed their last moment together.The reason why I've placed this movie at the number one of its genre (romance) is because what it delivered is love in its true form, no more no less. No shiny romantic scene, no \"the 2 of us against the world\" situation, no drama with a lot of tears... It's just love, in normal life, of 2 very ordinary person, but brought to us in the most fascinating way! Following the whole erasure process, then seeing them falling for each other again as 2 complete strangers, that's made me realize how strong love can be. Even though all the memories were erased, the emotions, the feelings they'd had for each other are still there, buried deep down in their heart and mind, just waiting for the day they met again to come out...And at the end, when they both learned about the truth, about all the heartbreaking things they'd done to each other:\"[...]\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman is a very talented screenwriter. Being John Malkovich introduced me to his unique mindset and Adaptation blew me away with its creativity but this film is his best.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind follows Joel, a man who decides to take a medical procedure in order to have his partner Clementine erased from his memory after he finds out she did the same.There have been some great romance films like the Before trilogy and my favourite being Her, but this film just might overtake that film to be the best romantic film ever. Never have I seen a romance as creative and thought-provoking as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Out of all the Kaufman films I've seen this is the deepest. This film raises really important questions regarding love and relationships. Is it worth it to forget previous relationships entirely just because of the bad moments? Would you want to forget all the happy memories just because things got a bit ugly later on? It's these questions and so many more philosophical ideas that Kaufman wants us to think about and it's told in such an endearing fashion.Like Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry is an extremely talented director. To be able to make this film come to life isn't easy and Gondry managed to capture the heartfelt and emotional weight of Kaufman's script beautifully. The way this film is told is very interesting. The film's narrative goes back and forth a lot and has multiple surreal moments which is what makes this romance unlike any other. The characters are extremely well realised and the performances to go along with it are excellent.Eternal Sunshine shows a side of Jim Carrey which we've never been exposed to. We've all known him for his over-the-top and comedic personality but he's never done a role as serious and restrained as Joel Barish. Carrey is absolutely superb here and makes his character as relatable, realistic and human as possible. He should have got a Best Actor nomination at least. This is his best film along with The Truman Show. Kate Winslet has never been better. Her chemistry with Carrey is believable to its core and she deserves her Best Actress nomination. The supporting cast with the likes of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson were also terrific in their roles.Much like Her, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind will have a special place in my heart. This film examines love and relationships in a beautiful and impassioned manner. Charlie Kaufman, without a doubt, deserved to win the Oscar for Best Screenplay with Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth. It's become one of my favourite films and I cannot recommend it enough.\n",

      "To truly understand and appreciate this movie, you have to first understand the quote from which the title of the film originates. The film's essence is perfectly encapsulated by one of the quotes stated during its third act: \"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\" Now before dissecting the quote, it is important to keep in mind that the film employs a circular narrative. That is, rather than providing a traditional resolution/conclusion that ties together the film's ending, it provides closure by returning to the opening material. This also ties in with the word \"eternal\" in both the film's title and the quote, being that the plot exists in a loop. In simple terms, the quote alludes to blissful ignorance. The \"blameless\" vestal referenced in the quote represents someone who is set apart from that which is blemished or tainted with pain or grief; they are innocent, free from the harsh realities of their choices. Both Joel and Clementine represent blameless vestals, as they both underwent the procedure to \"erase\" their memories of each other due to the pain caused by their relationship. Their memories being erased symbolizes a sort of cleansing, which turns them into \"blameless\" vestals. Moreover, the mind is most fulfilled in what is spotless, new, and exciting. That's why the beginning of a relationship often feels the best, as there is minimum baggage between the two partners. Each person is excited about what lies ahead in the relationship, as there only appears to be blue skies and sunshine ahead. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman then attempts to convey (which he successfully does) that eternal sunshine (eternal happiness) can only be found in those with a spotless mind (a mind free from emotional turbulence and free from feelings of unhappiness). This is depicted in the final scene of the film which shows both Joel and Clementine playing around on the beach where they first meet, accompanied by a white (spotless) backdrop. This scene does an amazing job of displaying the circular narrative I mentioned the film employs. As they run along the beach (in the final scene), the scene cuts 3 times with them starting from the same position they did before, implying that they continue to undergo the procedure over and over again. Kaufman is informing the viewers that in order to maintain or relive eternal happiness (which we all desire), one must always be of a spotless mind (something we can never achieve). By showing us the circular nature of Joel and Clementine's relationship by the film's end, Kaufman is indirectly encouraging us to either let go or continue with our relationships, which includes both pain and happiness. Through their experiences, Kaufman also informs us about the importance of acceptance. Halfway through Joel's procedure, he begs to keep a few precious memories of Clementine. He is then reminded by Dr. Howard that he cannot have them and to remember the agreement he made for all memories of her to be removed. This scene is crucial. Many of us in our relationships would love if we could erase all the negative aspects and keep all the positive and beautiful ones. Kaufman reminds us, however, that we cannot have our cake and eat it too. We have to learn to either accept all that comes with our partners/relationships or be willing to let them/it go. Therefore, we should avoid seeking eternal sunshine, as it exists solely outside of reality. Instead, we should strive to look forward to and enjoy the various seasons each of our relationships bring!\n",

      "''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' is a big and strange name, but it matches perfectly this movie. I can say this is one of my favorite films at all, and one of the things that makes it so special to me, is the fact that it can be interpreted in multiple ways. Jim Carrey finally has a serious role and Kate Winslet is great as Clementine, the very extroverted girl with the most hair varieties you can imagine. (It is different from the British girl characters she is used to play)The story is focused in the relationship of Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Joel discovered that his ex girlfriend Clementine erased him from her memories, using the procedure of Lacuna's clinic, developed by Dr. Mierzwiak. Angry with that fact, Joel decides to erase his memories with Clem as well, but during the procedure he sees that he actually loves and wants to keep his memories with her. The movie shows their new meeting without remembering each other and Joel's memories of their relationship. The End is enigmatic, but far from the clich√©.I really recommend it!aka \"O Brilho Eterno De Uma Mente Sem Lembran√ßas\" - Brazil\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is a love story about two lovers who undergo a procedure to erase each other from one another's memories, but when they meet after their memory is gone, there is something strange still drawing them together and it is also during that memory wipe that they realize how precious their relationship really was.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those films where you have to pay close attention to the scenes and dialog because even the smallest bit of dialog is important in this film. Because otherwise you will be confused in your initial viewing and will soon be asking yourself what in the world is going on. This film requires close attention in the initial viewing or multiple viewings in order to fully understand it and appreciate it for what it truly is.The film is not your basic love story, it is unique and sort of bizarre at the same time, and while it is not a suspense movie, it is filled with several shocking moments and twists, which will only increase your interest in the movie and the more you will be intrigued by it. The narrative part of the love story is also told in a reverse chronological order, which starts from the moment the lovers broke up and ends when they first met. While the present scenes are told in a normal order, the film constantantly switches back and forth between the two which may create some confusion, another one of the reasons that this film requires close attention, at first you will probably be confused about what you are seeing is the present or the past, but as the film will progress you will be able to tell them apart. The way the Narrative is similar to Mememto which also followed a reverse chronological order of storytelling. The storytelling is clever and interesting and only makes the film better and it's twists more shocking and intriguing. Acting wise, Jim Carrey is in Truman Show mode, or probably the most serious he has ever been in a film, this is probably the most serious role he has ever done, and he shines in his role as Joel Barish and is completely into his character. Kate Winslet also performs excellently well, and her character development in both the dream sequence and the present sequence is done extremely well. The supporting cast did not get that much screen time but they are performed their roles well, Kirsten Durst and Mark Ruffalo are good but the scenes between them in the apartment are kind of drawn out and I could have done without a few of them, but Elijah Wood is really great in his role as Patrick and scenes between him and Clementine are also interesting. The ending is also great because it leaves it completely up to the viewer to interpret what will happen next and the events that led up to the ending were also very interesting and intriguing. The soundtrack is also great and suits most of the scenes it is being played in, the opening and closing credits song is also fantastic and also wonderfully portrays the relationship between Clementine and Joel. The ice setting was not something i was fond of before watching the film but it is handled extremely well here, with the scene of Clementine and Joel laying on ice being one of the most touching and memorable moments of this film.Overall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is a touching, in-depth and intriguing love story with such great plot, settings, performances and memorable moments that I can watch this film over and over again and never get bored. However you may need to watch this film multiple times to fully understand it's plot and the message it is trying to convey and appreciate it for what it truly is.Rating: 9.5/10\n",

      "This was hands down the best movie of 2004. I wish it had come out later in the year so Kate Winslet would have won the Oscar she so dearly deserves. One of the reasons I loved this movie was because of the wonderful role reversal. Jim Carrey, whose comic performances have been lauded and dramatic roles almost universally reviled by critics, is superb as the normal, every-man Joel. Kate, who almost always plays the uptight proper lady, is hilarious and heartbreakingly too real as the quirky, emotionally disturbed Clementine. The words that come out of her mouth make you laugh, cry and go into shock all at the same time.The basic premise of this story is about a recently parted couple, Joel and Clementine, who were polar opposites. Joel comes to realize that in order to move on with her life, Clementine has undergone a new radical procedure that erased all memories of her relationship with him. Joel is horrified and curious at the same time and decides to seek out the doctor for his own experiment. Only once the procedure has begun, he decides (too late!) that although those memories hurt, they are his memories and he is better for having them.The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Tom Wilkinson, who has never given a bad performance, does not disappoint here as the doctor performing the memory-erasing procedures. While it would have been easy for this character to be one note, Tom breathes life and his own story line into him. Kirsten Dunst shows depth rarely seen before as Mary, a receptionist in the doctor's office. Elijah Wood is stuck in a pretty thankless role as a technician who performs the procedure. Mark Ruffalo, another technician, takes his character to another level with his relationship with Mary and proves once again that he is an amazing supporting actor.This movie is very big on psychedelic special effects, but the moral is completely real. I would recommend this to anyone in any walk of life.\n",

      "When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn't expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it! I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.I especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.I was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.I have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.Overall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox\n",

      "This film has both Jim Carrey and Kate Winsett playing roles that you are probably unaccustomed to seeing them in. Jim Carrey plays plain-vanilla introvert Joel and Winsett plays extroverted salesgirl Clementine who likes to express herself by dying her hair an odd combination of colors and dressing up potatoes like Barbie Dolls. At the time he meets Clementine, Joel is living with someone named Naomi that he mentions several times during the film in only positive terms as \"very nice\". Joel must be searching for something other than \"very nice\" since this doesn't prevent him from throwing over this woman that the audience never sees for the unpredictable unknown quantity, Clementine. However, eventually the relationship ends so badly for this mismatched couple that Clementine has all memory of their relationship erased from her mind by a company that has the technology to provide such a service.When Joel discovers what she has done he is so hurt that he wants the same thing done to him so that he can erase the pain. The process takes an entire night, and during this process Joel relives all of the moments he and Clementine had together and realizes that Clementine brought enough happiness into his life that he doesn't want her erased from his mind after all. However, he is now unconscious and unable to communicate his wishes to those handling the procedure. Thus, he tells Clementine - inside his mind - what is going on and they attempt to hide from the \"mind erasers\" in places in his memories where he would have never taken her. Specifically, he takes her to particularly humiliating points in his childhood and adolescence. It seems telling that the pair have been together for two years yet Joel has apparently never told Clementine about any of these memories, apparently having shut her out of selective portions of his life. However, these evasion tactics are no match for the mind-erasing team of Lacuna Inc., and ultimately Clementine is cleansed from Joel's mind. Just before the last memory of her is erased, she tells Joel to meet her in a particular spot that was special to both of them. The next day he awakes, is drawn to this prearranged meeting place for reasons he doesn't understand, and she is there. Neither one of them knows who the other is, but the relationship is beginning to start all over again when a disgruntled Lacuna employee gives them their files, which include tapes of what both Joel and Clementine thought of one another at the the time each requested to have the other erased. They listen to each others tapes and are both shocked and embarrassed. These are not flattering revelations, to say the least. Will they decide to part before all of these awful things start happening all over again, or will they take a chance? Watch and find out.The plot may be hard to follow as it bends back and forth through time, but it is worth it, and Jim Carrey gives the best performance he has given since \"The Truman Show\". The movie has a lot to say about how we are the product of our memories and our choices - both the bad and the good. It also illustrates how absolute power corrupts through the unconscionable actions of some of the employees of Lacuna Inc. who start out helping people and end up helping themselves. You'll find yourself catching something you missed before each time you watch it. I highly recommend this film.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an inexhaustible serum formulated by lofty doses of trepidation. The film takes a similair high-octane approach within fetching out its countless events to that of one of my all-time favorites, Requiem for a Dream, making just about every conceptual message it has in store function freakishly well. Charlie Kaufman's script is the key module to this movie's heart-rending brain cluster that is surely guaranteed to tumble over and cause any other romantic narrative to look puny in comparison.

      "Now... those of you who haven't seen this, would probably go in to this movie with extremely high standards, and I don't blame you. This movie has seriously been recommended, and welcomed by critics. After seeing it for the first time, I understand why.Charlie Kauffman is known for his \"Out-Of-The-Ordinary\" scripts, and this is no exception. However Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind has something a little extra, something special, and as soon as it starts, you'll know it. What's amazing is that he captures what every true love story has, into one relationship... that of Joel and Clementine's. The idea of having one person in the world for everyone is supported.The acting is superb, both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do an excellent job of pulling their weight. They are able to truly become their characters... who in reality, are complete opposites of the two in real life. Jim usually plays the overtly open character, bad mouthing everyone he's p***ed of at. Kate, usually playing the more \"innocent-type\" characters, damsels in distress, things like that. The two deliver, and I couldn't have imagined anyone else in the roles of Clementine and Joel. I truly believe there are Oscar noms. hiding in this movie for the two leads.The plot of this movie is very unique, very different. Now although going to get parts of your memory erased may seem corny at first, it truly shows the fact that are brains are misunderstood parts of our body, and no matter how hard we try to forget something, it will always find it's way back to us.The ending makes perfect sense, and while being tastefully done, it doesn't ruin the movie in any shape or form. While it is not one of those completely open-ended endings, some things are still left out in the air, to think about ourselves, and those are always more fun.Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, is one of those things that if you never take the time to sit down and watch this remarkable film, you'll end up regretting it for the rest of your life. And after you finally do watch it, I honestly think, you wouldn't want to erase the memory of this movie, even if you had the chance.\"How Happy Is The Blameless Vestal's Lot, The World Forgetting, By The World Forgot.

      "A very insightful story about relationships. Are they really that hard? The answer is: Yes, that's what relationships are like. You do remember how you met and why you fell in love. All the happy memories are there. But then, there is also all that other stuff. The things you start to hate about each other. The unrepairable mistakes you made. The regrets. And at some times they end up on top, covering up the foundation of good things, the common ground, the reason why you started to build up the relationship together.\n",
      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" has an absolutely fascinating way of depicting that mechanism. Funnily, it starts with a Valentine's Day reference in the opening scene. That is to say: This movie is going to be in strong contrast with the banality of Valentine's Day greeting cards. Valentine's Day celebrates naive, young love, love that is confident because it is oblivious. In the climax scene the movie contrasts the protagonists' (and our own) wish for a happy end with the tape recordings of both ex lovers spelling out each other's most repelling qualities and the reasons why they crave for the relationship to be wiped off their memories. The movie is about love an still is the contrary of Valentine's Day banality: It celebrates love, conscious and aware of the problems and backdrops. It admits: Maybe you get through it together, maybe you don't.Worth mentioning besides that: The thrilling performances by the main actors (Winslet, Carrey) and the supporting actors (Dunst, Ruffalo, Wilkinson, Wood), the constant suspense that had me on the edge of my chair regardless of the film's overall rather slow 'pace'; a very well-contrived \"Memento\"-like time structure, and the unostentatious visual effects that are a vital part of the storytelling but don't steel the show.In sum, one of the best movies I know.\n",

      "I often find myself knowingly going back to toxic relationships regardless of it being romantic, etc. After a high, a low may follow and it absolutely crushes me to know that I will go back to them regardless. Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like to leave them completely. But that only lasts a second and I know that I am going back to them because when it is good, it is extremely good I want nothing else until the day I die than to spend time with them.This reminds me of the girl I used to like; the day I met her ex, I realised I did not even deserve to like this girl anymore. I saw how much they were missing each other, yet not making a single move because they knew they would be toxic to each other. Knowing that, I knew that I could never make this girl happy the way her ex did. Good times are good, it's just that it sucks they are followed by some awful times at times.Love is such a weird feeling, though I doubt that I have ever experienced it. All I know for now is that once you earn it, it should not be easy for it to be taken away from you. It would also be very lucky of me to have experienced it in my life time.\n",

      "This movie left me unnerved with all the emotions it threw at me. I can't say I've seen a romance movie anything like it but my heart was torn at by Joel and Clementines relationship. So often we desperately grasp for the love we've felt in the past and I've never seen that feeling so honestly depicted in a film. It's heartbreaking to see Joel have his world, a world of the past, ripped away from him. All the memories first bitter than pleasant have had a profound effect, yet in a rash decision such a substantial part of life can be taken away. What is truly profound about this film is how impactful our partners can be whether or not things work out for the better. The film's ending really makes you think about whether or not our relationships would work if given a second chance. There's no way to know, but there's something beautiful about the journey in Joel's mind through his relationship. We forget how often take for granted the memories we've had with our past lovers. Rarely does a film depict romance in a unique and personal way which stings even after you view it. Don't watch this film unless you're ready for an emotional burden, but if romance is something you value, this might resonate in a way which truly feel like a painful yet profound punch in the gut...\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) does not start to define this script complicated. One morning shy Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) chooses not to go to job but to hop on a train to Montauk, a seaside retreat on Long Island's eastern tip, where he is walking along the beach.He meets extroverted Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on the manner home, who picks him up more or less on the train and starts a friendship. Then she decides that she doesn't want to go on so she goes to a kind of clinic run by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), where the brain of a person can be erased from particular memories, to erase Joel.Joel learns about this and is going to the clinic.He's so angry that he's applying for Clementine to erase his brain. The concept is that he takes all the stuff he has to do with her and then they come to his apartment, placed over his head a large electronic thing attached to a laptop, and he goes to sleep as they remove from his brain overnight everything to do with her.She shouldn't even be a memory when he wakes up in the morning. But he changes his mind during the night, while he's asleep. It gets complicated here. It gets complex here. Not only are the engineers performing the purge, Mary (Kirsten Dunst), Stan (Mark Ruffalo), and Patrick (Elijah Wood), distracted by romance as we travel through Joel's brain, we discover ourselves engaged in time warps and other mental shenanigans as Joel fights the process while he sleeps. It's technology love; who's going to conquer?Besides things that aren't what they look like, relationships aren't the way we think. It doesn't seem that even the opening sequence was what we believed it was.

      "\"Eternal Sunshine\" is one of the most creative and unique films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.The underlying theme of the story revolves around abstract concepts, such as memory and fate, and is thus difficult to capture. The idea is twofold: that without memories of our past experiences, we are destined to repeat the same mistakes in the future. However, continuing to attach negative emotions to those experiences can rob us of finding new joy.The erasing procedure, according to the doctor, targets emotional areas of the brain. Despite the perception of the true effects, the memories are not erased entirely...only the emotion, which is the most important part. This explains why even after Joel and Clementine's individual procedures, fragments of the other still remain, allowing them to meet again and experience their love for each other anew.Anytime a subject such as human consciousness is tackled, it is not going to be easy to depict coherently. But somehow it works here...and brilliantly.Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is phenomenal and is influenced by his real life experiences. He chooses to portray love as anything but a walk in the park (as he felt most hollywood romances were). The relationship between Joel and Clementine is intensely authentic and relatable to anyone who has experienced the messiness of intimate relationship (romantic or not). The good times are shown as well as the bad, and neither of them are required to earn the others love. Ultimately, it is their mistakes that continuously bring them back together. One of Clementine's final lines is fitting: \"I'm not perfect.\" And if the love is real, she shouldn't have to be. This lets us plant ourselves firmly in the characters' shoes to empathize with at least part of what they are experiencing.The film is edited perfectly in a way that leaves the audience wrestling with what the true nature of memory is and how that affects them. By showing us the relationship in reverse chronological order and bookending with a new beginning, we are elated and heartbroken at the same time. Along with the couple, we too get to witness the nostalgia of their best times together. And yet, while this is fresh in our mind, we know how the story will end again and the cycle will keep repeating because they are physically unable to learn from their mistakes.So is holding on to memory good or bad?I think the answer is both. There is a balance in remembering mistakes from the past to prevent repeating them, while at the same time keeping the mind selectively \"spotless\" to preserve novelty and experience life in the fullness of the present moment.While we don't get to see our beloved characters find this balance, it is a lesson that we can learn from and apply to our own life experiences.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a profound work of art. It is wildly creative and technically impressive, and at the end of the day comes together to effectively inspire deep introspection of complex facets of life.\n",

I am surprised at how great critiques this movie has had. I watched it only because I saw it in a Top.40 movie list on the internet, aside from that, I never heard about this movie in my life. Not everything was that bad, I will say, it had short good moments but in general, the movie intended to innovate a way of telling a story, but it was just an experiment, nothing more.

      "Everything other than Jim Carrey's performance is nonsense in this movie. I got sick of repetetive scenes and overacting including Kate Winslet. What is that neverending partying scene in Joel's bedroom? Are we supposed to laugh at that? What about Joel's interaction with the memories of Clementine and taking advices from them? Nonsense over nonsense... The movie could have been much better, had the screenwriter made a better research about the unconscious mind and the director introduced less agitation. All of 6 points are for Jim Carrey.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an eccentric love story between two different people who initially have a great relationship but it goes sour when realizing their extremely opposite personalities. They try to erase each other from their memories, but in doing so, realize what they had and how important it is to keep those special moments. This film shows how love makes us do silly things and how powerful it can be when two people share that affection. The film takes place during the winter in New York, where the cold weather can either make you feel like searching for warmth in someone's arms or it can make you feel lonely. Jim Carrey as Joel does an amazing job at interpreting a timid and introvert character while Kate Winslet, as Clementine, plays a spontaneous and energetic woman whose personality can go to either extreme in less than a second. The choice of slow and melancholy music helps portray these emotions throughout the movie as it takes us through the different memories they once shared. Most of the movie consists of several soliloquies where Jim Carrey, or Joel, exposes his inner most thoughts about a certain someone or something but does the opposite when Clementine is around. The dialog shared between the two also molds their characters and shows how distinct they are, and how their opposite personalities are what attract them.\n",

      "ETERNAL SUNSHINE's narrative is essentially a love story told backwards. It deals with the traditional problem of reverse narrative in a new way. The traditional problem is that if the audience already knows the ending (bitter breakup), then telling the story in reverse asks the audience the question of \"is it worth it?\" as we watch the story back to the beginning (falling in love). This intellectualizes the experience rather than giving us dramatic action. ETERNAL SUNSHINE deals with this problem of intellectualization by giving the protagonist an active role in the reverse narrative. Joel is able to interact with his old memories to try to stop the process of erasing; this attempt to escape is the major sub- plot of the film. The catharsis of the audience comes with his rediscovery of his love for Clementine as they try to escape together. They fail to escape at the climax of this sub-plot and his memory is erased. But the lovers meet again by fate and once again fall in love. This fake climax of the main love-story plot is placed at the beginning of the film and again at the end of the film ‚Äì the audience realizes the despite losing all their memory, the lovers meet and fall in love again. If the film ended there, it would have been a good film, and the central idea would have been \"Love happens because of fate\". But the problem would have been that Joel went through this huge journey of discovery and change but that all seems to go to waste if fate was just going to put them together again ‚Äì he needs to be the one making an active choice that demonstrates his internal change at climax. The real climax of ETERNAL SUNSHINE comes out of the reversal at the end, in which the Joel and Clementine discover their bitter past and must choose whether or not to commit despite their past. This resurfaces Joel's inner journey. He and she choose to commit, completing Joel's journey of internal change with an external action. The central idea now becomes \"Love happens because of fate but it will only result in a happy relationship with open acceptance of each other and the painful compromises that come with love\". This real climax fueled by true character change, dilemma and choice is what makes the film great. The climax completes the audience catharsis experienced through Joel's rediscovery of love; as a result he wins the girl and we are touched by a great story.My Story Chart of this movie is at storycharts.ca\n",

      "On a Valentine Day, Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) feels the impulse of going to Montauk instead of working. After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is another intriguing and original screenplay written by Charlie Kaufman, certainly one of the most intelligent writers in the contemporary Hollywood. With the exception of the boring \"Human Nature\", all his other recent screenplays (\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", \"Adaptation\" and \"Being John Malkovich\") are at least very originals. The love story of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is fascinating and the cast is stunning. The underrated Jim Carrey and the magnificent Kate Winslet give other awesome performances, showing a great chemistry in their leading roles. The supporting cast, with the names of Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson and Mark Ruffalo is superb, and it is really worthwhile watching this great film. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Brilho Eterno de Uma Mente Sem Lembran√ßas\" (\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\")\n",

      "Yea it's more fantasy than sci-fi because it's about memories, and dreaming within them. It's unrealistic to be dreaming consciously within a memory. That's fantasy.

      "This is the filmic equivalent of being stuck in a room with someone who thinks they have the most emotionally upsetting life imaginable and is doing everything in their power to persuade you they are truly tortured and pitiable. By the end of both experiences you just want to go home and feel utterly relieved you aren't so arrogant. Or you wish you were able to erase your own memory. (Sorry, a cheap film tie-in metaphor already.)The film itself, like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation suffers from a hole in the centre. Charlie Kauffman seems to think it is clever to take a totally unlikely scenario and then develop it into a \"quirky\" film that is supposed to make little sense. In each instance he fails to grasp that you can't just take a scenario so utterly implausible as to defy any audience to relate or respond to it. Eternal Sunshine is a slightly easier premise to connect with than Being John Malkovich, after all who hasn't wondered what it would be like to erase painful relationships. However Kauffman sems to mistake nonsense for emotional and intellectual depth.Someone told me that you have to watch Eternal Sunshine more than once to 'get it' and I promise that this isn't true. There is nothing you get the second time that you won't have got the first time. It is a fairly straight forward film. The only problem you might have is if you are colour blind and can't work out the time scale of the film from Kate Winslett's hair because you cannot tell that it is changing colour. The director might as well have put subtitles across the bottom of the screen saying \"Two years ago\" \"Present day\" because Gondry's visual 'clues' were about as subtle or 'clue-like' as subtitles.Performance wise, Kate Winslett was her usual self, and Jim Carrey was in Truman show mode. Carrey offers ocassional glimpses of acting talent before they are devoured by his all consuming gurning. Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst offer more respectable performances, however I felt cheated that their entire sub plot was clearly lying on the editing room floor, it felt rushed and unconvincing. Which is a shame because the rest of the film felt over long and over laboured and perhaps a better balance might have saved my cinema ticket which I spent the whole film folding into a variety of shapes.\n",
      "I made a square (Not too difficult) a triangle. I tried to make a swan but it ended up looking like some sort of half eaten fish. After that I was running out of ideas and so i tore it into equal pieces. Then unequal ones. Bored yet? I was. The second time I saw it was even worse. Fortunately I had just seen 3-4x Jugatsu and so had something to concentrate on. Namely trying to understand a film which actually had some sort of emotional depth, some sort of conflicting plot and some semblance of lead performances.\n",
      "I wish people wouldn't think that any film which doesn't have a discernable Beginning - middle - end structure automatically qualifies as intelligent or engaging. And that just because Jim Carrey isn't smacking himself in the face or making chimp noises he is acting. He isn't. He is just biding his time until he can start hitting himself in the face again.\n",

      "Despite my desire to enjoy what I hoped would be a unique film, I found it dark and self indulgent.  The superb acting couldn't overcome a script that is centered on a failed relationship that never makes sense to the viewer or to the lovers.  In the end you feel like this is \"Adaptation II\" - yet another film about a brooding self-centered guy who can't really relate to anyone beyond his own fantasy life.  The dramatic device ultimately used in the film of having the main character fight to preserve his memory fails because it comes across as a clever but unsatisfying rendition of psychotherapy.  The subplot is banal and adolescent.  In many ways this entire film comes across as something that was done back in the 60's, but which now falls flat.\n",

      "I think it goes without saying amongst fellow film aficionados, that we all love films, especially the great ones. However over the years watching films I've noticed there seems to be that one film that is hugely popular, but when you sit down to watch it, you can't understand why it's held in such high regard. For me it's only happened a couple of times, but I unfortunately have to add Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to the list.Whilst I appreciated the original screenplay from Charlie Kaufman(whose work I usually love), it felt completely flat. I was never engaged at any moment in the film, the characters were extremely unlikable and had horrible personalities. Other then one emotional scene towards the end with Kirsten Dunst's character, the film felt dull and lifeless. At no point did I feel invested in the story. I was unable to buy into Joel(Jim Carrey) and Clementine's(Kate Winslet) impromptu relationship, which dissolved just as quickly as it began, giving me no time with their characters to care about their eventual fate.Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give excellent performances, as do the entire cast. I just disliked their characters. The technical aspects of the film were well done. The way the film showcases memories, and the way they subsequently disappeared/folded into each other was expertly crafted and brilliantly edited. The only issue is the story and the characters didn't work for me. No matter how good the direction and editing is, the majority of the the time a film lives or dies by the strength of it's story and it's characters, and here it ultimately failed.\n",

      "POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADI was expecting a great movie when I take it. But after 30 minutes watching it I realized that it would be a waste of time.The idea is interesting, explore the possibility of erasing someone from you mind gives you a wide range of paths to follow to create interest, climax, and sympathy to the main characters. This is not what happens in this movie. The plot is weak, the entire movie is spent to show how he tries to hide his girlfriend in his memory in a very boring way. The memories were not fun, not interesting, and added nothing to the history.They could have made a much better movie if the history was a comedy, but unfortunately they have chosen a \"drama\" (supposing it can be classified like this) which makes the watcher expects for its end. Even those romantic comedies are better than this because at least you want the couple to end the history together.\n",

      "(Spoiled...) Like the rest of Kaufman's self-absorbed hallucinations, Eternal Sunshine fails to jump the \"who cares\" hurdle. What an overwrought mess of a movie. As far as that mind-surgery-memory-deleting helmet goes, why in tarnation was Jim Carrey's character--a self-described uninteresting bore--so very talented at resisting the program? No mental giant, he would have succumbed immediately. End of movie. But no! We replay this deja vu game of meeting forgotten lovers into infinity, while every character gets thrown into stylistic outer space: Comedy for some, tragedy for others, sex farce when Mr. Kaufman runs out of ideas. Actually, apart from Sunshine's tangled structure, there are no ideas. Not once are we given useful, relevant information about anyone who inhabits the film. Carrey and Winslet's megawatt dual-presence is wasted inside of a situation that resembles a hamster cage, not a story. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the memory-deleting helmet inventor, seems to grasp the danger of what's happening. Kaufman, however, surrounds him with a gang of assistants who are giggling morons. What a sad, confused, irrelevant film. I was reminded more than once of the forgotten French mind-game films of the sixties. Marienbad, anyone?\n",

So why am I scratching my head after watching this and seeing over 49% of 12,000 voters giving this a 10? I just don't get it.To be honest, I found the movie pretty average. It has some great acting by Winslet and Carrey and the soundtrack is quite enchanting. I suppose the storyline does touch the emotional nerves of anyone who has been in love and felt pain from it, but nothing I haven't seen done better in other (mostly \"World Cinema\") movies. The direction and style of the movie is nothing revolutionary (contradicting a point raised quite often here).I was wondering was it something to do with the general reviews of the film? One trend I've found on IMDb is that the vast majority of people tend to echo what reviews have said about a film, even if they (deep down) don't feel that way themselves about it? I'm not sure, I tend not to read reviews until after I've watched a film.I gave the film 6/10 as I was feeling generous. It really doesn't deserve anything more than this.\n",

      "My daughter loaned me this movie two weeks ago and I finally tried to watch it last night. I'll admit that I am not a big Jim Carey fan, but he does alright in some films, The Truman Show and Liar, Liar are two that I enjoyed. What I didn't like is that I found nobody in this film that I liked. There wasn't a single character that was somebody I felt I'd like to meet. Some of the scenes seemed either badly acted or badly written, or both. The scene when Joel first met Clementine on the train seemed like it was written by middle school wannabe writers. The ridiculous scenes inside Joel's apartment while his memories of Clementine were being erased seemed like something out of a bad seventies anti cultural movie. Who could really believe that this crew would be so blatantly juvenile. They acted like 14 year old kids left alone for the weekend.My daughter really liked this movie, I really didn't. According to this films score (8.6) and it's standing in the top 250 (currently # 36) I must be wrong, and maybe I am, but to me this movie stands in the middle of the mediocre 50,000, a very unremarkable film.\n",

Unfortunately, as in so many cases, once you have seen the trailer, the film is identical but has been made about two hours longer. The end result is that you already know what is going to happen and are left waiting for the end so that you can leave to talk about how bad it all was...I desperately wanted this film to be good. I hoped it would be as visually dramatic as the previews suggested. I prayed the cast would live up to their reputations and bring it alive.

      "This isn't really a movie review. It's more a reaction. After watching this movie, I feel like running around screaming, \"You're missing the point! You're missing the point!\" Perhaps I'm missing the point. The film gets kudos for being clever and quirky and well-filmed, in a Being John Malkovich kind of way. Clever, quirky, but there's a spiritual barrenness underlying it. Shouldn't art be more than clever? Shouldn't it reach deeper? Limericks are clever ¬ñ we don't call them art. The underlying message in Eternal Sunshine isn't all that original. I am tired of seeing movies about love and loneliness. How many movies have we all seen whose basic point is that if you just reach out, take a chance, find romance, this will fend off the ravening wolves of loneliness at the door of modern life? In a culture that desperately needs a sense of community and connection, peddling movies and songs about romance is like giving cotton candy to a starving person.It isn't what we need! Finding romance is not the way to fend off loneliness and alienation, a change in the culture is. If we all felt connected to something that mattered, to other living things, to communities we cared about, romances wouldn't be the be-all and end-all of meaningful existence, it would be just one among many of life's joys.\n",

      "I usually like this kind of film - anything that looks at why we do the things we do, takes a character or two lovers on a winding and beautiful road through all kinds of confusion until they finally get hold of themselves again.The premise is obvious enough but with plenty of scope to tell a good story. Unfortunately it just isn't told well enough. The thing with any story like this is that you really have to invest yourself in the protagonists for it to work. Otherwise it just becomes academic, an interesting question but one where you're not too bothered about the answer. There's a problem with performances and material. Carrey plays a roughly similar role to Truman in the Truman Show, but with so little nuance in the script and evidently something lacking in the direction, he doesn't manage nearly the depth of that character, and none of the humour. Much the same applies to Winslett, who just doesn't seem to have any material to work with.As I say, it's a shame, because there's a great cast here and a good idea - it would have worked if they'd spent a few months more working on the script. As it is, despite this being exactly my kind of film, I'm surprised by the overridingly positive response here.\n",

I actually felt I wasted 2 hours of my life I can never get back. I also know 9 other people who rented this mess and hated it just as much. The video clerk called this movie a \"stinker.\" I know I am in the minority here. But I stand by what I say. I would never watch this movie again. Jim Carrey cannot do drama. In fact, he is not much of an actor. He's just a modern day Jerry Lewis. When he attempts to express anguish, he puts on his typical rubber face expressions. I know I am gonna get lots of flack for saying this. But I hated hated hated this movie. It was weird in a bad way, totally stupid, and a waste of Kirsten Dunsts talents. For those of you who praise this film, more power to you. I'll never ever watch it again. I thought it made the \"Friday the 13th\" films look like Oscar winners. Seriously.

I felt out of the loop, but, I suppose that's just going to have to be alright, because I refuse to like this piece of bile.First off, the plot revolves around a pretty lame plot device, namely a memory erasing company. Some people really do forget other human beings, even those they've been romantically involved with, so why rely on this lame device? Charlie Kaufman's funny dialogue and interesting plots have gone out the window, making way for some incredibly bad lines, like, \"Do you think I'm ugly?\" I just hate listening to the characters talk; they are some of the most repulsive, unlikeable characters committed to the screen. Kate Winslet's character in particular I wanted to smack. I mean, how is it possible I can stand a four hour movie starring a rapacious gangster (Once Upon a Time in America) and can't not walk out on this under-two hour claptrap starring decent humans? I wouldn't want to spend ten minutes with these bastards, let alone 100 minutes.Kirsten Dunst starts dancing in her underwear. Whoop-de-doo. Mark Ruffalo makes a mistake. Elijah Wood looks like a chihuahua. Jim Carrey looks ill. Kate Winslet spaces out and annoys the hell out of me. No actor in the movie has a breakout performance, not even Jim Carrey, who's just as annoying as he is in his comedic films. Even the score by the otherwise talented Jon Brion sucks! It's like everything that touches this movie instantly turns to sh*t.The direction, courtesy of mediocre music video director Michel Gondry, is not even worth mentioning. It's ridiculous. All of it is done very ambitiously, but most of the time it just feels stupid and over-the-top.In all, I found a predictable, bland, overrated, steaming piece of tripe.

And I have to say the hype is well deserved.\n",
      "The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind centers around an estranged couple's decisions to erase their respective memories of each other. this movie has a very unique/surreal approach of arranging sequences, with the bulk of the plot unraveling in a dreamlike state, which is a considerable divergence away from Jim Carrey's previous slapstick efforts. We see him reflecting on his memories of Clementine (Kate Winslet) in an almost melancholy undertone. He proved yet again, after his stellar performance in The Truman Show, his acting talents, as well as The Academy's biases against comedians.\n",
      "That being said, this movie is far from perfection. For me the subplot of Kristen Dunst and Tom Wilkinson could be further explored, as it accords with the theme of this movie. And the placement of the opening sequence may be a tad questionable. But who cares? at the end of the day The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind is without a doubt one of Jim Carrey's finest works and will be remembered and revered for years to come.\n",

      "When people ask other people what Jim Carrey's best acting performance is, people usually light up and say, \"The Truman Show!\" Although I would say that he gave a good performance in The Truman Show, in my opinion I think that he gives a much better performance in this movie, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Although this opinion definitely isn't everyone's, I think that this is Jim Carrey's best performance because he goes out of his daily routine as an actor that works in comedy and stand-up and usually he acts in his films with the same personality which is undeniably a humorous one. But with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Jim Carrey goes out of his routine and gives us a subtle, grief-causing performance that is entirely the opposite of his usual personality and yet it still feels natural as if it were his usual personality. In this film I saw a lot of serious acting talent shine through him that I had never seen him show before and if you're like me and enjoy seeing actors be in a different, unusual personality that they usually aren't in I think you'll enjoy this too.Another reason why you may enjoy this movie is because of it's dream-like surrealism. There are so many psychological tricks in this film that make the film feel like an incoherent dream such as the disjointed editing, the unnatural situations and the emotionally dreamy soundtrack. Also, you know how when you dream you can be doing something in one room and the next minute be in a completely different building? I thought I was the only one, but here Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind captures this fully in a movie and letting us transform into frankly a hallucinatory drug trip. If you're like me and enjoy the weirdness of dreaming I think you'll enjoy this too.What are you waiting for? An emotional, devastating, honest movie that feels like a dream with wonderful performances from the entire cast and interesting, realistic characters as a sidedish.

      "What a story. Emotions in utter tumult after watching this. (What to do next? Well, I guess I'll finish the review. But why? What's the point?) It has a sci-fi premise that would ordinarily put me off but the whirling story never veers off its hub of exploring love. And anyway, the SF treatment is administered by Tom Wilkinson, who never disappoints. Speaking of actors, the ever brilliant Kate Winslet is at the top of her game here. It's so easy to go over the top when you're playing the crazy one and just take us into zany land and leave reality behind, but the story demands that she keeps it more real and she exercises such exquisite control. I wonder how Jim Carrey would have played that role! Don't get me wrong, he's fantastic too here as the more down-to-earth one - probably his best performance that I've seen and a clever bit of casting. Wait, I've got an odd feeling in my gut. Oh, dear! I think I need to go and run in a big open field for a bit. I might be back, .\n",

      "It's not possible for me to review this movie without giving any spoilers. Viewers discretion.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is one those movies which makes you fall in love with it even more, every time you watch it. There is nothing usual about this movie and people have mixed views about it. But I think it's mesmerizing.This movie is about Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) and how they fall in and out of love. The movie beautifully shows the fear of losing a loved one without actually showing death. Most of the film actually takes place in Joel's mind after he decides to erase Clementine from his mind, who has already erased Joel from hers. Following which, Joel goes through a roller-coaster of emotions as he regrets his decision. In addition to the plot and the outstanding performance of the actors, the dialogues are like the cherry on the cake. Towards the end when Joel realizes that he cannot save Clementine's memories, he looks helplessly and longingly at her.Clementine: This is it Joel. It's going to be gone soon.Joel: What do we do? Clementine: Enjoy it. There are also other elements such as Clementine has different colored hair to make viewers differentiate the present from Joel's memories. This film is undoubtedly one of the finest works of Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry. In conclusion, this film is about two lost lovers and their journey of finding each other and falling in love, all over again.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is definitely the best movie of 2004. Charlie Kaufman (Screenplay Writer) and Michel Gondry (Director) use memory erasing as a plot, but it actual works! The film shows the love story of two people (Joel and Clementine) who gravitated toward each other on a train, and end up falling in love. Clementine (played by Kate Winslet) ends up becoming unhappy in the relationship, and seeks out a company in which erases your memory, thus leading Joel (played by Jim Carrey) to do the same. The Best way to describe this film for me is being on a familiar roller coaster, but once you get on, it does the most unique and crazy movements, and the ride is evoking several emotions. From the opening scene, this movie starts gripping your attention, and it doesn't lose that firm grip until the very end of the film, where it makes you want more. Charlie Kaufman has stated in several interviews that he wants his film to be like a open discussion for the audience, and that he wants different reactions from his movie, because everyone is different. This movie for sure accomplishes everything that he said he wanted in his films. Michel Gondry, in my opinion, gets out the best performances for both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and all the supporting actors are very strong as well. There is for sure no lazy acting here. Everyone seems like they really honestly loved this project. Michel and Charlie pull off some of the best transitions and practical effects I have ever seen in a film. Every effect in this movie ties back into the plot in a way that's so unique, and makes you wonder how someone can be this clever. The cinematography in this film is just astonishing in the best way for a 2004 film. The shots are breathtaking, and tie in so perfectly to the characters feelings and overall plot. One example would be one of my favorite scenes in the movie where Joel and Clementine are talking in a memory where she is at work stocking books. If you observe the shot, you would be able to view that the books in the background of the shot start losing their titles and overall color. This ties into how it would be in a dream where you are losing your memories, thus removing things in the background one by one. This was a super clever thing to add to the film, and a bunch of things like this are in the film for you to catch on repeated viewings. Overall the performances in this film are amazing, the transitions and effects are near flawless, the pace of this movie is amazing, it never makes you feel like checking the time, the message in this movie is brutally honest, making it very bittersweet. This movie will make you cry, laugh, smile, enraged, blue, and much more other emotions. It has very amazing cross over appeal and overall, this is my 2nd favorite film of all time. For sure buy this movie, pop it in once in a while, because every time you watch this, you can pick up something new each time. Repeated viewings show how truly genius this film is, so go watch it, now! If you want...\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind understands what relationships are like in a way that is uncanny. While masquerading as a happy movie about a loving couple, Eternal Sunshine shows the darkest and most harmful parts of relationships.The film is about Joel (Jim Carrey) a guy in his thirties who has dated a quirky woman named Clementine (Kate Winslet). Their relationship is difficult and marred with unhappiness. When Clementine stops talking to him inexplicably, he finds that she has had an operation that erased all her memories of their relationship. Joel is distraught and gets the same operation. The film then becomes a narrative within Joel's head as he relives all of his memories with Clementine as they are erased.The narrative is experimental, completely fragmented with some scenes that are bizarre within Joel's head. This leads to some unique, memorable, and just plain weird moments. This uniqueness gives the film its identity and the lack of linearity in the dreams both leaves the viewer the fun job of piecing together a narrative on his own while also giving the filmmakers license to contrast memories directly against each other, even when they are from different time periods.Our characters are very quirky and not entirely likable at first. Joel is reserved and awkward, a combination that initially turned me off to his character. Clementine, on the other hand, is very expressive and emotional- perhaps to a fault. it isn't until you see the best moments these people shared together when you begin to like them. Both the characters and the film itself feel very genuine when we see their happy moments.What is the ultimate point of Eternal Sunshine? (SPOILERS follow) What does it have to say? In the end, Joel and Clementine stay together. They know all of the horrible things that they will do to each other and they stay together anyway. The audience is happy that they stay together.Why do they stay together? An optimist would say that it is because they are meant to be. It seems unlikely that two people would happen to fall in love again if they had no memory of their history. Maybe some people are just soulmates and they will always find each other. In fact, the same phenomenon occurs to the Kirsten Dunst character when her memories are erased- she finds the same man and falls in love with him again.The more pessimistic answer, and in my opinion the real answer to the question is that people tend to ignore obvious red flags when starting a relationship they are excited about. The two leads share one day together, having fun as \"strangers\" before they are given documents telling them about their past relationship. Joel and Clementine have hard physical evidence that proves they are incompatible. Their original relationship became unhappy and borderline abusive, and the two of them have documents that detail exactly how much they come to hate each other. This is the biggest red flag that a person could ever receive: hard proof that the relationship won't work. Still, the two of them are excited about their budding relationship and their first day together, so they ignore this giant red flag and date anyway. They don't look at the documents and see how they can better their relationship, they just blindly get back together, doomed to fall into the same traps they did before, because it is the easy choice and the exciting choice. The movie ends on an optimistic note, but a viewer has to wonder about the dark implications of this and the ignorance that it takes for them to stay together.When Joel is going through the memories of his relationship, there is an overwhelming feeling both in him and in the audience that he should stay with Clementine because the two of them have such good memories together. In essence: it doesn't matter that the relationship has grown into something horrible and toxic, they should stay together because they used to be happy and they need to hold on to those happy memories. Any person who has seen a relationship through knows this feeling as the end nears. This movie makes the audience actively cheer for that outcome. It's not until you think back on the movie's message that you realize how delusional this idea is.The main points the film is making are common justifications that people have to stay in broken relationships: it's easy to ignore red flags, no matter how large, and it's hard to break up with someone you have good memories with. It's eerie how easy it is for the audience to cheer for these irrational justifications, and it tells us something about ourselves.In all, Eternal Sunshine is a romantic film that really knows what long-term relationships and toxic relationships are like. The more engaged viewer will leave with an interesting message about the darkness of relationships. I strongly recommend the movie as a study of the irrational behavior people have when in relationships.\n",

      "What an exciting time to be alive! We can actually go to our corner theater and participate in the invention of a new medium. Fundamental elements of the vocabulary are still being explored and invented.I knew that I was witnessing something important halfway through. Superficially this is another Kaufman exercise in self-reference. Those are always interesting, he knows how to fold the story with methods of telling the story plus a third story about those methods. There's some of that here, but it is shoehorned into the 'big idea' that wasn't his in the first place. So although you have one of the most powerful folding actors ever (Winslet), the real advance here is in another area.Hundreds of films have tried to portray dreams and visions, folding them into 'reality.' Some are blunt ('What Dreams may Come'), others frantic ('Pi') and puzzling('Mulholland Dr'). No one has yet managed the arbitrary slipperiness of visions as successfully as Tarkovsky in 'Nostalgia.' Part of Tarkovsky's genius is in making ordinary objects exotic by bending the context. But he does his work in large chunks. Any filmmaker, the real ones, make an early decision about the materials of their creation, just as an architect does. In architecture, you can choose to make the structure out of bricks. These things actually hold the building up. Then you have to design the brick. What's the right size?Tarkovsky used large bricks, so we could read them from a distance. Rodriguez , for instance, in his second act of 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico,' used what looks like small bricks, but they are just for show: they carry no narrative.What we have here are small bricks, small minivignettes that come at blinding speed from all tenses and actually hold up the narrative. You need an intelligent actor to help carry this off and in this case we have the redoubtable Kate who is one of our most intelligent masters of this sort of architectural material. After all, her very first film ('heavenly Creatures') was about this same matter: how small a fantasy or memory could be and still create reality.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.\n",

      "I have to admit, I am sorry, but I don't like the film. It's been two years since I first watched it, and with a poor memory like mine, I have completely forgotten what it is all about. The only memory I have about it is the essay I wrote as an assignment, from which I know I didn't feel a thing about it as many people do. I also remember one of its lesson, that is you can't just ignore your mistakes, you have to look them in the face‚Äîlook them really hard to be able to learn something from them‚Äîotherwise you are gonna to make the same mistakes again and again. Unless you make a change, this will be a never-ending process. Lots of things have happened since the latter half of last year. I have experienced many frustrations, I have been under huge stress, and I began to be aware of my own existence again‚Äîthe last time that I did was in my junior year, when I was involved in a vortex of mixed feelings dealing with my contenting roommates. When I repeatedly make the same mistakes, the lesson of the film comes to me, and I tell myself: \"See how you got here. You are careless to the lessons life teaches you. Be smart next time.\" Therefore, I want to watch the film again, to see if I will change my mind, since it has such a depth, it helps me avoid old mistakes. But after I finished it, I still don't like it. I did change, however. The problem with it, as I see it this time, is with the way the director presents it. The humor, which he may think as a plus or as something that will make it entertaining, is exactly what ruins the film. He could have reduced some of the humorous scenes because they don't fit in with the whole tone. For example, people will laugh when they know that the young guy from the clinic steals Clement's underwear. But what't the point of that? Or, the scene that while Joel is trying hard to keep his memory, Mary and Stan were actually having a party on his bed. Maybe he wants to indicate the absurdity of the whole erasing thing, or that's his satire of the commercial world where people only care about money and are not sympathetic to your feelings, but he could have used another way. The sad love story and the kinds of humor of irresponsibility and all form a really weird combination. It may be better if the director sticks with only one of them. As for the love part, I don't feel a thing, either. Maybe I have passed the stage of life when you dream about a person who will love you as if you are the only thing he has. Rather, I respect the fact that we are two equal people, we have our own concerns, and we are together because we seem to form good partners to live the rest of our lives. I don't want him to interfere with my life too much, because there are many things to do except love. By the way, Jim Carrey is very handsome!\n",

      "Kate Winslett is always good. And I love seeing Carrey play \"normally\" for a change. But as with Memento, I find going through the memories boring, could have done without half as much of that. Too bad somehow, the movie could have been so much more compact with some added cutting. I suppose it was meant to be confusing, and it is so at times. For really good acting, I give it a seven, otherwise I would have given a six or a five.. I like many slow-paced movies - like Fargo or Smoke, but with this movie my hand started to move by itself toward the fast forward button of the DVD remote, and that's not good =) I thought long and hard about this, and maybe the worst thing about this movie is, that there simply aren't any deep truths, philosophies or revelations etc. to keep you occupied.. definitely NOT worth the Oscars.\n",

However tis is not for the low intelligent people out there who wish to only see blood and explosions, while those kinds of things are entertaining, they aren't much without a story, and this was a movie with a lot of wonderful story, and it wasn't quite 2 hours!Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is living Proof that the best stories are not found in big over priced Hollywood popcorn movies, but with people who put time, effort, and love into writing a script, and producing a movie that will both entertain, shock, and leave the viewer speechless with how thought provoking and moving the film truly is.

      "After almost 20 mind-numbingly incomprehensible minutes that seemed so much longer, it comes as a shock to realize that what one is suddenly seeing floating across the screen is (after 20 minutes, remember) the \"opening\" credits of the movie. This can mean only one thing - and it isn't good news: sweet Jesus, there's still an entire movie to come.I confess that I'm not entirely enamoured of Jim Carrey. I've seen him as a weak part of a good movie (Bruce Almighty) and as the strong part of a weak movie (The Grinch Who Stole Christmas). Either way, he doesn't turn my crank. I don't think I'd ever watch a movie just because the star was Jim Carrey. To be honest, in \"Eternal Sunshine ...\" I'm not sure if he's strong or weak, but it really doesn't matter because the story is absurd, disjointed and not really all that interesting. It had potential. The whole \"erasing negative memories\" had a vaguely Orwellian tone to it that intrigued me (which is why I rented it) but in the end it failed badly. When I find myself hoping (even yearning) for a movie to come to an end, I know it's been a disaster.The most intriguing thing about this movie is the following statement right off the DVD jacket it came in: [\"Eternal Sunshine ... is] a memorable film that the Wall Street Journal calls 'a romantic comedy unlike any other.\" I can't argue with that - it is \"memorable\" (no matter how hard I'll try to, I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it) and it is \"a romantic comedy unlike any other.\" Give thanks for small mercies - this truly is one of a kind, and, in truth, there must never be another like it. 1/10\n",

      "Focus is an independent production company which dwells on the non-conventional \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is, to say the least, a non-conventional film!! This movie, which is a purveyor of many Molotov Mardi Gras emotions, authenticates an equivocal potpourri of ideas that are indicative of numerous independent production company films!! This movie also bears a striking similarity to Elia Kazan's intensity to itemize belligerent confrontation!! \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is sort of a counter culture version of the film \"The Arrangement\". Many films that are run of the mill mainstream Hollywood movies immediately hack out a succinct and concise mindset of everyone of the major character's feelings. In \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" to say that Joel's (Jim Carey) feelings were introverted, would be a paramount utterance of understatement!! Joel's relationship with Clementine,( a name we associate with a folklore about loving regrets, also, with a particular type of orange) evokes a vivid presentation which signifies an emotional diligence. The illogical transition to their pursuing ideas and trepidations compound an inexplicably and unnecessary intransigence for both of them!! The ephemeral activities in this film perpetuate a cerebral anguish which becomes the heinous culprit to Joel and Clementine's difficulty to adequately dissect their conceptions about one another!! I could see this film 100 times and still not capture every intricate detail to it!! Set in a New York City neighborhood, it depicts a realism about imperfection being ubiquitous in all of the character's lives!! This movie had a foreign flare to it as well!! In fact, I initially thought this film took place in Montreal... After viewing a couple of scenes, I, of course, blew that contention out the window!! My first clue was when I saw the New York License plates on every single one of the cars!! Jim Carey is FABULOUS!! in this movie!! Originally known as the box office star of copious high profit zany comedies, his enormous popularity garnered an auspicious association with the light hearted!! In \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", his role was very serious and complex!! Think about it though, if someone were to handwrite a silly comedy, and then, all of a sudden, he was required to change this screenplay to a serious drama, it would be a case of simply needing to borrow someone's erasure for no more than 18 seconds!! Kate Winslet is superb in this film as well!! I did not even know she was British!! When the acting in a movie is so excellent, it almost appears as though the writers and directors of the film are getting paid only about a buck above minimum wage!! \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a remarkable movie, and is considered to be one of the best films ever made according to this website!! The step by step thought process to this film puts this movie in a category all by itself!! Marvelous flick!! Focus Productions always gives way to the unorthodox, perhaps you as a movie viewer should try doing the very same thing once in awhile too!! FIVE STARS!!!! ABSOLUTELY!!\n",

      "Hands down one my most favorite movies of all time, starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet is a brilliantly directed movie from Michel Gondry.Plot : A girl highly impulsive and the guy a calm and soft spoken gets in love and the love is gone bad. A new service opens up where they promise to erase part of your memory, the girl gets her lover erased from her memory and starts a new life. When the guy gets to know this he gets frustrated and gets an appointment to do the same. The plot starts to travel in reverse direction from the last memory of the couple getting erased. The guy gets to see the memory getting erased from him and after a point of time thinks he has taken a bad decision and tries to stop the process by trying to hide his girlfriends memory in old memories where the doctors cant reach, but it goes in vain and all the memories of them gets erased from the guys head without a spot. Finally what happens to this couple is what the whole movie is about.A very complex story telling technique, you need to watch it twice to truly appreciate the effort and ingeniousness of the script. I always felt Jim is a very underrated actor and my notion got stronger after watching this movie. Memento was my top rated movie till I saw this movie, a definite #1.Review : A truly unique script and a genius story telling, a \"MUST\" watch for all!.. 9.5/10! :)\n",

      "Everyone at some point feels like Joel Barish.Joel has decided to erase his girlfriend Clementine from his memory. Literally. That's only fair though, because she has already had Joel erased from hers.Apparently, there is a medical treatment that can do that...as the doctor who pioneered the technology explains, \"Technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage.\" If only it was that simple.Joel and Clementine are extremely complicated thirtysomethings who because of their many flaws and quirks actually make a perfect match. Most importantly, they love each other. We learn this along with many other bizarre and fascinating details as the film traces every memory Joel has of their problematic relationship. The labyrinthine journey through his mind takes the fuzzy fantastical form of dreams: some of his memories of Clementine are nightmares, but quite a few are startlingly beautiful treasures. It is these that Joel desperately tries to salvage, but by the time he realizes how he feels it may already be too late.Over the course of the film we also meet the entire staff of Lacuna, Inc., the four-person medical firm who is systematically destroying Joel's memory of Clementine. These are very weird people. Collectively they resemble the sort of slapstick professionalism you might witness late night at a video store. Still, as the plot (and Joel's memory) unravels, we discover that memories may be fleeting, but the past is absolute. Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The careless employees of Lacuna Inc. experience this truth as their lives intersect, parallel, and collide with Joel and Clementine and one another. Their struggle through the night against Joel's memory of his love will change each of their lives forever. What I like about movies written by Charlie Kaufman is that in an underhanded, diabolical way the film itself is always asking the audience questions. So even if you could somehow willfully change what you remember, could you ever really change how you feel? And does Fate even care about what you remember? Paradoxically, Joel and Clementine seem perpetually destined to be together, and equally doomed to break up. To me, that is the one unanswered question that lingers long after the credits roll: \"Does love overcome fate, or does fate overcome love?\" In the real world there may not be an answer, but in the present reality of Joel and Clementine, I think the answer is both.How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd. -- Alexander Pope, \"Eloisa to Abelard\"\n",

      "It took me a little while to work this movie out because it was a little odd at the beginning. Okay, I knew it was about how a man (Joel) was having all memory of his ex-girlfriend (Clementine) erased from his memory, and that it is basically a love story in reverse, but as I said the beginning left me a little baffled. Basically Joel goes to the beach and meets Clementine and they begin to hit it off and after their first date he parks outside her house so she can get her toothbrush and some guy comes up to him and asks him what he is doing. Suddenly it jumps to a scene where he is driving home crying, and for a while I thought there was a sudden jump of two years to when they had broken up. When, later on in the movie, the scene where they first met was completely different to the opening scenes of the movie I was under the impression that there was a huge continually stuff up. However, how can a movie, with a huge continually stuff up, get a rating of over 8 on IMDb? Well, all is explained in the end.As I mentioned, this is basically a love story in reverse. The story begins after they have broken up and Joel discovers that Clementine has had him completely erased from his memory, so he goes and visits the same doctor to have the procedure done to him as well. This is when we get to the core of the movie as it jumps between Joel's memory and events going on in Joel's bedroom with the people who are doing the erasing. Thus what we have are in effect two stories going on which at first do not seem to be related at all, but slowly become interrelated.The way this film has been set out makes it quite different to the 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl again' typical Hollywood theme. If seen in the normal order then that is basically what the film is, but it isn't. The film begins with the break up and then we watch, through Joel's memories as they are progressively being erased, the relationship as it unfolded. However, the relationship begins with the break up, and then moves through the fights ‚Äì all of the painful parts ‚Äì however things begin to change when we get to the good parts ‚Äì the parts that Joel does not want to forget. Joel knows what is going on, and when he realises that all of the good parts of the relationship are being removed he suddenly wants it to stop, and thus we have this psychological fight where is tries his best to retain his memories, while the doctors on the outside are fighting to complete the process.I guess sometimes, especially when we go through painful experiences, we would like them to be removed from our memory so they do not come back to haunt us, but the question is then raised is that healthy, and is it possible. We are told at the beginning that all evidence of the relationship must be removed because by seeing (or even hearing) one element from that relationship can end up triggering those forgotten memories. This is where the film gets interesting because one of the assistants, who assisted in Clementine having her memory erased, falls in love with her and uses his knowledge to start a relationship with her. However therein lies the problem ‚Äì while she may have forgotten, he hasn't, and what is worse, he is using the knowledge that he gained from assisting Joel in deepening the relationship, but this has an opposite effect.Then there is what is going on on the outside, but I won't go any further than that because I have already pretty much spoiled the movie (even though I have put a spoiler alert on this review). However, what I picked up in the movie is the idea of removing memories (and it appears that many are well aware of this aspect as well). Just because we have bad memories, or more precisely, memories that hurt us, does not mean that they are useless. First of all our memories define who we are, whether they are pleasant or not, and to remove those memories will end up undermining our character. Secondly, if we seek to remove the bad memories it does not mean that only our good memories will remain. As can be seen in this film, the good memories of the relationship are inextricably tied up with the bad, so by removing the bad, we are also removing the good. It is clear that Joel wanted all of the bad memories removed, but when he suddenly realised that these bad memories were connected to the good memories, and the good memories were also being removed, that was when he wanted it to stop. Finally, just because all of the bad memories are removed does not necessarily mean that we will not repeat the same mistakes. In fact, by removing them means that we are more likely to do so. As Winston Churchill once said: he who forgets the past is doomed to repeat its mistakes.\n",

In the end, the two decide what they have is worth fighting for. As far as the sci-fi element I was a little skeptical because I'm not usually drawn to science fiction, but in the movie it's treated as a normal thing and its really only a plot device.

In desperation, Joel contacts the company that carried out the treatment and ask to get the same procedure done on him to get rid of all memories of the same thing. When memories are and go through Joel's head, he discovers why he fell in love with Clementine from the start.This movie - can not be anything else than a beautiful and amazing journey in a person's memory and dreams. Director Michel Gondry shows here his visual inventiveness but also excellent personal trainer. Kate Winslet shines perfectly in the role of the impulsive and extremely extroverted Clementine. Jim Carrey, as you usually see in cheesy overplayed comedy, show here the ability to do a little more personal and dark matter when he plays the introverted, gloomy and slightly smug Joel. To only see the movie once must be a huge loss, I've seen it several times and always find something new with it. It is necessary to be alert when you see this film - it takes great mental power to successfully connect everything that happens. The first time you see the movie you think it is very messy and cluttered scenes are completely mismatched. But on closer reflection, everything is extremely well thought out and every scene is absolutely right. The last ten minutes of the film are the hardest to watch - then tied the whole course of events in the movie together and the pieces are in place. This is a masterpiece - Michel Gondry's best, Jim Carrey's best and Absolutely Kate Winslet's best.

To me the movie sounded like a silly comedy movie but it is in fact just the opposite. The tone of Eternal Sunshine is rather dark and serious most of the time.I was hooked instantly with Jim Carrey's narration. It was brilliant, i instantly empathized with his character. At first you see Joel depression caused by his break up with Clementine. Later in the movie you see several of Joel and Clementines good and bad memories. Along the course Joel realizes his mistake in erasing Clementine and internally struggles with himself and the people performing the process of removing his memories to keep his memories of Clementine.I felt deep empathy for Joel every memory sad, funny, happy or cruel i felt it as Joel did. Jim Carrey is great in this role. His character is just average Joe, a real easy person to relate to. Winslet creates a unique but still believable character in Clementine. She played the role great. Winslet and Carry's chemistry was great.The shots were great but every so often the distorted memories got a little to crazy, it was a little disturbing and kind of over the top but maybe that was what the director intended.Anyone can like this movie. Those who like craft in their movies and those who just like a good love story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a one of a kind love story with brilliant acting, great editing and sound with a terrific plot.\n",

      "This movie is extremely rare. But I say that in he good way. It's hard to find a moving film like this one. That is why I think that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is beyond reason. But love is beyond reason as well, and that is what this film is about.Everyone can relate to this movie, because who didn't suffer for love sometime? Love is a complex concept that can't be explained. This movie shows us that like no other could. This is the opposite of all romantic movies. It's very original and very warn as it is sad as well. Both main actors gave excellent performances and their relationship felt authentic like no other relationship on screen.Jim Carrey is a really good actor when it comes to drama. I personally dislike most of his exaggerated comedies but he did a terrific job here and in The Truman Show for example. I think that he should choose more carefully his roles, because there are some roles where he can show he actually has talent. Kate on the other hand is always great.Everyone should take a look on this title since almost everyone can relate to the characters, and although it's a sad movie it is still highly enjoyable.\n",

      "They made it over-complicated. Over-Confusing. The Plot was good, but the screenplay and direction was not that good. Overrated.\n",

      "So there were quite a few giveaways that the movie begins after the erasure. Sometimes it becomes a little tedious when keeping up with the chronology of events. Not for this title though. It dove straight into it.I'm giving this title a 5/10 because it falls short in some areas that I felt were prominent and should have been addressed better.1) Rob & Carrie are Joel's friends. Understood. Clem's note about the erasure should not have reached Joel at all. But it reaches Rob & Carrie who are Joel's friends. If they wanted what's best for him, why show him the note at all?2) While being briefed about the erasure process, Joel is instructed to stick to the memories & then \"discard all the evidence that would cause the memories to claw back up\". It is later revealed that Mary had a crush on Dr. Mierzwiak and that she had the procedure done on her. Sticking to the idea of \"discard all the evidence\", it makes no sense why Mary would be allowed to continue working at the office.3) During the erasure process, Joel realizes that he does want to keep some memories of Clem intact. He then proceeds to hide the imaginary version of Clem that himself has made up in his mind. This Clem is accepting, docile & wants Joel to be with her forever. In the real world however, Clem has the erasure performed on her as she finds Joel \"boring\". I see no value or sense in hanging onto the idea of a person that you yourself have constructed in your mind about a person. Specially considering it was Clem who got the erasure first. Clearly she wanted to forget Joel.4) It is downright sick that Patrick tries to woo Clem by using the same material as Joel. Clearly, he is seeking comfort in Clem & wants to be accepted but I have to keep myself from punching Patrick in the nuts because what he did was downright monstrous. Pretty sure it breaks some kind of company policy as well to not pursue \"erased\" clients.5) The scene with Stan, Patrick & Mary when they're erasing Joel's memories was beyond ridiculous & thoroughly unprofessional. What kind of sick, sadistic freaks are wiping a client's memories & fall asleep presumably after having had sex or getting stoned? Moreover, how did Mary know where the house was? Why was she there in the first place?6) When Dr. Mierzwiak is called, he writes the address down on a paper. Common sense would dictate that you would take the paper with you to find the address. It is never made clear what happens but the Dr.'s wife showing up & revealing the truth about Mary.7) Mary is just a secretary. How does she get access to a locked up office let alone all the confidential files?8) Mary decides to expose the company by writing a letter to all the patients telling them that she's a part of a company that the patients hired to have part of their memories erased. This slams the final nail in the coffin of stupidity.Firstly, because there is a scene where Mary is on the phone telling Mrs. Sobel that she cannot have the procedure for a third time in the same month. This clearly indicates that the patient would still remember the clinic & the workers i.e. Mary herself & it is quoted by the Dr. himself that \"You'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened\". No clarity is provided here.Lastly, in Mary's tape to the patients, she says that \"she's decided that this is horrible.\". Who in their right mind gave Mary the authority to decide the potential fate of the company if SHE finds it horrible? The patients clearly know what they are in for. Heck, they're PAYING for the procedure too. If nothing else, this move would've backfired & create more of a customer base for Lacuna.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind directed by Michel Gondry is one of the most outstanding, original and riveting movies I have ever seen. Charlie Kauffman does it again with a spectacular and uniquely original screenplay accompanied by phenomenal performances from Jim Carrey (as Joel Bash) and Kate Winslet (as Clementime). Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind perfectly orchestrates subtle moments, heartfelt experiences and other key features of film and story telling in order to create a master piece of emotion, action and truth.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind depicts Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) undergoing a procedure to rid himself of the memory of his ex girlfriend Clementime (Kate Winslet) after discovering she had already undergone the same procedure. Written by Charlie Kauffman, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the most original and well written screen play of the century. With it shining light on subtle moments whilst also producing some of the most heartfelt moments in cinema history. The use of subtly is effectively used throughout to produce symbolist if meanings not usually presented in your everyday film. This rewards viewers who pay attention to the little details and immerses the audience deeper into the film. Each character was beautifully constructed and manipulated so as to have the viewer exactly where they need to be throughout the film. Also as expected in a Charlie Kauffman screenplay, heavy symbolism is used throughout so as the audience can delve deeper into the film. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind also has a unique re- watch-ability due to this originality, detail and amazing characters. This is also a movie I would more then definitely recommend to watch more then once, as lots of details are lost throughout.Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet perform superbly throughout which greatly increased the immersion throughout. Special credit given to Winslett as she performed phenomenally throughout and was a perfect fit for her role. As for Jim Carrey I thought his acting was superb as well, with what felt like a whole other side to the actor. Also we see some great acting from the other side characters such as Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo who help tie together the whole story. Without these great actors I can imagine the movie would of never been quite up to the phenomenal level it currently is.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the most amazing, heartfelt and tremmendesly great movies and deserves recognition for every various aspect within\n",

      "I don't think anyone could possibly sum this movie up in any word but \"perfect\". It's so perfect that every time I watch it, I rate it one star higher. 10 stars is TRULY an understatement. This movie is one of--if not THE-- best movies I have seen. The characters and story mix together perfectly. The story is about a dull, shy man, Joel Barish, meets and falls in love with an eccentric, fantastically unique girl, Clementine Kruczynski. He learns she erased him from her memory and he does the same to her after learning this. That's all I will say, so I won't spoil anything. Now. I love this girl. I haven't loved a character like this ever since Ramona Flowers (I dunno, I have this thing for girls with unnatural hair colors). ANYWAYS. You will love her too. And you'll love Joel too. And You'll feel a deep sorrow for all the other \"unfortunate souls\", except Patrick. You will want to kill that little rat. I. Hate. That. Guy. But never fear, losers never win... The story and some of the movie may or may not make sense to some viewers (I understood it JUST enough the first time but I'll have to say that the second time watching it was BETTER.) And that sorta reminded me of when I watched Inception. You catch more that way. This is an intelligent, down-to-earth, loving, sad, triumphant, and deeply emotional (even if you rebuff your emotions 100%, you WILL get emotional. Because it's THAT good).And another thing, this isn't a mushy-gushy romance (BONUS!! I'm fist pumping) and I recommend watching this on a date, it will appeal both genders. I don't know what else to say other than I absolutely loved this movie. I don't know whether or not you'll like it but there's gotta be a reason you looked up this review. You're at least a LITTLE interested....\n",

      "Have you ever been in a relationship that you wish you could completely erase from your memory? Perhaps you fell out of love, perhaps your significant other was unfaithful, or perhaps it simply wasn't meant to be. This is the situation that Joel Barish is faced with in the superb Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.Jim Carrey plays Joel, a shy and unassuming bachelor who meets Clementine, a boisterous, fun loving dynamo who gives his mundane existence a considerable shot in the arm. Unfortunately for Joel, Clementine decides she has had enough and has all memory of him erased. Feeling understandably hurt, Joel decides that he also wants the operation and subsequently arranges a memory wipe of his own.The rest of the movie takes place in Joel's head as he realises he does not want to have the operation and proceeds to try and prevent it. It sounds a little confusing and, to some extent, it is. The high concept can take a little while to get your head around, but once you do, you will uncover an absolute gem of a romance. The fact that the movie takes place inside Joel's head gives director Michel Gondry the opportunity to fill the screen with some unforgettable images, such as a rainstorm in a living room and a fully grown Jim Carrey being bathed in the sink. But the true genius of Eternal Sunshine lies in its structure. The first half of the movie is quite gloomy as it focuses on the end of Joel and Clementine's relationship but, as the team begin to wipe earlier memories, we see what made the couple fall in love in the first place and we are treated to some truly heart warming scenes that never threaten to stray into cheesy territory.With Carrey playing against type as the close mouthed Joel, it falls to Kate Winslet to adopt the typical Carrey role, and she grabs the opportunity with both hands. Winslet's energy permeates every scene she is in and it is easy to see why Joel fell in love with her. A stellar supporting cast does good work with a slightly underwhelming sub-plot, but this is very much Joel and Clementine's movie and, by the time the credits roll, you will instantly want to watch it again if only to make sure you understood what just happened.A mind bending romance with a fantastically clever script and some outstanding imagery. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is one of the best romantic films you will ever see.\n",

      "Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) falls for Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) from the first moment they meet on a train. After a bad breakup, Clementine erases Joel from her memories. He decides to do the same to her. Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) are the three slacker technicians who are running Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson)'s machine. As his memories are eliminated, he starts to fall in love with Clementine all over again. He struggles to hold on to his memories before it's all gone.The premise is amazing, but it's the imaginative visualization of the process that puts in on another level. Jim Carrey pours his heart into this very difficult disjointed performance. It's very effecting and probably one of his best non-impersonation performance. In its core, it's a beautiful love story. It's funny. It's poignant.\n",

      "For some reason or another I had put off watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind until now, and I had no idea what I was missing. I came into the movie with preconceptions that it was a great, if not amazing movie, but I wasn't quite prepared for how moving Eternal Sunshine really was.In my honest opinion this is the best acting I have ever seen out of Jim Carey and even Kate Winslet..the chemistry these two share on the screen is an enjoyment in itself, and they do it with such short and artistically fragmented scenes, and by the middle of the movie I found myself caring about these characters.This is a movie about characters, personalities, love, and loss. The score, supporting actors/actresses, script, directing and especially the lead roles were all above and beyond my expectations..and all in all the movie was simply beautiful.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is one of the many masterpieces that proves why we all love film in the first place. Directed by French director Michel Gondry, and written by accomplished filmmaker Charlie Kaufman, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is equal part romantic comedy, psychological thriller, science-fiction, and non-linear narrative. Taking a break from comedy, the film stars Jim Carrey in a more dramatic performance as a man who volunteers to erase every single memory of him and his ex-girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, whom coincidentally has already done the same thing. The film then takes us on a wonderful and imaginative journey through this one man's mind, as he tries to fight against those who try to steal his memories away, while at the same time, trying to fight for the woman he loves. First-time director Michel Gondry makes his second directorial debut in such a stylish fashion. He perfectly guides the movie with enough clever execution and brilliant uniqueness. Writer Charlie Kaufman has written such a beautiful script that contains witty humor, sharp characters, and true dialouge, which was able to win him a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. Besides Carrey and Winslet, this remarkable cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson, all bringing such memorable performances on screen. But it's the romantic relationship between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet that carries the movie, and their adventures into trying to keep their memories together from falling apart. Jim Carrey may be more noticeable in more comedic-driven films, but he still provides great dramatic performances, and this is one of those movies that shows how great an actor he is. But, Kate Winslet is the scene-stealer, as the light-hearted, charismatic girlfriend, with a different choice of hair color in nearly every scene. It doesn't matter what role you give to Kate Winslet, because no matter what, she will still be awesome in the role! This movie also provides some of the beautiful uses of imagery that I have seen in a while. In a usual Charlie Kaufman movie, something weird always has to happen. Accompanied with a memorable soundtrack, beautiful effects, and stylish editing, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is pure filmmaking at it's finest. Although there were some characters that kind of got me annoyed, especially Elijah Wood's character, who seems sort of lost into his given performance. It was just a few moments where the movie loses a bit of it's magic. But, that doesn't hurt the movie's momentum, though! Those flaws are out-shined by how beautiful this movie has been made to look. This is probably one of my favorite movies, and it will definitely be a memorable one, as well. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", in my review, \"a magical romance, fantastically well-made film\".\n",

      "Creative. Brilliant. Dreamy. All that and even more. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an extraordinary story of love that goes beyond the limits of time and defies all rules of reality. I loved every second of it and I wouldn't mind watching it over and over again.The movie is about Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), a couple who decide to undergo a memory erasing procedure to forget each other after their relationship goes downhill. Only through this unusual experience do they embark on a journey to discover their true feelings, realizing that forgetting might be the easiest cure for pain but tolerating is definitely the best. The idea is absolutely crazy in an amazing way, and turning it into a moving picture with story, plot, characters and emotional charge must have been a painstaking task. The actual timeline and the dream sequence were craftily interwoven in a way that arises the viewer's curiosity with every passing second, and gradually holds a grip not only of his mind but of his heart as well.Kate Winslet played her character to perfection. She was the sunshine in the movie; her impulsive nature and spontaneous, fun-loving character contributed to the vividness of the story. Jim Carrey gave his lifetime best performance. He was so believable and mature I had to convince myself that this is the same Carrey who plays mainly sappy roles in inane comedies.A million kudoses for Charlie Kaufman's exquisite mind.\n",

      "Jim Carrey is known for his roles in screwball comedies, and it seemed as there was no way to get an actual clean break off from his normal goofy persona. It may have seemed that way, but this movie proves otherwise. What we have here is a mature film, with some funny moments, but instead of a stupid Carrey performance, we have a deep and moving performance, in a very strange and original, but nonetheless deep and moving picture. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) leads a fairly mundane and boring life until he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet). He and Clementine click right away despite their contrasting personalities. One day when visiting her and work, Joel finds she has no recollection of him, and discovers she had her memory erased of him from a clinic. Because of his depression over her, Joel decides to do the same thing. During the procedure, Joel realizes he wants to remember her, and must take her to places in his memory where she can't be erased. Meanwhile, during the operation at Joel's apartment, we meet the doctors working on him. Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) are the somewhat incompetent doctors, as they care about their own needs more than that of Joel, and Stan ends up inviting over Mary (Kirstin Dunst), the receptionist at their place of work. Joel jumps from memory to memory causing confusion by the younger doctors and a call to older Doctor Howard (Tom WIlkinsin) and secrets about the people performing the operations come out.For a movie that takes place mainly inside one guy's mind, this manages to be a very emotional film. Joel is a really likable character, and his progression throughout the film and in his memories is quite interesting. Kate Winslet plays a good opposite to Joel's introverted ways, and her performance as Clementine, and as merely a memory concocted by Joel is also excellent. All the performances are great, and what makes them great, is despite some stupidity even in the doctors, they're still portrayed as people, not just morons. They are just as deep as our protagonist, and have just as much baggage on the brain.The direction is phenomenal. The jump from memory to memory and the erasing of the memories gives us a huge feel of what Joel has gone through and takes us through all kind of interesting settings. In contrast, we have Joel's apartment where our co-plot is going on with the doctors, and the apartment in so many scenes gives a feeling of intimacy with the surroundings. The memories Joel has are so well done and even eerie at times, but also very sad and lonely when need be. Director Michael Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman really molded some brilliant contrasts, and some lovely and thought provoking characters.Overall, this really is destined to be a classic, or if not that a highly regarded cult classic. It's an emotional, beautiful movie, with Jim Carrey showing that he deserves more roles in dramas after pulling this off. Nothing's ever been quite like this, and chances are, nothing will again.My rating: **** out of ****. 108 mins. R for language and sexuality.\n",

For all those people out there that have given this film a good write up will you please explain to me what was actually good about this film. Nothing happened! I have always enjoyed Jim Carrey as an actor, but to choose to do this film I have to question him. His character was boring, dull and totally lifeless. Kate Winslet's so called American accent kept changing back to English!The concept of the film should have led to entertainment - instead it failed miserably and I found myself talking to friends during the film, as was everybody else in the cinema because this film is that bad!There is only one thing I ask - please can you invent the machine from the film and erase the 2 hours that I wasted yesterday!

      "Don't erase my memory. I want to remember this film so that I can remember to never see a film by Michel Gondry again. If it wasn't for the fact that this film was forced upon me on two occasions, I wouldn't have touched it with a barge pole. It is basically a story of a shy recluse called Joel (Jim Carrey) who meets lively and eccentric Clementine (Kate Winslet). They fall in love but their relationship is turbulent due to their contrasting personalities. Finally, an accident involving Clementine and Joel's car ends the relationship and Clem goes to have her memory of their relationship erased. She says during the interview before the erasure that she wants to erase Joel because 'he's boring'. In an act of spiteful revenge, Joel decides to erase Clementine as well. It is during the erasure process that he finds out that he actually wants to keep his memories as there were some moments of the relationship which he treasured. In his mind, he contrives a agreeable Clementine who is eager to help him preserve the memory of them as a couple, which is very ironic as Clementine erased him first.The main part of the story concerns the ways in which Joel and his made-up Clementine try to preserve Joel's memory of the relationship. This is supposed to be a romantic comedy with touches of noir and sci-fi but where is the comedy? More importantly, where is the romance? There are very few laughs to be gotten out of this film and the characters seem more interested in sex than true love. All the tender moments in which they share a tete-a-tete take place during sex scenes. During the erasure, Joel once returns to his childhood self and Clem shows him her crotch to bring him back. If it was indeed true love that they had, then Joel wouldn't have been vengeful enough to erase Clem.The characters are hard to like as they are too flawed to offer any inspiration. Joel has serious social and communication problems while Clementine is unpredictable, irresponsible and uncouth. The writer seemed to have thought that giving them swear words to say added to their personality. The storyline is also hard to follow as it is not set in chronological order. The only time indicator is Clem's hair colour. The main idea of the film is that memories contribute to who we are and are therefore important and should not be tampered with. It also implies that without bad memories we will never feel very happy as we will not have the bad moments to compare with the good moments. The memory of films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind and the like makes me appreciate directors such as Ridley Scott, Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg much more.\n",

      "**** WARNING - SPOILERS ****** Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind IS the best movie in 2004. What could you expect when you have a movie written by Charlie Kaufman? OK I admit at first I wasn't so sure about it, being a movie written by C. Kaufman and not being directed by Spike Jonze, by now I'm glad he didn't, it wouldn't be the same I suppose...I won't go into details about the movie, I don't have to. I just have something to say for those who didn't like the movie: you're simply not intelligent people. Simple as that. I hate romantic comedies, I hate Kate and dislike Carrey, I avoid watching anything related to Elijah Wood, so this movie had everything to make me want to hate it. But I didn't, I loved it and it's my 4th favorite movie of all time now. And you know why? Because I like movies that make me think. I enjoy movies made for smart people, by people smarter than me. OK perhaps you guys prefer a more linear, straight forwarded, non-surprising \"american gladiators\" kind of plot. Well good for you, as 95% of films is made for people like you. But if you didn't like this movie, please... try to think a little harder.PS: I really think the ending should feature our main characters in the car, talking (before she puts on the tape), and things start to disappear from the car and their faces disappear, and you know they eventually got together and did it again.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine is neither the masterpiece that many people will have you believe nor is it awful as the backlashers claim. Once again Charlie Kaufman takes the kernel of a great idea and overloads it with his own obsessive personality. The idea of a couple fighting to retain beautiful memories of their past together while undergoing a memory erasure is ingenious. Kaufman definitely hits some poignant notes along the way (he's great at communicating the mundane pleasures and comforts of relationships), but Joel and Clementine's characters seem like mere sketches rather than fully developed people that the audience can care about. Joel in particular is maddening because he's the same schlubby protagonist that is in all of Kaufman's scripts: it's Charlie himself. The man is simply incapable of creating characters outside the bounds of his own personality. Also, the movie isn't as enjoyable as it should be. Though I wanted to see how it ended (even though I predicted the plot twist about 30 minutes into the movie), Kaufman denies the audience the pleasures of human connection with the characters in favor of convoluted, intricately distanced storytelling. The characters come across as rats in an experiment or pawns in a chess game or any other omniscient metaphor you can think of. And the subplot between the workers of Lunaca fits but in an unimaginative, convenient way. I must say that all of the performances were excellent (except Elijah Wood, but he didn't have much of a character anyway), particularly Winslet and Mark Ruffalo. Director Michel Gondry and his team of technicians give the movie an appropriately jittery, jagged rhythm and look. It feels like the work of a writer on anti-depressants and Valium filtered through the mind of a director on a 3-day caffeine binge. That's not necessarily a bad thing because without the energy and gimmickry that Gondry brings to the film, the emptiness of the conception would be all the more glaring. Don't believe the hype but don't discount the film altogether either. It seems that many people are discovering something profound in it. Self-doubt and emotional shallowness might be the new status quo.\n",

      "I finally watched 'Eternal Sunshine...' this weekend. What a piece of absolute, unadulterated CRAP!!! From beginning to end. I mean I have seen a lot of bad movies recently, but this has to rank as THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!! And this won the Oscar for best screenplay? God! The people in Hollyweed must all have their head up their collective rectums! Now, I hate Jim Carrey, but he was absolutely horrid in this, as was Kate Winslet. Did the director actually expect anyone to feel anything for these 2-dimensional stereotypes? And the director must have gone to 'hand-held' camera 101 to learn his craft. Talk about annoying! I want my 25 cents back!!! At least most of the other garbage I've watched recently was mildly entertaining, but this wasn't even that! Did anyone actually believe they were saying something significant about the human condition here? If so, go back and watch some Renoir or Bergman or De Sica or Kurosawa or just about any of the great directors. Even Ed Wood knew more about the human condition than the bozo who wrote this!\n",

Well, I had a look and damn what a disappointment. So this Clementine has Joel erased from her mind (first of all this is stupid, even if it COULD ever exist(the erasing thing), why not just call him and tell him that you don't want to see him anymore, problem solved), the next day Joel finds out and wants Clementine erased from his mind too. Then we get to see what goes on in Joel's mind during the procedure. To this point the movie isn't that bad. But then it starts to get bad. It just goes on and on and on about the same stupid things in Joel's mind, after a few minutes it just gets boring. Now i'm really not a guy who only likes the action part in movies but this is just like watching the same thing over and over again. Then at the end when you've spent about an hour watching the same stuff, it's like the day starts all over again with Clementine getting her toothbrush, and fighting with her new boyfriend. It's like groundhog day, starting all over again. At the end you ask yourself, what really happened, and you're left with a feeling of emptiness because this movie seems completely pointless. Just an advice: don't watch this movie.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is clearly inspired by the Surrealist style of Luis Bunuel, and in particular his film \"That Obscure Object of Desire.\" Unfortunately none of the wit and imagination of a Bunuel film is displayed here. Given the weak screenplay and uninspired direction it is no surprise that the actors put in such lackluster performances. The usually manic Jim Carrey looks like he phoned in his performance, and the End Credits appear as if the production team couldn't come up with anything better. David Lynch and the Coen Brothers needn't worry about competition from Charlie Kaufman in this genre. I have seen thousands of films as someone seriously into the art, and I can think of few as poorly done as this one. The many favorable reviews on this film are a mystery, and its place on the IMDb Top 250 List is a travesty. 0/5 Stars\n",

It does have an idea with so many clever compartments that audiences can unload their emotional baggage into it. And that may be enough to make it a critical hit but it will just tank at the box office. Without more depth and inspiration, all this cleverness ultimately goes down the drain. Critics are determined to give this film a high grade because they want to seem clever but the fact is that this film is just a strange mess and nothing deep at all.  Bizarre for bizarre sake because you really don't care about either one of these strange characters.\n",

      "This comment is to save those people who haven't seen it yet, from its false advertising... I have NO IDEA why this movie is rated #33 on IMDb! That just shows how weird people are. Maybe I wasn't all that interested in the characters and their interaction or development, but rather it was awkward, confusing, and such a waste. I didn't like the characters AT ALL, and there wasn't really any good chemistry between them. They were miserable together, and they ended it, and then they chose to give it another shot, even if it will be miserable again! Now, I give them the credit for going along for the ride - but relationships aren't supposed to be like that. There are actually good relationships out there, but this superficial world seeking for pleasure in temporal and destroying substances is indicative and portrayed in this movie. It's interesting that they needed alcohol to make things romantic, always. It shows a lot about their character, and the character of those people who loved the movie! I just couldn't wait for the movie to END! This movie is really terrible. It made me dizzy and confused. I had NO GOOD feelings come out of it, and felt I had wasted 2 hours of my life. It isn't entertaining, uplifting, or edifying AT ALL. Really, Don't Waste Your Time With This Movie.\n",

      "I looked forward with great anticipation for the DVD release of this movie that had received a 10 for 50% of it's viewer ratings - making it #37 on the all-time list. After having seen this drek, I'm wondering if we all saw the same film. It appears that lots of people are believing the Hollywood hype that, \"If you don't understand it it most be great\". Well believe me this isn't great; it isn't good; it's awful. Uneven direction, purposely choppy plot line and ssslllllooooowwwww (to the point of being boooooring) pace combine to make the one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I loved the idea behind the story and the acting was fair, but give me a break. This movie never comes together and certainly doesn't deserve to be rated any where near the company of \"Apocalypse Now\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" or \"The Pianist\". Save your money, don't rent this trash; don't even bother with it when it comes on regular TV.\n",

      "It appears that Charlie Kaufman is a one trick pony. While he poses an intriguing concept, he does nothing of value with it. For some reason, the \"ardent\" movie denizens who frequent this site were mesmerized by this stunt, much in the same way that they uniformly loved the sequence stunt employed in \"Mememto\".Please. Can some screenwriter take an interesting concept and then actually develop it into something worth watching. Instead of developing a story, Kaufman simply plays mind games by distracting his audience with disjointed scenes that make little sense. And this is called genius? A complex story can be quite enjoyable if the screenwriter actually takes the time to make a coherent story with a plausible ending such as in \"The Usual Suspects\".Sorry, before one bows at the feet of any filmmaker, you should demand more than a clever proposition. Otherwise, \"The Butterfly Effect\" should have won an Oscar.\n",

      "Yes, I realize that any review that isn't an unabashed love letter to this film is likely to get a \"No\" vote! :-) I hope you'll note that although I didn't love this film, I didn't hate it, either. Charlie Kaufman's script deserved its Oscar, the acting is top-notch, the emotions rang true, and the DVD's got loads of goodies -- it was the direction that I felt dragged the film down.If Philip K. Dick had written a romantic comedy, the result might have turned out like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. In this seriocomic SF love story, Jim Carrey proves again that he's not just another mugging face, and Charlie Kaufman proves that he's the master of surreal dramedy. Director Michel Gondry, however, proves that Spike Jonze is really the most suitable director for Kaufman's particular brand of daffiness.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are stunningly believable as dysfunctional couple Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Clem initially seems like a sexy free spirit with a roguish streak, but as their romance continues, Joel sees the dark side of Clem's impulsive nature: on her bad days, hard-drinking Clem is needy and temperamental. What's worse, she sees Joel's relentlessly low-key, emotionally walled-off nature as a rebuke to her recklessness. Mutual misery ensues.No wonder Clem finally consults Lacuna, a Manhattan company run by avuncular Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) that erases your memories of a bad relationship. Lacuna even sends postcards to clients' intimates telling them not to mention the erased ex again, as Joel discovers when he sees one in their mutual friend's mail. Heartbroken, he also opts for the Lacuna treatment. While the erasing process takes him through memories of life with Clem, we discover that, when Joel wasn't being passive and Clem wasn't drunkenly cracking up Joel's car at 3 AM, the couple also enjoyed many good times together. Joel's reluctant to forget these happy moments, and that's where the film gets phantasmagorical as reality, fantasy, and memory collide. Within the maze of Joel's mind, he and Clem (who's been panicking and feeling like she's \"disappearing\" as she's slowly wiped from Joel's brain, despite having already forgotten him) team up and try to hide in all kinds of memories she has no part of. The funniest of these is the scene in Joel's childhood home, as a shrunken-to-child-size Joel faces Clem as his mom's miniskirt-clad, go-go-booted neighbor.The details of Lacuna's workings are ...SUNSHINE's most consistently witty, entertaining bits. Lacuna looks like a typical busy doctor's office, with receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst at her most winsome and dimply) constantly scheduling appointments: \"Valentine's Day is our busiest time.\" Funny yet poignant details abound, such as the teary-eyed client loaded down with her dog's belongings, a crucial part of wiping away memories of a loved one. The actual procedure is performed by young computer techies Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood, leaving Frodo Baggins far behind) who erase the subjects' memories in their homes while they sleep. The techs act like a bunch of fun-loving but irresponsible babysitters, swilling the unsuspecting Joel's whiskey, smoking pot and having sex (with Mary, not each other :-) as he sleeps. But Patrick goes beyond mischievousness into unethicality: usually a strikeout with women, he's begun dating Clementine, having fallen in love with her while erasing her Joel memories. Patrick tries to take the expressway to her heart by wooing her with her discarded Joel mementos. Of course, he doesn't consider that since Joel's relationship with Clem went sour despite all those nice gifties, history just might repeat itself. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bigger payoff to the Patrick subplot; he just kind of disappears from the film as if *he* were erased. Of course, that may well be the point! :-) Director Gondry, who also directed Kaufman's HUMAN NATURE (2001), spends so much time cross-cutting, juggling the movie's timeline, and inexplicably staging certain scenes in darkness with only a flashlight rendering the characters' faces visible that instead of enhancing the storytelling, it's merely distracting. I kept getting the feeling Gondry didn't trust the story itself to keep moviegoers' attention -- ironic, since he shares story credit with Kaufman and artist Pierre Bismuth. Having said that, when the visuals work, they work wonderfully, like when our hero and heroine dash through Grand Central Station while commuters wink out of existence left and right.Refreshingly, the New York locations aren't the usual hip or glamorous places. Joel and Clementine live in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and their apartments look just like homes of college students or artistic types trying to inject Soho style into suburbia. The filmmakers also make splendid use of the stark beauty of Montauk beaches in winter.For Carrey fans seeking slapstick and belly laughs, ...SUNSHINE... may seem to drag on eternally; its humor is more in the rueful TRUMAN SHOW vein, shot through with Kaufman's trademark surrealism. If you want a love story that will make you laugh knowingly and think about the way people approach relationships, ...SUNSHINE... is worth seeing. Hopefully it will convince you that counseling is a better approach to your relationship problems than science-fiction gadgetry!\n",

      "Ten minutes into ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, it was clear that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has a limited bag of tricks. What was clever in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH the first time I saw it became pretentious during the second viewing and insufferable during the third viewing. ADAPTATION was a similarly too-clever pretentious exercise in modernist style with no substance. ETERNAL SUNSHINE mines the same vein, but this time around the results are about as substantial as cotton candy and as permanent as a fireworks display. Except for the cutesy plot device--which was refreshing decades ago when handled by the likes of a Godard or a Philip K. Dick or a Harold Pinter--the film is like a second-string Woody Allen project fed into a blender (or rewritten by Donald Barthelme). The \"insights\" about relationships in this film are, as one critic aptly described it, about as profound as those in a Hugh Grant movie. And as \"experimental\" as Kaufman may think he is being, the plot is as predictable as that of any b-movie, once one figures out the premise of the story (which the slowest audience member will do in about 20 minutes). And what's the point of the murky faux-cinema-verite visual style in many scenes? The three points out of ten I awarded this film are primarily for the actors, Jim Carrey in particular. When will the Hollywood establishment and the critics finally learn that Kaufman is a one-trick-pony? The emperor is not wearing any clothes here. As someone who has championed and supported TRUE avant-garde filmmaking for decades, I see this as a cheap Hollywood pastiche of the avant garde. Those who found John Sayles' LONE STAR to be \"multi-layered\" instead of cliche-ridden will find much to praise and discuss in ETERNAL SUNSHINE. While Kaufman is not as bad as P.T. Anderson (at least Mr. Kaufman manages to honor traditional story structures while re-fashioning them, and at least he can create REAL if shallow characters, something Anderson hasn't learned to do), my evening would have been better spent watching a straight-to-video action film or some obsscure 1950s Allied Artists post-noir crime film. Rent this one...or better yet, rent something else!\n",

      "Yikes. I had to struggle to make it through this ridiculously overpraised film - REALLY overpraised in IMDb-land - it seems like all of Andy Dufresne's (\"Shawshank Redemption\") lil' pals have found a new place to languish their misplaced emotions. After being knocked out by \"Being John Malkovich\", \"Human Nature\", and \"Adaption\", I expected more of the same here. Instead, I learned a lot about Charlie Kaufman.What did I learn? Well, this is the first time I've seen Charlie work with a blank slate. In other words, the storyline that Charlie wrote is too weak to carry the movie (unlike the aforementioned Charlie masterpieces). And without a good story, it's a whole 'nother world out there for Charlie. What we're talking about is a peek-a-boo variation on the old \"amnesia\" plot line that really feels more like a turn on \"Donovan's Brain\". And so, unfortunately, there's almost immediately not much left to do except to send the characters into action. Running from here to there and back again in an ever changing universe is a favorite Kaufman underpinning that has really provided momentum to his hit movies, particularly \"Being John Malkovich\" (an absolute gem of a film). But without a substantive plot to grab onto, the panache of eye-grabbing images and set pieces that should really light up all of that running feels empty, strident, and worst of all, manipulative.I also learned that when Charlie doesn't have much going in the way of the ideas, the quirky neuroses that propel most of his characters move from background to foreground. And that isn't good - unfortunately, it's downright overbearing, and ultimately numbing. And in this film, the characters, as thin as tissue paper, are also held at arm's length from the viewer. This isn't the Charlie that I've known and loved - I just didn't care about these characters! Charlie does make a misguided attempt to deconstruct Joel's life, but who the heck really knows anything about Joel? The movie is competently handled by Michel Gondry, but he's at Charlie's mercy. The actors. Jim Carrey? He's surprisingly weak in a role that would seem to cater to his style. Unfortunately, Carrey underplays the role (!) early on and then has to get out of control later to catch up. Talk about episodic - he seems confused as he runs from here to there, with or without his ski cap. This may be the worst performance that I've seen from Tom Wilkinson, but he's working with cardboard. And Kirsten Dunst? She's still trying to prove that she can act..in ANY role.Looking for bright spots? There's Kate Winslet. Her blistering performance deserves the Oscar nomination that she received. She really does her best to elevate this leaden film. Superb art direction, set direction, and editing are also Oscar-worthy.But ultimately, I learned that Charlie has to have all cylinders firing or absolutely nothing works for me (as opposed to a LOT of other people). At its best, \"Eternal Sunshine\" is a mildly interesting mess, and no one has a lot with which to work. But if you've seen much of his other work, you know that he's failed here.And despite all of the jawing about Montauk, the bulk of the story seems to be set in Rockville Centre on Long Island. Funny, I always thought of Rockville Centre as a bit upper-crust. How the mighty have fallen.And the same can be said about Charlie. Hopefully, this is a low point for him, though I miss \"Ned and Stacey\". About a 3.5 out of 10.\n",

      "I was expecting something more from it¬Ö",
      " With such high rate here on IMDb, some promising plot keywords (as \"amnesia\", \"erased memory\" or \"surreal\") and great cast as it has, I was certainly expecting something much better! The main idea, in spite of not being bad, is not completely original and the way the plot was developed was not the best. I think it turned too much melancholic, repetitive, and too centred in this night of the \"erasing memory\" process¬Ö",
      " The \"surrealism\" of this movie can only be connected to the mentioned process itself or to some weird settings that appear in some scenes of the film, since I don't think it's a \"traditional surreal\" story. And the plot is not so non-linear either. It's pretty understandable indeed.As positive features I will refer the cinematography (there are really good settings in this film, and the idea of the things start to disappearing around him while his memory was being erased was also pretty nice) and the acting, which is not bad either. Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst were very hot in this film! The soundtrack I didn't appreciate too. I think it's too poor and sometimes it's just too weird, on a bad way¬Ö",

      "Sunshine was one of those cinema films, credited as a story about love i got dragged along by the girlfriend. At the time I enjoyed the sci-fi aspect of it. I found the writing and idea to be interesting on a purely inventive level. A very original concept which I found as more of a good story at the time. I appreciated the acting, particularly the way Carrey portrayed his character. People don't always give him the respect that his abilities deserve, they see him as a funny man, but their are films like this and The Truman Show where he manages to capture an emotion which he might not be so related to.I watched the film again on DVD of late, and things that happened to me related to the film, which cast it in a totally different light. I could suddenly understand the idea of removing somebody from your mind, the physical act of it didn't sound like a clever Sci-Fi idea, but something that should be able to be done. In the same way, I also understood the concept of running from the removal. It related to me because I found that I didn't want to forget things, and wanted to forget others.I think this film has several different effects on people. Those with histories in relationships will feel a lot more connected with the film, it speaks to people who still feel the effects of their own relationships. To others, who cant feel this connection, it becomes much more of a typical film, nothing really to relate to, no compelling characters, no huge action or uncomplicated story lines. The viewer can just see it, but not really care. This leaves them thinking less of such a film.I think the only way people can really appreciate this film is to see themselves in it, pick a person who they are like, and understand how they would react in such a situation. I believe that this film is much better when you see your own mind and memories, and begin to feel the story.\n",

Yes if you want to watch a film that takes 2 hours or so to tell you what I can explain in one sentence then this is for you. It is painful to watch and tries but fails to be edgy. Watch it and you too will want to erase your memory of this bore-fest.\n",

      "I belong to the same group as Woody Allen and Nietzsche. I wouldn't want to belong to a club that would have me in it. This attitude pervades my life. It includes clubs, relationships, and movies among other things probably. For example, I hesitated to give this, my most favorite movie in the world four stars. I thought, since it is an enjoyable movie, one I enjoyed, I can't give it four stars. I wanted to give it three and a half. But I just watched it for maybe the twentieth time, and I absolutely had to give it four stars.Four stars does not mean it is perfect. This film is not perfect. I can't describe many movies as perfect. But there are many flawless parts of this movie.Let me start over with the recapitulation. This movie starts with Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) writing abysmally about Valentine's Day on a snowy beach after he skips work for no reason and falling in love with a woman he has just seen. Oddly, she introduces herself to him, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), and though she is immediately strange and exotic and Joel is introverted and boring, they hit it off immediately. For the first twenty minutes. And then there's a snapback. You're ripped from the plot and you realize that you haven't seen the opening credits yet, and you watch them as Joel sobs in his car.And the movie starts in on this crazy plot with purposeful amnesia, love, and all sorts of other human things.This is a Charlie Kaufman movie, and if you don't know what that means, then you don't know indie movies (but that's okay. Just make sure you get to know Kaufman). He is a crazy, insane genius screenwriter (see Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche, New York) and his mind is a wonderland. Michel Gondry is a French genius, a director who doesn't seem to direct, but lives within the movie (see The Science of Sleep, Be Kind, Rewind). Both of them are perfect in the film, and it is great that they were the two to make the commentary on the DVD.Kate Winslet gives the performance of her life in this movie. She disappears. Clementine takes over. There is no trace of Kate Winslet, or Rose from Titanic, or Marianne from Sense and Sensibility. She is fantastic. I cannot praise her performance in this movie enough. Jim Carrey also disappears. You forget Ace Ventura and every movie he ever made. This is his best performance ever. The other \"stars\" of the movie in its subplot are Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo. They are all amazing, with perhaps the exception of Mark Ruffalo, who is simply fitting. But even he fit wonderfully. (Side note: This movie features my favorite actor and actress, Tom Wilkinson and Kate Winslet)This movie is affecting. That's it. Affecting. It's modern. It takes place NOW, although it could take place anytime. But it's odd for great movies to take place NOW. So often they are placed in another place or time, but this movie is here and now, in your face, so relevant, and it has the feel that it could never be irrelevant. The effects are sparse and perfect when the come, subtle, and helpful, but not a focus at all, the way they are supposed to be.The music is quite good an fits well. It is quirky and playful in a movie that is often just that.More than anything, this movie is a good friend. After seeing this for the twentieth time or so, I can quote nearly every line. I can laugh. I couldn't laugh at it the first time. Now it is hilarious, a real situational comedy. Yet, it is more touching each time. It's like a fine wine that only gets better with age.I would recommend this movie to anyone. Children, old people. Young people in new relationships, old people who have been married fifty years. Everyone.\n",

Granted, \"Malkovich\" was a decent movie, but not out of this world by any means, in fact, it was mildly entertaining at best. But ESOTSM is just plain dull. For \"Highly Original\" read Boring, for \"ingenious\" read pretentious.

That is, the whole movie seems to build upon the internal conflict that the main character feels once the memories of his former girl friend starts to vanish. However, it's like watching a movie where someone's trying to get rid of her love for Hitler. I feel zero conflict.For the record, I've seen this movie five times.

The camera constantly shook, making it difficult to watch without getting sick to my stomach.  It reminded me of the Blair Witch Project - which at least was interesting aside from the camera shaking.2.  All of the characters were unlikable.  I couldn't care less about any of them.3.  There was no plot or purpose.  Okay, I understood the premise of erasing memories and Joel's desire to hold onto the memories after committing to have them erased.  But why all of the pointless, disjointed scenes?  One after another. Pointless, meaningless snippets of their lives together. Who cares?  Over and over and over until I felt like screaming, `Enough already! Get on with it!'  There was no mystery or anticipation of something about to happen.4.  Weird new subplots were constantly added that only confused this confusing mess even further.About 3/4 of the way through the movie, I turned to my wife and said, `What do you think?'  Her response was, `This is the worst movie I've ever watched.'  We walked out of the theatre glad to be out of there.  I couldn't care less about missing the ending because, in our view, there was no story. This was only the second movie I've ever walked out on.The whole thing seemed like a bad drug trip.

Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have no chemistry, and most of the characters' performances are flat and unconvincing, as if they can't believe they're acting this crap out either. Not to mention the nonsensical, confusing plot, and how aesthetically unpleasant most of the film is. I couldn't recommend this movie less; without a doubt, one of the worst I have ever seen. If only they could purge my memory of having seen it.\n",

      "This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It starts off great with the main character (Jim Carrey) meeting a mysterious girl (Kate Winslet) on a beach. They then go to her house for her to pick up her toothbrush. During this part the lighting is nice, the characters look interesting and the whole atmosphere is pleasant. The film starts going wrong after that. OK so the story is that in fact the 2 characters knew each other before that scene (they were dating) but had fallen out and had voluntarily gone through a (very far-fetched) memory erasing program (so as to forget about each other). So that scene is the first where they meet after having forgotten about each other (we only find that out much later) and they fall in love again.As you can see the full plot holds in about 4 lines. Not enough for a 2 hour long film might you think. How right you are! What makes the film even worse is that in order to try to hide this evident lack of story the director has tried to tell it (the story) in a \"clever\" way by filming the main character's (Jim Carrey's) thoughts and memories. The result is a huge boring mess. In some ways the complicated narrative made me think of Pulp Fiction in the way that it mixes past and present and that you can only really put it all together at the end. The main difference being that in Pulp Fiction there were about 10000 ideas (storywise) while here there is only 1. And this 1 idea just drags on and on and on during the whole film.Negative aspects of the film: Lack of any interesting story (already mentioned previously). The darkness of the pictures, apart from the first scene all the film is very very dark (mostly because it's supposed to be taking place at night). This makes the film very sad and depressing, it feels like a bad dream. Lack of any humor, the film could have been made better by a few jokes but there are hardly any amusing scenes. Jim Carrey playing a kid, the scenes where Jim Carrey plays himself as a boy just look ridiculous. They don't work. Although these scenes might have looked OK on paper they don't work in the film.Positive aspects of the film: The actors are good (especially Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey), but is it really positive to think that their talent has been wasted in such a bad film?\n",

Did the filmmakers set out to induce headache and nausea? The story, the lighting, the camera-work, the editing--they really made me seasick. And it's hard to care about characters who don't like themselves enough to engage in basic grooming. What in the world was romantic about this story of abuse, alcoholism, relationship addiction, and depravity? There was no compassion for the obvious sickness of the characters. Uck, uck, uck.

The ending was the silliest thing I've ever witnessed. Anyone who says this is a good movie must either be getting paid or else is trying to impress someone. No one, and I mean no one, who enjoys movies could find a single redeeming quality in this bomb.This is another case of the race some directors are having to see who makes the craziest movie ever,for which they think they've made a \"Masterpiece\"\n",

      "Just got back from the theater and I liked it a lot. But then again, I just like moving images. It reminded me not so much of John Malkovich or Memento (to both of which it bears some resemblance), but rather of Lost In Translation.(note: for a short resume of it all, see bottom)Why? Only a very small part of the message was the same (when and how do we burn down our bridges), although tackled here in a different way. In Translation the whole point was that you don't always have to burn down your bridges (life follows the course it has to follow), while this one says the same in a less subtle way, by, instead of looking at the \"standing at the precipice\"-moment of decision (like LiT did), going beyond the decision point and saying \"see whY you shouldn't? there's the good stuff!\" and ultimately also ending up saying the river flows the way it should flow. Still, plus.But the general atmosphere was fairly similar, and that's what did it for me - yep, sometimes just the atmosphere, sound dumb I know. This lukewarm melancholy that comes over you for example when you remember when you were little the first time a girl did something to you that made you understand - for the very first time - that you were something special in someone else's life. It's the whole melancholy that gets built up by focusing on the Good Stuff while sh*t is happening. LiT however does a very neat trick in looking for solid ground in finding a different way of being Here and Now and Self; Spotless Mind's message is on the Good in Memories. The whole memory stuff is my thing. I love it. I see it in every film (mainly because I try to see many films about it). So that's another plus.So the minus? Well, I had the impression the script got messed around with, and now that I've read some of the trivia here I'm sure it was. A) The tone isn't balanced at all. People DON'T go see this thinking it is a comedy - because it isn't (Lost In Translation made the same error selling itself as one). It has some fun moments that successfully counter the melancholy, but the moments are scattershot. The start is good, because confusing and suddenly gripping. But the whole sequence where they begin to erase his memory and the erasers get stoned is boring and pointless (except for seeing Kirsten Dunst in underwear) and serves to hide the fact that the main story doesn't have a lot to go on (i.e., the memory erasing itself is kinda nifty the first time, but...) B) The point they're trying to make is diffuse. When Patrick uses Joel's lines to get to Clementine (another useless side plot) you get this naive \"it's not about the right words, but about the right person\" idea. They try to tell us we should learn to live with painful memories; at the same time, there's the idea of making a relationship work if you keep focusing on the good stuff; there's the idea that the same stuff always happens (though they toned that down in the final script version... which may just not have been the thing to do); etc.The bottom line here: they should've decided on which point to make, what tone to go for, so or make it more of a comedy, or, my option, cut the annoying bits, and focus on the role of memory in social life and the actual NAture of the relationship between a very good Carrey, and an, as always ab-so-lu-te-ly FAbulous Kate Winslet (people, she is GRAND). As it is now, while nice (yes, that word) with some wonderful moments, and nibbling at some great topics, you still get the nagging feeling you've been watching the exposition of a gimmick, rather that the wonderful film it could have been.The Beck cover song rules!\n",

      "'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' has an unnecessarily long title and is way too strange and convoluted to take seriously. It is understandable to show a story told from a different perspective, but a filmmaker has to set limits. It makes no sense in trying to confuse the audience as much as you can. That does not make the film intelligent or original. 'Eternal Sunshine..' is too full of itself; it says, 'look how creative I am, telling this story in such an odd way. I dare you to figure it out'. Nobody will gain anything if the filmmakers are trying to make the audience look stupid. It only creates an exaggerated ego for those who do understand it. The story is about two lovers who decide to erase the memory of each other. When they are erased from each other's memory, they find themselves drawn back to each other by sheer chance. I think one point the film is trying to make is that true love is a destiny. Two people are drawn to each other because there is something greater is at work, bringing lovers together. Fantastic idea, but it can be told in much simpler ways than done in this movie. The idea shouldn't be expressed in the over-the-top way that it was done in 'Eternal Sunshine..'. Good performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, an unlikely pair bringing chemistry to the screen, but even they couldn't save this jumbled mess.\n",

      "Saw this last night and it is pretty nigh unwatchable.  We kept debating whether to walk out but stayed in the bleak hope that there might be one small gram of redeeming humor or insight in the entire 2 hours.  Where do I begin to dissect this abortion of a movie?  The characters that Carey and Winslett play are both visually disgusting (everyone in this movie badly needs a bath and a wardrobe that has not been acquired primarily from dumpsters), and are whiney, and utterly annoying creations.  Carey is dull, lifeless, totally uninspired and looks physically ill.  He NEEDS to go back to the comedies for which he has a true gift rather than making these dreadful \"artistic\" movies.  Winslett's character is obviously insane, and if I were a man to whom she made advances I would flee in horror.   The \"impulsiveness\" she attributes to herself would obviously be the hallmarks of several major mental illnesses in real life.  When you put these two together, the only party who could gain any advantage from the match would be a manufacturer for razor blades. The desire to erase either of these grungy losers from one's mind would be only natural and logical. The movie simply makes no sense - the \"plot\" is extremely difficult to follow as the movie jumps back and forth with no apparent logic or design.  The effect is jarring and nerve-wracking.  There is no apparent editing, which might have created the semblance of a cohesive narrative.  There is no apparent script -the characters look like they are manufacturing their assorted incoherent rantings and mumblings on the spot.  As for direction - I think the only direction this movie needed ultimately was the sign directing us to the EXIT.\n",

      "If it wasn't for Carrey this film would be straight to video. A feeble attempt to do the \"flashback\" genre so wonderfully mastered by Tarantino and it fails in every respect. The viewer is left wondering what on earth is going on. what time period id this piece from? By the time you've worked it out the next one has cut in, or we're back to the present day - or are we? Its being clever for being clever's sake.Slow to get going it meanders about with little character development at all. Gets better at the end but by then I was past caring.Easily the worst film to come out since the mind-numbingly awful \"Lost in Translation\".\n",

      "The premise was intriguing and it offered plenty of viable developments. Unfortunately we get treated to a somewhat predictable \"the beginning is the end, the end is the beginning\" circular flashback story arch, already seen in Memento (now that was a great movie) and Irreversible, just to name a few.Things start to go south, fast, as soon as the whole erasing process, something that is supposed to be very advanced procedure, is treated and handled with the same secrecy, care and professionalism college students put into cleaning porn-infected computers... A half-assed side-activity than can be performed everywhere, while doing something more fun in the meantime. Seriously, such a life-altering procedure is performed at the patient's place by two creepy guys? And the security of the records is so sloppy a receptionist can go ahead and mail them to the patient who are supposed to forget about the whole thing?That's simply preposterous, a poorly thought-out \"deus ex machina\" that has no place in an alleged cinematic masterpiece.Not to mention the outcome of the whole love story... Despite finding out they had already met, loved and erased each other, Joel and Clementine STILL decide to give themselves another chance.I don't know about you, but I wouldn't really get into a relationship with a girl who thinks I'm a wimpy and boring loser who'll made her loathe herself after a while. Nor I would like to date a girl who I find obnoxious, sad and a bit slutty too.Does the movie try to convey (shove down our throats rather..) a message of hope? Or is it just hopeless stubbornness? A faux \"happy ending\" just because it would have been rude sending the audience home without some sort of closure?Joel and Clementine basically wasted two years of their life... we got away with losing just two hours... Unfortunately we can remember the movie. So it's debatable who drew the shortest straw here ;)\"Eternal Sunshine\" is the typical intellectualoid movie, with a good, but underdeveloped, idea behind it but also with too much quirkiness to actually work. Visually it's pleasant and well done, capturing the disorientation induced by the dreamy sequences, acting is OK...Cinematically it's \"spotless\", but as for the story arch it's definitely \"plotless\".\n",

      "I have just dragged back from a friend's home after suffering thru this \"Eternal Monsoon of the Addlepated Cerebellum.\" I feel goofy from watching it. You don't so much watch it as suffer through it. Perhaps this is the vogue nowadays to have jerky sequences signifying nothing much at all but a morass of frenetic activity pass as avant-garde film-making, but it's lost on me. I read a review by a famous Chicago reviewer who claims there's emotional involvement of the viewer with the main characters. Well, not with my friend and me. We were put off by these two sad cases - Jim Carrey a subdued and lonely, rather conservative man, and Kate Winslet as a hoyden given to obscuring her beauteous charms under flagrantly dyed hair ranging in shades of Day Glo orange to Mood Indigo Blue. What a waste of this fine actress. The only good thing I saw was the welcome tamping down of Carrey's normal ebullience to a rather more approachable and assimilable sort of male creature, albeit shot through with insecurities and given to impulses only made understandable by watching the flick through. But who wants or needs to see what happens to either of these (again let me use the adjective)GOOFY characters? Not we! I chose this film on the basis of the awards it has both been nominated for and has garnered, the crown jewel being Winslet's nomination for the Academy Award! Who nominated her for this schlock? I rather think she should put a bag over her head! Try to hide this one from her resume! What is to be happy about in a role so chaotic and obscure? I know nothing about this flighty, maddening woman, having watched this film! Who would want to hitch their wagon to Winslet in this movie? A lunatic! I would like Lacuna Corp. to erase the memory of having seen this film from my brain, even with the threat of the Lacuna employees bouncing on either side of me on my bed of tortured electrodes while they clean house and do a clean sweep of my cranium! These tormented employees seem to be full of frantic actions as well as the crazed \"heroine.\" Kirsten Dunst proves she has not an ounce of fat as she hops about prior to copulation with wild-haired Mark Ruffalo and then, unsated, begins an immediate seduction of her boss, the grand suave Doctor of this mad Lacuna outfit. What a GOOFY group these people make and what a dingbat dunce-cap of a movie they inhabit! I am loony from watching it and I am going to bed now and try to sleep it off. I hope I don't have flashbacks! Oh, welcome Senility! I want no short-term memory of this wild, manic, episodic Endurance Contest to darken my dreams!\n",

      "The movie made its point well enough. Sometimes in the midsts of arguments and problems, you forget the wonderful things you have. But understanding this movie did not help me to like it.The movie was very slow-moving. It was over seventeen minutes before the credits started rolling. I did not like any of the characters very much, although I did feel for them. Life can be painful. But is it truly worth eliminating everything associated with someone (or even a pet) to get rid of the bad? As the plot progressed, I felt an increasing desire to turn it off and leave. I had already decided for myself on the point the movie made, so to me it was a sad story that I would rather not ever think about again.\n",

A boring man with no interest, no passion (according to the female lead), and an alcoholic woman who sleeps around to feel wanted, just don't belong together. In fact, they probably don't belong with anyone. The movie trying so hard to convince us that they should be together is just failing miserably.Also, what kind of man in his right mind would give up Kirsten Dunst for a woman twice her age anyway.Finally, no clinical operation with that kind of life-changing impact would be executed at the patient's home!!!

I found it rather difficult to believe that this team of so called Brain technicians, were operating out of some filthy sloppy apartment, wherein Jim Carrey is laid out on a bed, where people are jumping all over, and running about the room.The story became so involved, with crazy sub plots, it became so convoluted, neither my husband or I knew ,what the heck was going on.Unless you are a die hard Jim Carrey fan, I wouldn't recommend this movie.

      "I've been a Kaufman fan since he was writing for television, and was blown away by Malkovich, like most everyone was. It's truly shocking this movie is 200 places higher rated than either Malkovich or Adaptation among IMDb users (#35 on the top 250, compared to #208 and #235 respectively). I thought this movie was great, though not as inventive as his prior work. Actually, this movie is probably the most conventional movie Kaufman's written besides \"Confessions\".Also, a shout out to those who think Spike Jones directed this, actually Michel Gondry did. Gondry has given us better crafted movie than Spike Jones has with Kaufman's scripts. This movie's full of fun visual gags. Still, I'd love to see what how Kaufman's scripts panned out if he ever paired up with a director that didn't come from the music video generation. As far as performances go, the best aspect of this movie is Kate Winslet. The character that Kaufman gave her is spectacular, and she is awesome as usual. Carrey's character just mopes a lot. In the end, Carrey's performance in this movie is nowhere near his performance in.... ta-da... Cable Guy. Cable Guy is his best and most underrated work. Carrey was born to do goofy faces and over the top characters, why not appreciate the movies where he's at the top of his game? It's not exactly a subtle performance, but since when is subtle always better? Would we ask the Three Stooges to do Hamlet?\n",

      "Don't you all get angry at me but I have to admit that this movie was an absolute failure. It seemed interesting in the trailers and the reviews praised and I went to see it. How wrong were both of those. I left the movie in disgust at how I wasted ten dollars on it. I thought that the casting was inept and that the storyline was trite and iffy. None of the Actors were Oscar-Quality. There were so many other great films than this including Ray, The Aviator, Sideways, etc. And don't any of you say that I don't get \"this movie\" since I saw it once in the theatres and watched it twice on DVD when I borrowed it from a friend. My opinion never faltered.Addition: This movie is on the Top 250? It's friggin number 36 beating out the unbelievable Taxi Driver in number 37. This film has absolutely no reason to be here on this list. It is taking up spots that rightly belong to Network, which is one of the greatest written satire films starring some the greatest actors, three of which won Oscars specifically for the film. Shame on all of you for liking this film.Addition 2: Finally, an update, with glee to finally see this movie sink below Taxi Driver as it should. I am happy to see a classic work of art beat this contrived load of bull-hooey that receives so much attention since it's so arty... go see Brick if you want an arty and awesome movie.\n",

      "It is hard for me to relate my opinions of this film to you because it sucked so much that I tried to erase it from my mind (quite unlike the goal of the lead character who was struggling to retain his memories). I think the acting was fine and that Jim Carey is a great actor, but, unfortunately, the movie was just so boring. Also, I do not think there is anything novel about the idea of erasing one's memories of a person to try to make your life easier for you after a breakup, or trying to recapture these memories once you realize you love them (the action flick total recall, and I'm sure, a bunch of other flicks have such concepts). This movie is just a sappy love story that is way too psychedelic for my tastes. The weirdness of it all and the constant frenzy to retain memories and the weird special effects actually gets annoying after awhile and detracts away from the central theme of love in the film because it is too mind distorting. In short, this film is good for sappy artsy fartsy people who enjoy commenting about how unique something is, when really; it's not that original and actually gives you a psychedelic headache.\n",

      "The premise is intriguing. Girl gets tired of a declining relationship and has all memory of boyfriend erased. Boyfriend finds out and decides he can't live with that: gets himself erased as well. In the middle of the procedure, which he experiences as a kind of dream, he becomes lucid, realizes what's going on and decides he doesn't want this to happen. But it's too late; despite all his efforts his memory is erased. Fate in the shape of an accidental post- erasure meeting and the other actions of other characters involved twists the plot around and brings them together again.The cast: a director's dream. Jim Carrey, Kate Winslett, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo. How can you go wrong? Well, you can, and something did. I've been trying to work out what, because there are so many factors that nuked this movie.First of all what went right: Carrey and the rest of the cast were amazing, even if most of them never got a chance to actually evince what you might call 'depth of character'. Carrey and Winslett do get that chance in the first part, where 'Joel' and 'Clementine' meet again, and those few minutes alone make the movie worth watching; after that it's mostly downhill: the story falls apart in the same way that 'Being John Malkovic' ultimately does, except that here at least the story has somewhere to go, though the writer, director and editor seem to have no idea about how to get there, but ultimately fumble themselves through to an ending.There were some elements with incredible potential: for example the whole dream-like erasure process, with the built-in flashes of lucidity, followed by lapses back into non- awareness. Anybody who's had lucid dreams will recognize the process. Then there's what amounts to a mental chase and battle of wits, as Joel tries to hide his memories in places where the hi-tech backed pursuit cannot find it. The whole thing throws up a whole plethora of troublesome questions related to cognitive research and philosophy, and especially the nature of 'identity'. The suffocating predicament Joel got himself into (by surrendering control of his mind to someone else) and can't get himself our of. The twists and turns of contingency as, despite all this, it all appears to turn out all right.The flaw at the heart of this movie is that someone forgot what story to tell, and instead tried to tell too many, and in the process the movie lost its soul. The editing completed the job that the directing started. It was so VISIBLE as to become detrimental to the actors: in its contrived cleverness it erased much of the depth they could have brought to the characters. Sometimes I had the feeling that there actually WAS something more to this moment or that; but then it usually got zapped, as if the editor was chasing that precious something down like Stan was doing to Joel's memories.The cinematography was trying to be so clever that one could almost touch it. In conjunction with the awful editing, almost every 'cut-to' became a painful jarring of this viewer's attempt to relate to the story and the characters, and made the thing into a cinematographic, rather than an emotional experience.Without this, maybe the other problems of the movie would have been non-existent. I don't know, because the movie is as it is, and we can play 'what if' games forever and speculate into a vacuum. But I'd like to think that maybe in the hands of someone less keen to 'make a movie' and more interested in people and telling a story, we might actually have some emotional understanding of why Joel and Clementine needed to be together, and why it was right that in the end they were. Don't misunderstand me: give me ANY reason for an upbeat ending and I'll embrace it joyfully. So why, in this instance, did I feel that the ending was tacked-on, contrived, artificial? The back-together-despite-all-the-odds simply rings false, if only because the only reason why they are is contingency, sheer dumb luck, twists of fate. They get a second chance and maybe they'll work it out this time. But did they do anything to earn it? In particular, did Clementine, who evinces no sign of actually thinking that there was something wrong with her method to opt out of a situation with the minimum of pain? Do these people actually love each other, and if they do, is that love enough or shown as even indicatively sufficient to bridge the gap they've created in their past and through their actions of surrendering their power of their minds to someone else?Finally, there is something offensive about the general attitude by director and editor towards the actors: in this case a dream-cast, whose potential was mostly edited out of existence. There is a school of film-makers who see actors as a kind of cinematographic element, like a piece of landscape or a prop. As long as they perform the correct motions and say the right things at some time or during some take, there's probably a way to edit it together so that it looks right. That's OK if the actors actually need such treatment. There is another school who believes that actors are to be considered not just essential, but next to the director the dominant visible participants in any decent story-telling process. To demean them into becoming just pieces in a mosaic of self-important film-making is degrading. That Carrey, Winslett and the rest of the cast still manage to shine is a testimony to their professionalism and consummate skill. That aspect was the one truly bright spark in an otherwise disappointing flick.Till Noever, Author: KEAEN, www.owlglass.com10/10 for the actors 2/10 for the film-maker/editor\n",

And yes the Script must have been conducted by 10 year old under the space of 10 minutes as part of their homework. I tried to picture this film as realistically as I could but with no such luck. It is not about the fact that that the film was unsuccessful because of is it was not real, it was the script that delivered half answers and intriguing mystery with a romance that failed to convince people at the end, as the combined acting and romance seemed to fail everything with film industry. the only part that seemed convincing was Jim Carrey's despair but his acting alone could not support this film Seriously try and AVOID this film at all costs. a -10 out of 10\n",

      "What started out as an interesting movie idea to me became a struggle to watch until its completion. Kate Winslet plays kind of a freaky girl - quite a departure from what you're used to if you saw her in Titanic or Sense and Sensibility. Jim Carrey plays a very dark depressed and sad individual - even sadder than the role he played in Cable Guy. The movie is hard to follow, starting out at what you think is the beginning, only to be shifted and twisted down a disjointed and confusing path. You really don't get the feeling that the two main characters have any chemistry between them at all. In order to enjoy a movie, you really have to care about the main characters and what happens to them. Carrey's character comes off as desperate and sad and Kate Winslet's character comes off like a crazy witch with a capital B - I started not to care whether they got back together or not within minutes of watching. Suffice it to say, this is a good movie if you rent it and drop acid before watching - other then that it must be avoided...\n",

After 15 minutes of agony, I was hitting the FF button. After 45 minutes, I had to turn it off. that almost never happens. I have not seen the second half, and probably never will.I'm not trashing this movie to be cute, or to go against the crowd, I really think it's a smarmy, cutesy, clich√©d and pretentious piece of fluff.

I should have listened to my gut. This meandering and boring film moves so slowly that it feels like an eternity. Jim Carrey looks lost as he tries to actually act without goofing off. It does not work. There is very little to keep your attention. The plot is paper thin and the premise could have been handled in 30 minutes to an hour. Characters seem like cutouts without any cardboard backing.The only joke in this movie is that people have been led to believe it is any good.

This time 3 local film critics all rated Eternal Spotless whatever as one of the best films in 2004, so I decided to view it. I shouldn't have bothered. This was one of the four worst films I have ever seen (the others being Memento, The Piano, and that precocious pretentious thing about losing a guy in 14 days). I notice the DVD cover had this film in the Comedy genre.

      "The idea of two peculiar and out of the ordinary persons, falling in love with each other, and then suffering a breakup that causes both of them to get the other erased from their memories: is actually not half bad.Unfortunately there are a few things that steal too much focus, like:The part of the story regarding Stan & Mary getting wasted while dancing around in Joel's bedroom, is absolutely useless, and doesn't add anything to the story. Actually the entire sub-plot about the two are completely out of place in a movie like this, and I would have liked a more elaborate story of Joel or Clementine, instead of adding this piece of \"teenage stoner comedy\".The second sub-plot about Mary & Dr. Mierzwiak does at least affect the story, but it still doesn't feel like it's actually changing anything.I know many people are having trouble accepting Jim Carrey as a serious actor, myself included. Well I watched \"The Number 23\" from 2007, where he played the obsessed Walter, a role I believe he did quite well; Unfortunately by 2004(Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind) he was not yet at that level, and I would rate his performance as mediocre at best.But despise what other reviews might say; I believe Kate Winslet played her role really well! I can feel the sub-plots annoys me though, perhaps also more than they should; but they rip apart what could have been a beautiful story and keeps me guessing at what kind of genre this is? A Serious drama, or a forgettable comedy.\n",

      "This movie tries to be \"quirky\" because it's a romance with two crazy people. The problem is that these people are so nuts that they don't need to date each other, they need case workers.Look, I can identify with Jim Carrey's character. I like to sketch weird drawings that don't make sense to anyone, and I'm not the smoothest operator in life. But this guy is so retarded that it's irresponsible to present him as a potential date for ANY chick. He sits cross-legged on the ground in public drawing in his sketchpad, he dresses like a damned fifteen year old girl with Aspergers syndrome, and he lives in his own world. He doesn't need a girlfriend, he needs someone to teach him that some of his behaviors are not helping him in life at all. Like a \"big brother\" for adults. The script should have known that.Winslet's character is a wolf in sheep's clothing, a damaged slut who would not just quickly tire of a boring nerd like Carrey and cheat on him once, but over and over again. She'll probably keep whoring it up until she's too old and/or diseased to make that work for her, and then she'll live with a lot of cats. Many people think this is \"progressive,\" but it's really just the cultural equivalent of a Thalidomide baby: a nasty mutation that doesn't do anyone any good.The script should have known this, too. I hate how this movie unironically presents me with this \"quirky\" love story like it's doing me a favor, when all it's doing is trying to sell me some bullsh*t platitude about \"meeting the right person\" instead of stepping back and asking why these people are such losers in the first place. That's why this movie is so popular, too, because people are idiots who agree with its pretension that \"weird\" people just need to find other \"weird\" people to have relationships with, and then they'll be happy. The scene where the kids run the machine on Carrey and steal his food and liquor was just disgusting. What a couple of spoiled turds! They were such insufferable children that I stopped caring about the movie at all, I just wanted to see something bad happen to them. Like getting raped by wolves.\n",

      "Quirky describes both Jim Carey and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. Michael Gondry directs this exercise in futile love and heartbreak. Joel(Carey)and Clementine(Kate Winslet)are a couple who's relationship has ran its course. Experimental technology allows Clementine to have any and all memories of Joel erased from her mind. Joel reluctantly decides to do the same, but in the middle of the procedure he changes his mind and struggles to keep those memories he wishes to cherish. This romantic Sci-Fi is clever, humorous, heartbreaking and very entertaining. Rounding out the cast: Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood. The story is a definite head spinner. I was most impressed with Winslet and her various hair colors...tangerine being my favorite. And if nothing else; how can a movie with Dunst dancing in her panties be bad? A decent soundtrack keeps the flick changing gears. Listen for ELO, Beck and The Willowz.\n",

      "When Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory, he decides to have the same treatment to rid himself of all thoughts of her. As he is having his brain tinkered with by some seemingly incompetent techy geeks, Joel realises that he has made a mistake and wants to keep his memories meaning that he must somehow hide inside his head.I'm pretty sure I enjoyed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind back when it first hit DVD. Not so, this time around. While I didn't exactly hate the film on my second long-overdue viewing, I now feel that it is vastly overrated: it's reasonably fun for a while, but the scenes that occur inside Joel's mind as he is having his memories erased go on for way too long, comprising the majority of the movie.Round and round we go, watching the same thing over and over again, with a few cleverly integrated special effects to make us go 'Ooooo'. Carrey and Winslet put in passable central performances, Carrey reining in the gurning as best he can, and Winslet looking and acting suitably quirky, but when all is said and done, there simply isn't enough of a plot to drive a 108-minute movie.5.5/10, not rounded up to 6 for that terrible scene where Carrey plays his four-year-old self.\n",
      "177\n",
      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" may be a contender for most pretentious movie title of all time, but at least the film is not as bad. Actually, it has a couple good moments and Kate Winslet delivers a serious contender for career-best performance. Nice to see her nominated for an Oscar here. Jim Carrey is not on the same level, but still very good and it would have been nice to see him nominated too. For anything. What a joke the Academy has still not nominated him for his many great performances. Unfortunately, this is also almost all positive I can say. The film was directed by Michel Gondry and also written by him together with Charlie Kaufman. The duo won an Oscar for the film's script. I certainly prefer Gondry's \"L'√©cume des jours\".In my opinion, the writing is really bad at times. Scenes like Carrey's character being his 5-year-old self, but still looking his normal age are so absurd that not even a comedic genius like Carrey can make it work. And the story away from the two protagonists is also pretty bad. I usually like Ruffalo, but his story with Kirsten Dunst's character (completely forgettable) added nothing to the film. Also that an apparently serious medical practice leaves a patient at an assistant doctor's home, a guy who is constantly stoned and drinking, is really disappointing.There was so much potential here. Carrey and Winslet have amazing chemistry and a better script could have turned this into a truly magical film that would have been so so memorable in terms of romance and potential tragedy. But it was all lost in the script of this 105-minute work here. Truly sad to see. The filmmakers tried to be too smart for their own good with constantly changing realities, locations and characters. Luckily, the 2 lead actors save it somehow from being an entirely unwatchable film. As a whole, I recommend it, but not with a lot of enthusiasm.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is one of the strangest romantic dramas you'll ever see. Jim Carry, hurt after his ex girlfriend had her memories of him removed, decides to do the same only to find he still loves her and it may be too late to correct his mistake. ESOTSM was a frustrating experience for me. This is full of beautifully acted scenes which are well directed and feel meaningful. Jim Carry has never been better and probably should have been nominated for an Oscar. Kate Winslet is completely superb. Those moments are strong and enjoyable and decently directed. That's what I want to see. I don't want to see what follows, which is a load of bizarre, surreal science fiction nonsense which is just confusing but that's what I get. I can enjoy beautifully acted scenes of drama or I can watch some nonsensical inside your head rubbish which hyper-actively zips from scene to scene like Twitchy the squirrel from Hoodwinked. I cannot do both at the same time.Easily one of the most overrated films of the 2000s, ESOTSM is an interesting film instead of a particularly good one. It's well acted, though Kirsten Dunst who is well regarded for some reason is pretty weak. The direction is OK and there is some very clever writing. Sadly, it's just a great big mess. As a result of the films insistence on surreal stupidity, it loses its message and its emotional impact. As Jim Carry races through his mind trying to avoid allowing his memories to be erased, 2 other characters are trying to find him on a computer. That is like me trying to keep up with the message of this movie. To be fair, it has some promising early scenes and there are various truths about love and heartache which feel genuine and important. Thankfully, the film doesn't veer into sentimental stupidity and isn't anyway near as unbearable as many other romantic dramas from the 2000s. There is definitely sunshine here, but it certainly isn't eternal. Everyone else seems to love this movie, so it seems I am alone in my opinion. It's well acted and written at times and I may give it another go. If I can even be bothered, which is doubtful.5/10\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", one of the most overrated films of recent years, is mostly a parable about how humans should accept their destiny instead of escaping it. But while the general meaning is fairly simple, the script is complex, using a non-linear narrative (a la \"Lost Highway\" or \"Memento\"), confusing past and present, dream and reality, the lives of the main characters etc.The direction further enhances this elaborate scheme: there are cut-ups, special effects, imaginative montage techniques, but also a post-modern overlapping between genres. Thus the film is sometimes a lyrical love-story, at other times a comedy, realist drama, Freudian analysis and so on. Unfortunately, a big part of the movie resorts to Hollywood melodrama (complete with generic sentimental soundtrack music). It feels as if the director is mostly interested in showing off his skills rather than presenting an interesting and organic movie. Vastly inferior to the similar \"L'Appartement\" (1996, Gilles Mimouni).\n",

      "ESOTSM continues Kaufman's trend of having a stunningly original idea (or series of ideas) but being unable to come up with an ending.Firstly, it's a little shaky that Joel is simply able to plant a command in his own head to 'meet her in Montauk' before the erasure completes. Fair enough, he goes. She sees him. Initiates contact as before. It's do-able, but not rock solid.Second, and worse, is the - seemingly insignificant and diverting - subplot of Mary and her boss's previous romance coming to the fore, causing her to send all the tapes out thus enabling Joel and Clementine to say what the hell, let's go for it anyway. It all happens because the boss's wife happens to get suspicious and show up at Joel's house right when her husband happens to be making out with Mary. Again, it 'aint rock solid.It's an ending essentially birthed by two coincidences (arguably). The fact that one of the coincidences is plonked at the start of the film doesn't alter the fact this is a chance ending.Let's back up. I wouldn't really care if I felt more involved. I'd suspend disbelief more. I hate nitpicking, but the reason I'm doing it is the film failed to move me.What is it? A comedy? Nope. Is it a drama? Kind of. But it isn't very dramatic, or, it fails to fully exploit dramatic opportunities in the script. What's a good drama? American Beauty. You care for every single character in that film. Empathy and curiosity.And this? Well, I was curious, sure. It's a clever idea executed in a clever way. In fact this film has clever written all over it. Like Kaufman's previous work. But BJM made me laugh. Adaptation had humour and drama and characters you cared about. This...doesn't.It's very difficult to pin it down, as fundamentally we have a stunning idea, a good script, presented in a style totally befitting it, great performances...and I just didn't care. I've seen it twice.Adaptation and BJM both had lovable losers. You want John Cusack's puppeteer to succeed. You want Nic Cage's Kaufman to find happiness and overcome his angst. Jim Carey's Joel? Uh...I'll get back to you.Jim definitely can't be faulted. It's just that, in our attempt to empathize, we have surprisingly little to go on. He's a quiet guy who falls for a quirky self-confessed f*cked up girl. They have a series of generic boyfriend/girlfriend times together which we the audience see in reverse order (p.s. generic to the power of Kaufman's quirkiness...but still generic).Thing is, the relationship is so obviously flaky to the core that who cares if they give it another shot in the end? Not I. Give it a month and see whether they're together.All of which is a very long winded way of repeating what I've already said - this film didn't involve me.I know it has a great 'point', but so does Mr and Mrs Smith and that was one of the most horrendous films I've ever seen. A 'point' simply isn't enough. Neither is a clever idea.\n",

      "The theme, the story, the acting, have been covered thoroughly by other reviewers here, and I won't cover these topics yet again. On the whole I agree with the majority that all of these were excellent.The film would have been excellent in all respects were it not for two factors that I haven't seen discussed much, if at all, elsewhere. One of these is artistic and the other a combination of artistic and technical. First, the sequences of Joel's \"internal\" mental scenes as Clementine is being erased from his memory are too long - two or three or even six or seven surreal and poignant fading memories would have been plenty - by the time I'd seen what seemed like a dozen or more the point(s) had been made, I began to check my watch, waiting for the _story_ to move onward, Second, the excessive hand-held camera work is annoying. I realize that this cinematographic style is a current fad, but it was really quite distracting particularly in the first 45 minutes or so. While it never reached the nausea level, the continual camera motion kept me from getting \"into\" the film for quite a while. The overall feel of the film is clearly intended to be surreal, rather than real, so, with due respect to the director's expertise, I would maintain that the realism implied by the hand-held camera actually interfered with the intended artistic impression.I started out expecting a 9 based on reviews; halfway through the film this had dropped to a 5 or so; by the end I was back up to an 8, which would have been 9 except for the two factors I've just mentioned.\n",

      "*Very small Spoiler section at foot of page* Nice. That is the word I would use to describe this film, however it would have been 'nice' if this movie had been a 15 minute short but sadly the director decided it would be much better to make a 2 hour feature out of 15 minutes worth of material and fill in the blanks with a whole lot of 'nice'. The end product, quite frankly, is something that could result in a hangover. I can't stress enough how good and deep this film *could* have been. This film is half decent but it is not really all that smart or intelligent, in fact this movie is pretty much the epitome of dim and the humour here is fairly slapstick. That's maybe what lessened the impact for me, this was supposedly really though provoking, nope this is a fairly average 'chick flick'/romantic drama masquerading as intelligent art-house fare with a sci-fi twist, unfortunately quoting some poetry does not equate to intelligent. I appreciate the noble intentions and admit it had a refreshing feel good factor about it but unfortunately the sunshine really struggled to shine through Kuafman and Gondry's pretentious, patronizing and often tedious script. Some of the dialog left my intelligence feeling rather insulted, as did the film as a whole.With that out of the way I still felt this film was not really great on an entertainment level either. It's like a home movie, I don't just mean the shaky camera work but this is basically a selection of sentimental moments from 2 lover's relationship with a few childhood memories thrown in for good measure. I'm not against sentimental, in fact I sometimes enjoy it especially in something like Old Yeller for example, as long as it's not over done in 'grown up' films, like it is here. People who are very sentimental and who enjoy romantic comedies would enjoy this film the most. However if you have an aversion for over the top sentimentality, eccentric behavior and (especially deserving of a 'warning' label) stoned student types spouting poetry then you will probably want to be euthanized after watching this film! This is the tale of 2 lovers , Clementine and Joel (played adequately by Winslet and Carrey) who break up after a silly argument, Clem's hasty reaction to this is to permanently erase Joel from her memory via a revolutionary new technique. Upon finding out, Joel gets the same treatment as revenge but then has a change of heart mid erasing and attempts to salvage his memories of their relationship by hiding Clem in various recollections from his past. Where this film was lost on me I feel is that I found the lead characters completely unlikeable, the thought of meeting such people sends shivers down my spine never mind taking a look at their lives and relationships. Clem is one of the most irritating characters I have seen in a long while, she's a 30 something student/hippie type who loves to changes her hair colour with her mood and loves a good emotional outburst for no good reason every now and then. Kaufman seems to think that making her eccentric will somehow transform her from shallow, immature and moody to likable and deep. No, no, NO! Then Joel is almost as bad, he too is a tad immature and he is a complete, hopeless loser. The other characters involved are even more hideous so I won't even dare go into details.The whole message, which will largely depend on what the viewer extracts from the film, is roughly dispensed through some elementary ideas and clich√©s - love is irrational and makes us do irrational things and 'love at first sight'. The film also asks important questions relating to what memories mean to us and how they affect who we are, and if we could erase them would we make the same mistakes again. The whole topic of being able to erase memories is a very deep one, while the film delves into a very important and emotive aspect of the human condition via the concept it ignores a whole barrel load of possible directions to take the plot, deciding instead to concentrate almost solely on the leads relationship resulting in a very linear, slightly shallow experience. The plot also seems to stall with regularity, perhaps as a byproduct of having limited room to expand, it just plods and stutters along seemingly forever.*Spoilers* The film is very surreal at times and it is in the hazy insights into Joel's memories that the film achieves it's few high points, we get glimpses of mildly traumatic childhood experiences and most importantly the first meeting with Clem. It is upon the parting of Joel and his memories of Clementine that the film peaks, when he concedes his quest to salvage the situation is futile and decides to simply enjoy what little time he has with his last recollections of her and the time they spent together. That sequence is pretty touching and *almost* manages to make the film feel worth while. However it was not enough to rescue the whole experience for me as I had already developed a feeling of mild nausea before that point. The film was a bit pop arty at times but there were some lovely images featuring dream like sunsets and street parades and the director did create a unique atmosphere, I give him credit for that at least. Overall a disappointment, not a complete disaster but I can't help but feel this was an opportunity somewhat squandered. I did not really feel the impact I felt the film tried to deliver as I could not find it in me to empathize with the two leads, but I did appreciate the messages they were attempting to deliver.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has a very philosophical and ethical question to ask us: Would you have an operation to forget someone completely? The movie manages to stick to not just the plot point of Joel and Clementine but also, the scientists who work in the business and what they think about what they are doing. Watching this movie reminded me of the dreams that I've had and how you wish they would go away or wish they were real but you can't wake up. Which is what Joel was stuck in. The whole movie is given a quite modern aesthetic which could be a hint at how close this procedure is from actually existing.\n",

      "I've never had a movie break me down and make my heart ache the way this one did when I first watched it (in the theater no less). This could be an unfair comparison though since I had a recent break-up right before watching this movie. Jim Carrey played Joel as a real person and did so in such a believable way that I immediately became impressed with his range when I had been lukewarm about his other attempts at drama.I've known couples like Joel and Clementine and at some scenes I've been them. Of my friends who didn't like the movie they were always people with no experience or very little. I think what makes people love this movie is realizing how realistic it is and respecting that.One of the things that makes Eternal Sunshine stand out is its depth. The movie has little hints for you to find and uncover if you watch it multiple times. If you pay close attention you can see that Joel and Clementine have probably erased each other more than once as have other couples. It makes sense that if your memories are gone but who you are as a person is the same that you'd find the same people attractive and have the same desires and of course the same problems and issues. And so one of the main points of the story is a reminder that, \"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it\". Therefore, the only way to grow as a person and progress is to keep your memories, no matter how much it hurts. It is part of growing and moving on. It is part of progress.\n",

      "As the title says, I find the characters somewhat immature in this movie. I'd like to think people are more mature than as portrayed in this film. But I realize some of the characters obviously have problems which can mess you up far into \"adulthood\", and so with that in mind and without going into a whole discussion about what the writer(s) might be trying to convey...perhaps that we're all immature or that love makes us so or that love transcends differences in people...I'll continue.This is a film that, if nothing else (in case I haven't mentioned it enough yet), is about love. I get the feeling it might be a metaphor..something like that saying \"it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.\" Although these people are trying to have their memories of previous botched relationships erased, they both cling to a certain (however small) part of their love. As we follow Jim Carrey's character, we see him realize he doesn't want to forget the beauty of the moments he shared with his lover and he desperately fights to keep those memories.I saw this film many years ago, in theaters if I remember correctly, and I remember how my friends really liked it and I thought it was okay but overrated and the characters were kinda dumb (what I now see as immaturity). Seeing it now, mid 2010, and having experienced a lot more of life and the people in it I can say this film is truly beautiful. If you are in the mood for a love story, but more of a disjointed and slightly (emphasis on slightly) Memento-style presentation than the usual lame romantic comedy - look no further. I think I can say this with some authority and authenticity: unless you are a young male, do not avoid.7/10\n",

Jim Carey was great (an awesome display of well-crafted understatement, unlike his usual over-the-top Robin William impersonations). Ditto for Kate Winslett (it is worth money to see good Brit actors \"speaking American\" as opposed to watching American hacks in their pathetic attempts at mimicking an English (usually crappy-Cockney) accent.

The storyline was simple and boring, the acting was mediocre at best, and the camera work was so jumbled up that it was hard to make sense of what we were seeing. It was like watching a film from someone who flunked out of film school. Personally, I am going to be wary of watching any movie by this writer or director in the future as I have a bitter taste in my mouth after this one. It was an assault on my intelligence to watch ad movie such as this. Save your money and do not buy or rent this movie when it comes out.\n",

      "\"Although retaining the terms 'schizoid' and 'schizophrenic' for the sane and psychotic positions respectively, I shall not, of course, be using these terms in their usual clinical psychiatric frame of reference, but phenomenologically and existentially.\" - R. D. LaingThough praised for its \"complex plot\", \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" serves up a rather simple tale about a once romantically linked couple who are inexorably drawn back together despite having their memories wiped by Lacuna Inc, a company which specialises in \"targeted memory erasure\".Most interesting about the film is the fact that it was directed by Michel Gondry. Gondry is a corporate advertisement (Levi Jeans, Smirnoff Vodka, Air France etc) and music video director, both of which are professions which require him to master short form rather than long form film-making, constantly shift aesthetic strategies without perfecting a singular style, bow to the fact that his TV work is caught in the blip-time perishability of consumer capitalism, and capture, hold and release his audience in as little time as possible.In other words, music videos and advertising not only epitomise the schizophrenia of the postmodern aesthetic, but require the artist himself to be schizoid - akin to the characters of this film - his identity in flux. No surprise then that Gondry's subsequent films (\"Be Kind Rewind\", \"The Science Of Sleep\" etc) all spend their running times jumping from one half-finished reconstruction of a previous film/thought/memory/image to the next, their narratives all splintered or fractured. Like Gondry's \"Be Kind Rewind\", a film in which a duo recreate scenes from their memories of past movies, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is itself a series of short-form \"music videos\" or \"advertisement-like\" memory fragments, quirkily strung together.Indeed, philosophers like Frederic Jameson and Jean Baudrillard have long characterized postmodernity in terms of \"amnesia\" or \"memory loss\", aligning its ripples with clinical Schizophrenia, split personalities, temporal discontinuity and bipolar like emotional ground tones.But \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is not only about science and society accelerating forgetfulness in a kind of Alzheimer's ward for young adults, but the desire to preserve remembrances of events, or rather, re-engineer memories to conform them to one's world-view, which of course is the clinical description of the narcissist. Where the film differs from most postmodern films about \"memory\" is that it couples its nostalgia to the understanding that memory is rarely about the past and always about the present.Beyond Gondry's TV commercial aesthetic you have Charlie Kaufman's screenplay. All of Kaufman's films revolve around a neurotic artist or self-pitying depressive who is undergoing some existential despair whilst being trapped in a narrative which takes the shape of a formalist game (often a self-referential meta-story or quirky surrealist fantasy in which the neurotic hero desires to obliterate himself). Here our hero is played by Jim Carrey, but his intellectual sad sack routine is identical to that of John Cusack in \"Being John Malkovich\" and Nicholas Cage in \"Adaptation\", two other films by Kaufman.Of course Kaufman's \"postmodern angst\" is not unique to cinema. In the world of twentieth century paintings, for example, we have Pablo Picasso's fractured world of vacant-eyed, disjointed beings, Edward Hopper's flat landscapes populated by emotionally out-of-tune men and women, the predatory horror of Willem de Kooning, Salvador Dali's obliteration of objective reality, Warhol's smirking trivialisation of mechanical reproductions and Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\", which seems to capture the horror of being a cipher in a world of hideously swirling near-formless shapes.The anxieties of all these artists stem from, or coincide with, the rise of philosophical theories of scepticism and irrationalism, a growing distrust in the cognitive faculties of perception and reason, the development of scientific theories such as evolution, entropy and uncertainty, the technological revolutions spurred by the combination of science and capitalism (which led to fears of dehumanisation) and the spread of liberalism and free markets (which in turn caused the political left and members of the artistic avant garde to view political development as a series of deep disappointments).Gradually these anxieties expanded such that art-work seemed to be about its own self-elimination, those who followed Picasso and Munch obsessed with reporting their depressed observations, retreating from the world and proceeding to strip away from art anything that they could. Many eliminated as much content as they could from their works, art becoming a self-contained study of dimension, colour, and composition or a game of self-reference and self-annihilation.This is the kind of cultural nihilism which many postmodernist film directors find themselves in today. Unlike existential directors of the past, everyone from art house folk (Dreyer, Bergman, Herzog, Bresson, Tarkovsky, Antioni, Wenders etc) to humble noir or Hollywood directors of the 40s and 50s (Nicholas Ray, John Huston etc), all of whom used the assumption of nihilism as the basis for the revaluation of all social values, postmodernists like Kaufman instead find themselves wallowing in the dead ends of their intellectual limits, locked into finding new and clever ways to playfully soliloquise over the vacuity of existence. Kaufman states this himself in \"Adaptation\", likening this very artistic movement to an Ouroboros snake consuming its own head.7.9/10 ‚Äì A trial run for Gondry's \"The Science Of Sleep\", a more interesting film. Still, despite it's hackneyed message (\"It's better to lose a lover than to have never loved at all\"), some severe overacting by Jim Carey and Kate Winslet, and Gondry assaulting us with every annoying gimmick he picked up making corporate videos, this is a very likable film. Worth two viewings. Once for pleasure, once for pain.\n",

      "After the relationship between a couple sours, they don't just cut their losses and move on, letting time heal their wounds. No, the woman undergoes a novel procedure that selectively erases her memory of him. Not to be outdone, he decides to have the same procedure himself to purge her from his brain but then starts to have second thoughts during the procedure. After an intriguing start, the convoluted plot turns into a dreary mess, much like writer Kaufman's \"Adaptation.\" It flashes forward and backward in time and veers from reality to dreams to subconscious thought to some combination thereof.

Without benefit, it seems to rely too much on vagueness and predicable scenes to explain parts of the movie.I believe that Winslet did a very good job in her role, and so much that when I first started watching the movie, I had no idea that it was her until 30 minutes into the movie!

Maybe I should watch it again as some films do improve with a second viewing but I just don't want to waste another 2 hours of my life on the film!!

      "Talk about running an idea into the ground! This film takes one somewhat trite sci-fi idea spawned during the pulp era -- a helmet-like machine that can be fitted over the head to erase selected memories -- and lets us watch it work on two quirky, unhappy lovers... and that's about it. Way too much of the movie involves the flashily filmed fragmentary memories, dreams, half-memories, fantasies, etc. etc. experienced by the Jim Carrey character as he undergoes this improbable procedure (which proves the excuse for a number of special effects). Watching such fragments, on and on, is about as tedious as listening to someone recount his dream. I've seen three films so far written by Charles Kaufman, and the only one I've enjoyed was \"Adaptation.\" This one -- like \"Being John Malkovich\" -- began to bore and annoy me before it was halfway through.\n",

      "The fundamental problem with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is that, unlike the other films made from Charlie Kaufman's original screenplays - Adaptation, Being John Malkovich - there's really basically only one idea at work here. The acting is excellent (probably the best work that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have ever done, and kudos to the great English character actor Tom Wilkinson), the digital effects are great, and the elliptical plot is quite emotionally moving for something so clever, but once you know what's going on (and i'm not going to ruin it by saying what it is) then all you can do is sit back and wait for the Halloweenish funfair ride to finish. The great thing about seeing Being John Malkovich for the first time was the sheer mind-blowing inventiveness of the story, which left you constantly wondering what the hell was going to happen next; and likewise for Adaptation, which was just as original but had even more layers upon layers and circles within circles that Kaufman's laser beam of a brain always managed to refer back to the various disparate threads of the plot(s) without letting the whole thing dissolve into a self-canceling tangled mess. Even though the ideas and the intellect on display in the writing of these films are dazzling in their brilliance they still manage to move your heart as well as your brain, and while Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind will also make you laugh out loud at certain scenes and (possibly) cry in others, it's my opinion that maybe if Spike Jonze - who directed Adaptation and Malkovich - had directed this one as well then he would have pushed Kaufman creatively a bit more, because by halfway through the movie you pretty much know what's going to happen for the rest of it. I did really enjoy it but i'm looking forward even more to the next Charlie Kaufman/Spike Jonze collaboration which is currently in production.\n",

      "After being blanked by her when trying to make up, Joel discovers that his girlfriend (ex) has had all memory of their relationship wiped from her memory using a process carried out by Dr Mierwiak. Distraught by this, Joel decides to undergo the same treatment. Mierwiak's operators (Frank and Patrick) come to Joel's home to carry out the process but, as his memories are wiped, Joel realises that he has happy memories, albeit they are tinged with pain now. He tries to escape with his memories of Clementine and hid her in his deeper memories. Meanwhile Patrick has stolen Joel's memories and is using them to try and seduce Clementine.If one thing surprised me about this film it was just how successful it seems to have been. I say this because the audience that makes a hit is mostly a young one. This film requires a maturity or experience in relationships that many younger people will be fortunate not to have. The film relies on you having had a break up where one partner moves on without delay, leaving you in their wash ¬ñ just as Joel had here. Sadly I have had such an experience, and the idea of washing away painful memories but also wanting to keep them for their happiness is one I could relate to. Perhaps this is why, for my money, this is the most emotionally involving script that Kaufman has done yet. Normally he is very quirky but that's it, here he shows a real solid bit of emotional that really helps what is actually quite a weak plot.The story follows a thread within Joel's mind as well as a thread involving Patrick and Frank. Both these threads combine to make the film's final point but as pieces of narrative they are rather thin. However what keeps them going is both the emotional core of the film and the innovative writing and direction. The emotional involvement comes from the very real picture of Joel ¬ñ hurt to his core by his ex but slowly realising that her memory is worth having. This thread works much better than the 'real world' one, and it's purpose is not fully clear until the end (although it is still interesting and enjoyable). Only the film's conclusion put me off a little bit ¬ñ it sort of concludes that our faults will come out and that we will really hurt those we are with, at the end Clementine accepts this with Joel.I agree with this but it is a Hollywood ending that people would do this ¬ñ in my experience people do not fight through faults, they bare them for as long as they can until they decide to give up. Like I said, Hollywood happy ending. This isn't a bad ending because I was emotionally involved with the characters and was happy with the ending, if not the idea that it promoted.The writing is very clever and inventive (although how many times can Kaufman write scripts around the same theme?) but it is the direction that impressed me even more. The way that the script is brought to the screen and that a world of memories within the mind is displayed so well so as never to be confusing or to lose the audience. It looks great and the deletion of memories is delivered with a very effective mix of styles and presentation tools. To me what made this film so enjoyable was this mix of a clever script with a director who has enough vision to deliver what it requires.The cast are also pretty good, with the only problem being that they occasionally play second fiddle to the visuals and ideas around them. Carrey is very good and shows a subtlety that Ace Ventura fans may not believe he could have had. He has quite a few solid roles under his belt now and he is looking like he is cutting a leading man niche for himself. Winslet is also good and prevents her character from being almost totally annoying ¬ñ why Joel sees anything in her is a mystery to me! She has less character than Carrey is given, she is either hyper in memory or a little annoying in the real world. The support cast have the lesser thread to work with and their characters are lesser as a result. Ruffalo is impressive but not just for this role. I have seen him in several films and he is different in each: an interesting actor that I'll continue to watch. Wood is a bit too dippy and it's 'too soon' since LOTR for me to be able to shake off the idea that he is Frodo! Wilkinson is a good presence and Dunst is OK despite overplaying the 'carefree' section of her character so that the 'with memories' section will be more impacting.Overall I am surprised that this film is so high up the top 100 on imdb already and I personally doubt that it will keep it over time. That said this is still the best script/film to come from Kaufman thus far. On top of the usuals, he has also delivered emotional involvement with the film and it is this that makes it so engaging. The direction is very impressive and does a great job of bringing the script to the screen. These factors combined with a winning (if low key) lead from Carrey make for a film that deserves to be seen by many viewers, regardless of experience or age.\n",

      "I suppose I have to be classified a contrarian now because I like the way movies once were. These days it seems by far the vast majority of the films the critics rave about are ones that are \"different\". Movies that are there just for enjoyment just don't seem to get made as often these days.I missed this film because it only played at our local art theater. I never do see anything there because the movies are always given extremely favorable ratings but are always lousy (IMHO) films from an enjoyment standpoint.I finally broke down and rented the DVD of this because of the number of Golden Globe nominations and good stars involved. When will I ever learn that if it is considered great by the critics and the \"in crowd\" in Hollywood, it is practically guaranteed to be a waste of time as entertainment. If I could give a zero rating, this would get it for sure. The fact it is so high in the IMDb all time ratings is to me a sad commentary on the state of our world.I may be old and I may come from another era but one thing I know for sure. By definition a comedy is supposed to be funny, like ha-ha laugh out loud funny - especially if it has Jim Carrey. To classify Spotless Mind as a comedy requires someone with a very twisted mind indeed. I can concede the acting was good and that it was well filmed and quite different. There is no way however that it is a comedy. Comedy is Chaplin, Abbot & Costello, Lemmon and Matthau, et. al.If you are expecting to laugh or find anything funny in this piece of trash, save your time and money. I suppose they are making so few real comedies now that they have to stretch like Jim Carrey in Mask to call fantasy/sci-fi drama a comedy.\n",

      "I wouldn't call it a bad movie, it's just not my cup of tea.I also struggled with a couple of the plot points throughout the film, for instance Mary's choice to send out the tapes to everyone who'd gotten someone erased from their minds. I mean, sure, given her viewpoint on the company and the situation, it probably seemed like the ethical choice to mail out the tapes to everyone so they'd know what they'd done, but it was also selfish. She was in pain, she'd just discovered a major aspect to her job was a lie and it makes sense that maybe she'd send out the tapes so she wasn't the only one who felt stupid or hurt, but its just cruel. To inflict the pain you felt on so many others who probably had honest reasons to get the procedure isn't ethical, it's revenge, and it's childish, just like some of her other choices during the film.As for do I think Clem and Joel will stay together? Who knows. With the knowledge of how their relationship went the first time around, it seems entirely unlikely. However, now that they're aware of the tapes and their past mistakes, there's a realm of possibility where they work through their problems and come to appreciate one another for who they truly are instead of fighting.Overall, did I enjoy my time watching the movie?

      "I vividly remember the first time I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I was a sophomore in high school, and I didn't know movies at all. Then I went to see this movie with some of my friends, and I remember being totally transfixed by what was happening on screen. It was an awakening for me, that ignited my passion for movies in general.The writing in Eternal Sunshine is fantastic. The screenplay is full of interesting, creative ideas. No character ever feels false. What's remarkable about this movie is that we spend over half of it literally inside the main character's head. Charlie Kaufman, and Michel Gondry as well, do an incredible job of recreating that experience for the viewer, both visually and verbally. As Joel's memory is being erased, things start to change in the dream. Fence posts fly up into the stratosphere and disappear. Streetlights flicker off. The scientist at the doorway has no face.Anchoring this movie is a beautifully understated, sensitive performance by Jim Carrey. You can sense the brokenness in his character, the damage. He's a sympathetic protagonist, even if he isn't perfect. And then Kate Winslet comes on as Clementine, a pure force of life, and steals all the scenes she's in. The scientists are all played by known actors, and they do fine. But Carrey is the biggest surprise of the movie. He should honestly do more dramatic work.I talked about the visuals a bit already, but Gondry deserves credit for a large amount of why this movie works so well. The way he represents Joel's brain is very imaginative, even brilliant. No scene really hits a false note. He also brought in Jon Brion to do the soundtrack, and it's one of my favorite movie soundtracks ever.This is one of those movies that just comes together from top to bottom, to make a whole greater than the sum of its parts. I haven't even talked about the philosophical and ethical questions Eternal Sunshine tackles, or its beautiful observations on love and human connection. Not to mention the ambiguous ending that could not have been more perfect. When I walked out of that theater, I knew I'd just seen a great film. It made me interested in films, period. So it will always have a spot in my movie-loving heart.Highly recommended, 9/10.\n",

      "Having just returned from an advanced screening of this movie, it's hard to find exactly what I want to say about it without giving too much away.Jim Carrey turns in a solid performance, and for the most part one of his most understated and nuanced.  In all, the acting is solid by all concerned. As far as that goes, this is a very good film.On the other hand, I found myself thoroughly confused at various points. There are elements of the story from the beginning that don't make sense at the end.  Again, I don't want to give it all away before people have had a chance to see the movie for themselves, but I will say that the ending is rather contrived and, in the context of the movie, doesn't make particular sense.The plot of the movie is quite good, but the storytelling is choppy and the way it's been edited together gets rather harsh at times.  This probably won't make much sense right now, but I thought that there were points at which the movie was so obviously trying to be obscure that it put me off quite a bit.The cinematography got downright annoying at times.  The whole movie is shot on handheld cameras (I think digital as well), and at times the image bounces around so much that it's hard on the eyes.Perhaps the best way to sum this movie up is simply to say that it had good ideas, but the execution isn't great.  It did get a bit sappy at times, too. Elijah Wood's performance is perhaps the weakest of the film; he comes across as rather whiny and cold.  His character doesn't have a lot of screen time, though, so it's not a major impediment.It's not terrible, but it's not terrific either.  The whole core of the film really comes down to the old platitude that one has to take the good with the bad in relationships and that one shouldn't be willing to give up the good memories of one's life in order to escape from the bad ones.  Perhaps this is part of why the sentimentality is so overblown at times.The film will benefit from the presence of Jim Carrey and might do fairly well at the box office.  That being said, it's no \"Truman Show.\"\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of Jim Carrey's best movies. The cast is great all around, from Jim Carrey to Tom Wilkinson, everyone gives a great performance. The movie is also beautifully shot by Michel Gondry. His work in this movie is amazing. The script, which was amazingly written by Charlie Kaufman, is super emotional and has a great tone to it. This movie has everything going for it. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a great movie that I don't even have any issues with this movie. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you see it.\n",

      "The dream sequence and the conversation is so lovely that it makes the movie very re watchable. Shows both sides of coin and why love is so easy and difficult at the same time. Very deep philosophical movie. Must watch.\n",

      "I hated romantic films like for real I hate them so much ... until I saw this masterpiece. Jim carry was freakin awesome the idea is amazing and they did it very good to be honest. but there was so many weird things that I cant understand until this moment sooooo. amazing idea, amazing actors, so many weird things.\n",

      "Director Michel Gondry keeps the pace moving and the audience on edge through the twists and turns of Charlie Kauffman's brilliant Oscar winning script. Kate Winslet is excellent as is Jim Carrey who delivers an electric performance that dives into the deep pain we feel in his mind. With an ensemble cast that keeps the acting top notch, Carrey and Winslet racked up award nominations for their respective roles. Ellen Kuras delivers the cinematography as an important visual gem as if a character in the story. A tale about a reserved Joel (Jim Carrey) who has a dark break up with the once bright Clementine (Kate Winslet) in his life.\n",
      "And the process of erasing the good and the bad memories that enlighten and haunt us.\n",

      "This is my second favorite Kaufman film and still one of my favorite films! It hits almost all the emotional beats you could imagine in a movie and does so in unexpected ways.Gondry and Kaufman make an excellent creative team and their individual styles compliment each other in really exciting and interesting ways. Gondry's visual wizardry is put to excellent use on a story that really benefits from it. I would love to see these two work together again!\n",

Despite of what mary has sent them, at the end they know that they will stuck with each other again even though they will hate of what coming in the future. This movies is underrated.\n",

      "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is simply one of the best 'romantic' movies for portraying love in its all its messy yet wonderful forms in a creative and imaginative way. The movie focuses on Joel's and Clementine's relationship, or 'post relationship'. Upon Joel finding out that Clementine has had her memories erased of him, he decides to do the same. However, as he travels further and further into his memories and stumbles into the happier times they had together, he realises that he no longer wants her erased, and wants to cherish the love they had from their earlier days. The film was incredibly bleak and harrowing, portraying love and relationships as incredibly messy and doomed, thus creating a cold and piercing atmosphere throughout. However, the film gave a powerful message on what it is to love, and that with all bad memories of our relationships comes good ones, showing that you cannot just erase how you feel. The style was unique and atmospheric, creating a dreamy and ethereal experience. The film was potent and engaging throughout thanks to the mystifying soundtrack, incredible lighting and effects, and the very raw yet poignant performances from Kate Winslet and Jim Carey, who had one of the best dynamics and chemistry I've seen on screen. There was never a dull moment as the film had an unusually fractured and disjointed style, conveying the disorientation and bewilderment Joel feels as he tries desperately to keep the memories of Clementine before he runs out of time. The side characters didn't feel significant at first, but later became part of something much more. The side plot had a similar dilemma to Clementine's and Joel's, teaching us that there's little point in trying to forget someone as you will always find a way back to them. The ending was incredibly moving and powerful, and in a way you can't understand. The movie leaves you feeling confused at their relationship, and you struggle with whether you should be feeling happy or pessimistic. When a movie leaves you feeling like this, you know it's a masterpiece. Highly recommend!\n",

      "I really enjoyed this movie. Jim Carrey doesn't really do it for me as a serious actor most of the time, but I loved him in this role. Kate Winslet was such a fun character, she (like Joel) made me feel alive. Charlie Kaufman is an amazing writer, that mixed real life and fantasy elements. The chemistry between the main actors was on point, and the supporting cast wasn't too pushy, but wasn't so in the background you didn't pay attention to them. Kirsten Dunst was kind of an underrated character in this movie. I would've liked to see her get some sort of supporting actress nomination. Also, the score was pretty solid and underrated.\n",

      "Although this movie isn't as great as Synecdoche, New York on repeated viewings, it certainly is still worth your time for another watch. With the intricate ways that it plays with the continuity of the story, this film has one of the greatest screenplays to this day. It's masterfully directed and contains many expertly used camera tricks to play with reality. It has one of Jim Carrey's best performances in my opinion and definitely an outstanding film that everyone should watch!\n",

      "This film occupied my thoughts for a full two months after I watched it. I even ended up putting it on my Top Ten List.In my opinion, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give career-best performances in this movie. They are casted against type and both of their performances are absolutely mesmerizing. Winslet deserved that Oscar nomination, and it's criminal that Carrey didn't get one!The rest of the cast give excellent performances, as well. Even Tom Wilkinson who apparently did not have a good time.The characters are well-defined and interesting! You care deeply about Joel and Clementine and you just want to see them get together by the end of the movie.The drama is so intense! Every time there's a heavy scene you're at the edge of your seat. The music helps with this quite a bit.The comedy is hilarious! Jim Carrey's comedic talent really shines in this one!The music is powerful! At no point does it ever feel overbearing or unnecessary during the emotional scenes.Speaking of the emotional scenes, you'll be crying! I certainly did!There's so much bizarre yet beautiful imagery to behold in this film! A lot of it is very quick, so you really gotta pay attention! But when you see it you can't believe it!The editing is phenomenal! Some of the best I've ever seen! It can be but it serves to make you feel the anxiety that scene is trying to project onto you.I'd go so far as to call this Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay. Yes, that's a bold statement. But like everyone else who loves film I think he's a genius and honestly the concept of choosing which of his films is his best, it really comes down to personal preference. Also, personal point, I love non-linear narratives! Part of the fun is putting the movie in chronological order!I love all the statements the movie makes about love, relationships, and selfishness. Especially the one it makes about how you should always cherish all the memories you've had with a lover, not try to block them out.The love story itself is very original and heartwarming! I have never seen the elements of romance, science fiction, and fantasy blended together so perfectly before! And the fact that it's presented in a non-linear format makes it that much better!This is truly the best film I've seen in the romance genre, and I think it's a masterpiece!\n",

      "This film is currently the 92th highest rated movie on IMDB and there are to this day 1,696 reviews on this site, so it's not like my review will matter that much. Still, I re-watched this movie after a few months and I thought it was time for me for tossing my views about this movie in the reviews section.One day Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) instead of going to work picks another train to Montauk, a shoreline zone on Long Island and he walks on the beach. On the way home he meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and they began a friendship. Suddenly she decides that she doesn't want to go on and she goes to a clinic run by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak where memories can be deleted. Joel soon realizes this and he does everything for erasing Clementine from his memory. However, time passes and this doesn't happen because down deep he really loves her. This is basically the plot for ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.So what I liked about the film? Michel Gondry's direction was very innovative with his use of handycam shots. Needless to say that the actors' performances are good. Jim Carrey unleashes his most serious side and he handles the part well. Kate Winslet is also very convincing (and she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress) and Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood give nice support throughout the movie. The script is very clever.My complaints about the movie are very few. Sure it's a bit depressing and weird looking at times but if you can look past this you can enjoy and like the movie for what it is.\n",

      "This was so intense to watch. This was draining. Exhausting. I could not watch this movie 15 years ago and I understand why. I was not equipped (yet) for it. I did not have the patience, the wisdom, the experience. It takes at least one true love and a heart break to fully embrace what the movie has to give.In the end we fully live when we fully love. Erasing memories of love equals to erasing pieces of life. This life that makes us who we are. Rejecting those memories is denying parts iof ourselves. Through love and heartbreak we learn, we fall and we eventually grow. We get ready for the next relationship. We get ready to do better. We get ready to eventually, maybe, love unconditionally.\n",

      "The writing, acting, premise and soundtrack make this one of the best movies I've ever seen.The mashup of art, music, love and creativity is a delight to watch. The cinematography is surreal and spectacular, and shows us the true essance of human relationships in their purest and most sincere form.Jim Carrey was outstanding and truly proves he's an exceptional actor, and not just a comedian.It's a story about love, melancholy, the highs and lows, self introspection. I really love this film.\n",

      "One of the most complex, Engaging, peculiarly structured, heart-warming, morbid and most wonderfully directed films I have ever watched. Jim Carrey was phenomenal as \"the broken soul\" character and the same applies to Kate Winslet, however, her character slightly differed. Every scene is littered with double- entendre and metaphors, Gondry mastered the correlation between the ubsurds and the relatable At certain moments it is in the same vain as \"The Truman Show\" but in as an impersonation more as recitniton or inspiration. If you are like me and like unique and ambushes movies, then \"Eternal Sunshine\" is a must watch! Hell, even the pacing has a deep a rotted meaning to the plot, I gantuntee you will walk away with a new- fangled philosophy for love and life.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is one of the best films I've ever seen. The plot revolves around Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey). They play a couple who's relationship has crumbled. Clementine ends up going to a doctor who specializes in this procedure that erases memories you would like to forget, and she erases all memory of Joel. After Joel finds out that she has done this, he also decides to have the procedure done. During the procedure, he starts to change his mind and doesn't want to let go of certain memories of her.This film features incredible performances by every single cast member. Kate Winslet in particular gives a remarkable performance, very deserving of that Academy Award nomination. And Jim Carrey is also great here, this is probably my favorite film of his filmography. If anyone thinks Carrey is only capable of doing comedy, then I'd suggest they watch this one, because he nails it. Kirsten Dunst gives a skilled supporting performance, as does Ruffalo, Wilkinson, and Wood. The writing is so well done and balanced. The dialogue between Clementine and Joel is very revealing and written in a beautiful way. When you cast great artists such as the two leads and give them writing like this, it's just bound to be a hit. I for sure suggest this wonderful film! 9/10.\n",

      "Over the years this has developed massive acclaim and a cult following, with many stating it's one of the best romance stories available. Whilst I do not slot into that following, I can appreciate the admiration that viewers give this. Joel falls in love with Clementine, they are complete opposites but are attracted to each other's qualities. Her impulsive nature does not always sit well with Joel, and suddenly the two have each other erased from their minds through a specialist company that deals with this procedure. Halfway through the process, Joel changes his mind and must attempt to savour his last memories of her. Concept aside, what separates this from other similar films is the editing and overall creative environment. One minute they are in a library, only to transition outside on a frozen lake. Inside a cosy lounge? Don't worry, rain will start to pour down. It reflects how the mind works. The scattered nature of the narrative, consistently switching from scene to scene, resembles our brains and how memories are mapped. There is no linear path to memories, when you think of something nostalgically you then suddenly think of something else. You may find this jarring and slightly confusing, but it works. It's an intriguing concept that is thoroughly explored both in technique and the moral implications. We even have subplots regarding the team who are leading the memory erasing process. I do find this detracts from the focus on Joel and Clementine which is the more important element to the film. Having said that, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have ample amount of screen time. Both playing roles that they do not typically perform, yet the chemistry felt real. At no point was I thinking \"this feels like typical Hollywood fabricated romance\". The indie feel of the film allows the filmmakers to explore themes of memories and the mind without tarnishing the central romance. A creative and intriguing drama.\n",

      "I never imagined that I would put Jim Carry as an elite actor considering his comedic background. I'm so used to him being silly and that led me to believe that he had nothing else to offer other than goofiness. Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind blew me out the water after seeing his performance. The movie itself is amazing and captivating, but seeing carry playing a serious role was just as surprising.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004 movie) has earned a place in moviegoers' hearts, not to mention plenty of \"best movies of the 21st-century\" lists. The mind-bending romantic tragedy with Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet is the perfect pairing of bizarre screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and whimsical French director Michel Gondry. If you think this makes the movie sound penetrable, you have no idea. As the movie opens, Joel is seized with an inexplicable compulsion to ditch work and take the train to Montauk, and on the train he meets Clementine. For all they know they have never seen each other before, but somehow there's a connection, a distant shadow of Deja Vu. During the course of the film, which moves freely, dazzlingly, forward and backward in time, they will each experience fragmentary versions of relationships they had, might have had, or might be having. This film in particular, is actually about a man named Joel (Jim Carrey) who is heartbroken to find out that his girlfriend (Kate Winslet) has gone through a procedure that deleted every memory of him from her mind, so he decides to do the same. In the process, he realises that he still loves her, and will do anything to keep his memories of her.The movie is a radical example of Maze Cinema, that style in which the story coils back upon itself, redefining everything and then throwing it up in the air and redefining it again.\n",
      "240\n",
      "The only redeeming thing about this film was the acting. Unfortunately, most of the actors do a little too good a job convincing you how pathetic their characters can be. I do not need to watch shallow people at their shallowest to make me feel deep. I haven't seen such self indulgent tripe aimed at wannabe intellectuals since Lost in Translation came out.Anyone who gave this film a nine or ten needs to spend a little more time at small theaters that play independent, documentary, foreign, and art house films so they know the difference. If you happen to live in the south Puget Sound area you should check out the Tacoma Grand Cinema.\n",
      "241\n",
      "One of the worst film I have ever seen. It is absolutely impossible to understand what was the purpose of the director. The characters were not well worked out and all of them were very unusual figure who never occur in the real life. I have always waited during the 2 hours that something will turn out, but even at the very last moment of the film I was as confused as the beginning. Maybe the purpose of the film to present how is the mental processes are taking place during a relationship, what is in the innermost of our brain. It was impossible to distinguish between the real situation and that which was only at the subconsious level. I think the American directors should watch more European art film because they should learn quite a lot.\n",

This film has a crappy unbelievable plot, dull characters. What a waste of my $10 to see it!!! If you want to see a excellent movie, go see starsky and hutch, or dawn of the dead. both are worth the money. If you insist on seeing a Jim Carrey movie rent Dumb and Dumber, the Mask or Liar!

      "This movie is terribly overrated. In a year of bad movies, it fit right in. Yet every year, critics need a top ten list, so this movie gets good pub simply because it involves Jim Carey and somewhat emotional themes. Seriously people, please bring some rationality back to the table. This movie is mundane in every facet, from acting, to writing, to the cinematography. Stop, for one second, and look at the movies ranked below it. There are some incredibly good films, such as Saving Private Ryan, Chinatown, Raging Bull, To Kill a Mockingbird, and L.A. Confidential. I would encourage all of you who gave it a good rating to go back and watch it again, and then reevaluate your ranking, but that's a curse I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.Knock this out of the top 50 and back to the top 5000 where it belongs.\n",

      "It's not even worth a corner of a star. I'd rather eat my eye. Jim Carrey should stick to comedy. For this movie should be ashamed of himself. Whilst in the cinema, unable to escape the torture, I decided to count the ceiling tiles to occupy myself, 4612 was the result. This was all before I could escape and eat my eye. Rock, paper, scissors was the highlight of the mind numbing 108 minutes of crap in which I spent trying to die. The plastic cups would not suffice as a blade. The popcorn failed to suffocate me, which caused this movie to even ruin popcorn for me. Anyone who likes this movie should be shot. I don't care how many abusive replies I get, it's crap. Watching this film was a waste of my life.\n",

I have done serious efforts to keep my eyes open during this movie.I regret the time I spent watching it. Worst that 1.0 which is a crap. The only movie I have seen which is worst that this movie is Ice Planet. The questions you put to yourself at the end of this movie are: 1. Where is Leonardo Di Caprio? 2.Is Jim Carrey suffering from a depression or a testicle neoplasm and decided to act in this movie? 3.Why don't I hear Celine Dion singing in this movie? 4. Didn't we all see Vanilla Sky and Butterfly effect?\n",

This is a Charles Kaufman movie, but you can feel that Spike Jonze is not directing it... And I think this is a terrible mistake. What is the message of this movie??? \"Love is forever\", \"Love is stronger than Life\", \"People can't forget the powerful feeling of love\"....Disgusting. These stupid sentences make me feel sick!.There are a lot of powerful images in this movie, but the message inside of them is so stupid that only border lines can't get it. It's all so obvious!. I think this is Gondry's fault. Because the others kaufman's films aren't so soft and sweet.The final is really bad...I recommend you not see this movie. You had better see Being John Malkovich.\n",

      "I have seen this movie after a couple of years because I am not very fond of Jim Carrey's theater of faces; so I tried to avoid him as much as I can. Finally, I found a good actor doing his job. Unfortunately, I also found a flat, fake, boring movie. Despite all of the favorable criticism, to me \"Eternal..\" is a corny love story decorated with pretentious elements, such as the editing. The director and writer have stolen son many little things of other great movies (particularily from Europe) that in America people could think this is an original stuff. That's understandable where even people who know about cinema do not know anything about movies from other countries. It's like a remake of a movie that has never been done. I am suspecting that audiences' memories are erased from time to time. This is the only way you think \"Eternal...\" is original. Should I choose a similar movie, I prefer by far \"Total Recall\" (Schwarzenegger - Verhoeven). This flick is pure joy, action and epic. America needs to find again it's own, strong voice again. Very fast.\n",

      "I normally watch films to the end, even if I don't like them, but sadly I couldn't go all the way with Eternal Sunhine. Anything seemed more interesting than this boring twaddle.As such, having not seen it all, I don't feel that I can write a proper review. But really, nothing there was to latch on to, nothing of interest. This is one of those films where I think people rate it highly just because it blatantly tries so hard and is odd because it can be.First of all there was some obvious jumping around going on, time wise, because events were out of order. It's really becoming a tired clich√© of cinema. And while it works wonderfully in some films (Closer, Mulholland Drive et al) I just felt it was complication for complication's sake in this film.But then what happens in this story? We have some teenagers wiping the lead character's memory while drinking his alcohol, smoking pot (ooh, how edgy) and larking about.I'm sorry. We're meant to believe in this story where people have their MEMORIES WIPED (i.e. messing around with their brains) and they let stoned kids do it? Yeah right, that's realistic. Ridiculous.Otherwise all that was happening was just flashes of the lead character's memories, which came across as one of those Star Trek episodes where one of the crew is being mentally invaded by some parasite or something, and the crew saves the crewmember in the end.In short pointless, nothing to draw me in and this DVD is going on eBay. Maybe I'm missing something, after all this is high in the top 250. But whereas many films deserve it, I can't see what people see in this film.\n",

If you ¬ñ director - I'm talking to you, thinking that you can get to success point only if you have Jim's Carrey face in you movie. It's wrong idea.! This movie is O.K., even no matter that it's really cheap movie. And few more points that you should pay attention too: age mach of your characters - like (Kate Winslet she play's young and naive girl around 20 years old, but she is not young ), and Jim Carrey looks too established in comedy type movies for Toyota Corolla, also film quality: grayish cheap picture it's not helps here. And that scene at the beginning, in the train is too long and becomes finally very boring. DVD cover for this movie, is one of the most terrible design I ever seen in my life. Good luck with your new movies.\n",

It has an interesting premise but I thought that what was done was very boring. I spent most of the time wondering how much longer it had to go. I don't know if you were supposed to figure out that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's character met again after they had their memories of each other erased, but I figured it out about 10 minutes into the film. From there, I was pretty much able to guess what would happen. I felt that Jim Carrey did do a good job acting. I just wish there had been less footage of him unconscious on the bed. I also felt that the antics of the technician and secretary were completely unnecessary to the plot.\n",

I do have imagination; I do have a tendency to think beyond the obvious but, but this movie really worked at being so - so, I can't really find the words. We are all struggling to find our identity. Give me a break. That's not a new theme but with a movie as convoluted as this, some poor souls will truly believe that this choppy, pretentious,artsy-craftsy movie is a work of art.

A sheer waste of 2 hours watching this piece of garbage.IMDb and Jim Carrey have now hit an all time low in my book (IMDB for the majority of awful reviewers that have given this movie such an unbelievably high rating).My advice here would be to not even consider watching it. If however you do end up doing so like I did, because of the unusually high rating, and if you get bored watching it half way through. Quit it, the story never picks up.

Well, that's why I decided to watch it. The problem is, the movie doesn't fulfil these promises at all. It is simply boring. You can guess the end of the story after the first half an hour. Basically, the idea was great, the implementation very poor. The problem are, for example, the moments showing the two employees dancing in their underwear, plenty of meaningless stories within the main plot and generally, the feeling of chaos. The acting is good, even the actor from Ace Ventura. I can't believe this movie got so much critical acclaim.3/10\n",

      "I don't know how to describe \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\" Clich√©, I know, but there doesn't seem to be words to describe just how exquisite a film I think it is. I feel like I shouldn't even comment on it because I can't do it justice. There don't seem to be enough adjectives, in any language, to describe how amazing a movie it truly is. But, I guess I have to begin somewhere. Eternal Sunshine is an indescribably marvelous film (isn't that an oxymoron? No, I think I'm probably the moron here,lol). It's a love story unlike any other I've seen before. It isn't filled with the typical Hollywood melodrama that so many so-called \"love stories\" possess where the perfect girl and the perfect guy love each other and want to be together, but they don't know it at first, and somehow, despite their perfection, they can't admit their true feelings until the end when they live happily ever after. Cue the doves flying into the sunset. Eternal Sunshine is nothing like that. It isn't the love story of two otherwise perfect people living in this ethereal and ideal world where the problems are so easily solved. It's a love story between real characters with real faults and flaws, quirks and idiosyncracies. Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are human. He's shy, timid, and introverted, she's outgoing, vivacious, but yet somehow broken and sad, unable to maintain a sense of normalcy and familiarity. Clementine becomes bored quite easily, and Joel is threatened when Clementine cannot be exactly what he wants her to be. He gets annoyed at her for the very same reasons he fell in love with her, and their relationship suffers as a result of their incapacity to be what the other needs, and to keep their romance fresh. Clementine opts to undergo a new procedure to have her memories of Joel wiped clean, and he has to come to terms with that and decide if he really wants to erase her from her memories. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, so I'll wrap it up here. You'll fall in love with them both. So, watch it because it's a great story, it doesn't have a linear plot but you will be mesmerized by the acting and the vivid visuals and the overall beautiful cinematography of the film. This film has left me with Eternal Sunshine of my Spotless Mind.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is one of those movies that signifies its strangeness by having the opening credits come quite a way into the movie (a la \"Alias\"). If nothing else, it lives up to the mindset it promises, although I have to admit I don't love this movie as much as others do; director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman have certainly delivered a clever and touching tale... but it's a bit too much of the former and a bit short on the latter.The movie's biggest problem is that Jim Carrey (cast against type as an introverted nice guy) and Kate Winslet (as a woman who we know is a free spirit - though a troubled one - because she keeps changing her hair colour) don't really seem like they are or ever were a couple, even allowing for opposites attracting. This doesn't ruin the movie's effect, but it does make it seem a bit remote, especially as their relationship is seen almost entirely from his point of view. Remember, there are two sides to every story, and although we do eventually see her side of it, the real added dimension comes from Kirsten Dunst as the receptionist at the company that performs the mind-wiping that triggers the plot. She seems surplus to requirements at first, but it turns out that she's there to do more than dance on a bed in a T-shirt and panties.This is one of the movie's main strengths (not Kirsten Dunst in a T-shirt and panties*); everything proves to have something else going on under the surface, including the structure of the movie itself. The constant unpredictability and the conviction of Carrey's performance as the man on an adventure inside his own mind makes it more than the exercise in cleverness for cleverness's sake that it could have been - the movie never forgets that it's a romance at heart. Jon Brion's wonderful score (which is almost another character in the movie) is another plus; so is Tom Wilkinson as the doctor in charge, and so are Dunst, Winslet, Mark Ruffalo and even Elijah Wood.But though funny, ingenious and even a little touching, in the end \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a feelgood movie for people who like to think they're too smart to be caught at feelgood movies; I like it, certainly, but I can't help wondering if this is one of those movies that viewers of a certain kind SAY you should love, rather than something you can take to your hearts of your own accord. Either way, it deserves a second viewing, and there aren't many Jim Carrey that even merit one.*Which is not to say that's a bad thing, mind.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine is a movie worth forgetting.  I looked at my watch 10 times, wanting the movie to end.  I stayed to the bitter end, but there were 40 lucky people who left the movie early.  Jim Carrey plays a man who discovers that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their relationship erased from her mind.  He goes to the doctor to have the same procedure of erasing her memories from his mind.  We get to see each memory of their relationship as they are erased from his mind.  The only good thing I got out of the movie is that it makes you think about how important our memories are to us.  However, I wouldn't mind erasing this movie from my memory.

      "It truly is a shame that moviegoers these days are ignorant, misinformed, and searching for something that isn't there. Charlie Kaufman is no genius. He is a mainstream, large-budget writer/director who creates films that appear independent and artsy and original... but by nature, they are just the opposite, and he makes a lot of money. His movies, and I'm not sure if Adaptation or ESOTSM is worse, are disjointed and pretentious. His dialogue begs for reality, and he creates movies with the hopes of forcing the viewer to feel something. News flash Kaufman, you can't force people to feel something. And the people you do force, they don't have minds or opinions or the experience to know different. It makes me sick that those who see this film will believe they now understand the art and culture of the indie film... THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Please, can we inform and educate our public of true movies, movies that don't have huge budgets, star A-list actors who are dying for a mainstream film disguised as a indie phenomenon, and pretend to be something they are not. It is insulting and embarassing, and those who enjoyed this film because it was \"beautiful\" and \"meaningful\" and \"unlike anything else\" and \"artsy\" should dig a hole and bury themselves in it. Worthless creatures.\n",

      "ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004) *** Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Jane Adams, David Cross. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman once again baffles the mind and logic of cinema with another patented loopy love story set on end this time with a sad sack (Carrey) who discovers his ex-girlfriend (Winslet) has had a procedure done to literally erase all memory of his existence which prompts him into a spontaneous spiteful choice to do likewise with unexpected circumstances to crop up, namely love is a powerful thing to try to forget. Filmmaker Michel Gondry (who adapted Kaufman's equally goofy 'Human Nature') manages to technically get the feel for a second rate sci-fi appeal to the film with some unique camera trickery but there is scarcely any believable chemistry between the two principals (maybe that's the point? If so then it works) ¬ñ not to dismiss their excellent turns here; it just felt like something was missing to make it an instant classic.\n",

      "The screenplay is undoubtedly smart and imaginative, with a quite interesting and fun premise on memory erasure. However, the movie is not executed well, particularly in the storytelling. The nonlinear storytelling is just unnecessary, making the movie chaotic and confusing.

I recommend this film for those who like something deeper and darker. This film made me to think about it almost a week! I was amazed with this movie. Most Hollywood films tell us we have everything we need within ourselves. This movie indicates that we need each other, even ... when togetherness disrupts happiness. I like the idea of this film.

This movie is so miserable, it is literally painful to watch. For this movie to be so highly rated, it says some very disturbing things about our society. Have we all become a bunch of losers so that losers are the only thing we can identify with? Only pathetic Homer Simpsons appeal to us?

      "Back in 1999, Charlie Kaufman wrote the film Being John Malkovich. Which was my favorite film of 1999. Also, it was like no film I will ever see. That film was unique and funny also. Now in 2004, Kaufman has written the film Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, which isn't quite as good but is almost as good. Eternal sunshine is unique, funny, and like no film I will ever see in my entire life. The film has a great cast and a great twist in the end of the film. I am not going to get too into this film but I will give you the basic plot. Jim Carrey stars a Joel, a guy who realizes that his girlfriend Clementine(Played by Kate Winslet) is having an affair. So he goes under this procedure to erase her from his memory. She has already done it also. I am not going to say anything else about the films plot because I want you to see it for yourself. Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind was one of my favorite films of 2004. It's unique, funny, strange, and I will never see anything like it. I give Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind a big thumbs up. Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind:****/****\n",

      "Wow... this had me spellbound. Deep, intimate piece. If one wasn't already convinced that Jim Carrey is an actor, not just a comedian, one would be so after taking this in. Winslet does incredible, as well(and both are playing against type), as does everyone else that I can think of(Dunst also impressed me). You have to pay attention during this, and a second viewing may help, but it's not so abstract and loose that it's difficult to understand. This is the third work of Charlie Kaufman's that I've seen(the other two are Being John Malkovich and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), and by far my favorite. Anyone who has ever loved can relate to this. I can't promise it'll be pleasant, in fact, it's possible that it won't, but this is absolutely absorbing. This is mature, smart and does not try to distance itself, or its audience, from the subject matter. I haven't seen any other work by Gondry, but he directs this magnificently. Masterful visuals, and somehow apparently with little to no CGI. The editing and camera-work are excellent. Story-telling and characterization are of such high quality that I'm not sure words can do them justice. The ambiguity of the final moments is perfect. All of the special effects are amazing. The movie pulls you in, it is thoroughly engaging throughout. I'm not sure any viewer can avoid being affected by this. You may not recognize every scene as something from your own life, but the feelings, the impressions... they're universal. I don't remember when I've last been this into a big screen experience. Anyone who can watch films that are personal, and emotionally powerful should consider this. There is some strong language and sexual content, as well as drug references and the like. The DVD holds two featurettes, one of which I will review on its own page here on the site, interesting deleted scenes, a fake commercial, a music video, and an informative commentary track with the Michel and writer Charlie Kaufman, all of them also well worth your time. I recommend this to anyone who is or has been in a relationship, and who don't need their cinematic experiences spoon-fed. 10/10\n",

      "\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\" - Alexander Pope Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliantly heartfelt and complicated tale that delves, rather flawlessly, into the labyrinth of human emotions and the pain often involved in trying to make a relationship work. Charlie Kaufman, the main writer behind Eternal Sunshine, often allows his ingenuity and talent to infuse the film with perfectly subtle touches of emotion and humanity. His understanding of relationships and the variety of complexities involved is often wondrous to behold. One day, Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), after falling in love with Clementine (Kate Winslet), finds out that she, due to her recent unhappiness with the relationship, had Joel erased from her memory through a procedure carried out by the Lacuna company. Eventually, Joel, himself, wants the same operation, in order that he can forget Clementine as well. Through this procedure, the film delves into Joel's thoughts and past, chaotically revealing his memories as he eventually attempts to outrun the erasing of them, after realizing how much the lovely moments with Clementine rather largely outweighed the upsetting ones.The cast, from Kirsten Dunst to Jim Carrey, is superb in the portrayal of their characters. In one of his more dynamic roles, Jim Carrey presents Joel Barrish as a complex and three-dimensional character, and seems wholly convincing and sympathetic throughout. Clementine is played absolutely brilliantly by Kate Winslet. Her on-screen chemistry with Carrey is thoroughly entrancing and poignant. The entirety of the supporting cast deliver a subliminally nuanced and engrossing blend of emotions as well.The apparent surrealism deftly blends with the realism in a way that allows the viewer a more complete view of the tale. This subtle relationship between the director, the writer, and the screen is enhanced and brought to life with the assistance of the exceptional cinematography and the seamless transitions and edits. The feelings and expressions throughout the film cast a picture so hauntingly realistic, it's difficult not to see some aspect of a past relationship unfolding on-screen. The engaging and creative ways Gondry and Kaufman explore Joel's memories and dreams is humorous, chaotic, touching, and heartbreaking all at once. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a consistently moving and thought-provoking film that remains my favorite film of all time. Simply perfect.\n",

      "Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have crafted the best love story of the new millennium so far. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind tells the timeless tale of falling in and out of love, of meeting one's kindred soul and of overcoming adversities in the pursuit of happiness. But the filmmakers tell it in a mind-bending, mixing everyday emotions with elegant plays on time, narrative and memory.Jim Carrey, in one of his best performances, plays Joel, an everyman who discovers his unstable, unpredictable, but captivating girlfriend, Clementine (possibly Kate Winslet's best role) has just erased him from his memory through a new scientific process invented by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). In revenge, he decides to erase her too. But as the process unfolds, he realises that even his most painful memories are a treasure worth cherishing; so in his mind, he fights the process.In spite of all the fantasy in this movie, I don't think I've ever seen a relationship so well portrayed in cinema. Joel and Clem aren't just characters, there's something very familiar in them, which any viewer can find in themselves. They're imperfect, impulsive, sometimes unlikeable. But nevertheless love finds a way through them.Kate Winslet was spectacular in her role, but Carrey is the real surprise. Every once in a while he surprises people with a great performance: The Truman Show; Man On The Moon. He plays grief, tenderness and shyness so well in this movie I wish he'd get more dramatic roles.Few movies are as emotional and honest like The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Many love stories come from Hollywood, with their perfect love stories, where everything turns out well; but this is the rare movie in which love has but a temporary victory so it must be enjoyed while it lasts, in which downbeat ending can still be uplifting. How is that possible? I guess that's why Gondry and Kaufman are hailed as geniuses.\n",

      "I usually only review movies that just came out but I just saw this film last night and it struck me in an odd way so I decided to review it. One of my judges of a good movie that you find yourself thinking about the film several days after seeing it, I saw this film like 8 hours ago and I'm convinced I won't get it out of my head for the rest of the week. In fact this movie had such a weird profound effect on me I took a walk after seeing it just to get it clear in my head, and you know what consolation I came to while walking, this film is not as good as it's first impression's make it seem.Oh don't get me wrong Eternal Sunrise is a good film, by many standards, but it pulls of the cleaver trick of being so weird that you automatically assume it's amazingly good. Vanilla Sky pulled the same trick, but I saw it for the piece of crap it was. This film is better than Vanilla Sky, but not better than say 12 Monkeys.After my mind swam through the weirdness I came to some realizations about this film. One is that it is a Romance; I know Wikipedia says it's a Science Fiction Neo-Surrealist, but it's a Romance. And my main judge for a good romance is, do you fall in love with the girl as much as the main character does? And for this film the answer to this is a resounding no. I know all guys are into different \"Types\" of girls but there are some qualities in women that most men like and incorporating those into one \"ultimate girl package\" is in many ways the job of Romances (innless you're a girl reading this then it's the \"ultimate guy package\"). One of the reasons why I liked Yes Man so much was because Zooey Deschanel's character pulled this off so well, hell I still have a crush on her after seeing that movie. But you have to be delicate about this, if you try too hard to create \"Mega Girlfriend\" then the audience realizes what you're up to and the allusion is broken. This happened in There's Something About Mary, I really couldn't stand that film because Mary was so unrealistically appealing that I felt like meting Gandalf the Gray was more likely than meting her.Anyway the Point I am getting at here is that Kate Winslet's character has the right idea, as far as being universally appealing, but takes it too far. Thought there are many different kinds of \"Mega Girls\" one of the most popular forms is the \"Lively Spontaneous Girl\" and this is clearly what the movie is shooting for with Kate Winslet. But instead of being lively and spontaneous in a cute fun way, she overdoes it and comes off more like one of those weird smelly girls who works at Spencer's Gifts. OK I'll admit maybe the guy writing this film was going for that, but I doubt it. In fact most of the characters in this film aren't very likable, and beyond that they're almost impossible to identify with. Jim Carey is supposed to be shy and aloof, but to me he comes off more as needy and cowardly. The only real character I liked was one of the films apparent Antagonists, who I would give more info about if it didn't mean risking spoilers.But despite this flaw Eternal Sunrise is a movie worth seeing if only for the experience of it. Though the characters suck the actors playing them do a good job, unlike a lot of weird films it does a pretty good job of explaining itself to the audience, and if you can manage to understand the ending (which is hard) it's an extremely satisfying one. It's a good weird film just with some nasty looking smudges one it that I wanted to point out.\n",

      "Films that intentionally blur the lines between the real and the imagined, that completely defy our most basic sense of narrative structure can often be off-putting and regarded as strange. Some people, no matter how outside-the-box their thinking, will always see \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" this way. The title alone is a red flag for conservative movie-goers. But the truth is that this film is not abstract merely for the sake of style, but it is abstract filmmaking with a clear purpose. Writer Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry make that purpose accessible the entire film and the result is a unique and special film about the connection between memory and relationship.\"Eternal Sunshine\" is about the relationship between Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet), both of whom have decided to undergo a procedure that would completely erase the other from his/her memory. The majority of plot follows Joel as he seeks out the services of Lacuna, a practice run by a doctor (Wilkinson) and his staff (Ruffalo, Dunst and Wood). As they erase his memory overnight, the film plunges into a progression from most recent to earliest of all of Joel's memories involving Clementine. Things are complicated when a mostly unconscious Joel decides, while in his own memories, that he has changed his mind.As Joel goes through his memories, things disappear, his environment magically shifts from one to the next. Some of this is digital effects, but much of it is nifty camera-work. It's hard to understand exactly what's going on, but since the action takes place in Joel's mind, what happens is a mix of Joel's actual memory and his mind's interaction with it. It's a brilliant and surreal trip through someone's mind that exposes more and more about this relationship as it goes, also asking questions along the way about whether erasing someone is ultimately an effective way of dealing with loss.It's a pleasure seeing Carrey take on dramatic role successfully. He seems to be able to channel his goofy energy into the neurotic and self-conscious Joel. Winslet proves her own versatility in taking on Clem, who is a free-spirited fireball, not her traditional dramatic performance, but she really demands your attention. Wilkinson and Dunst also prove to be excellent dramatic side-fodder to illustrate another perspective into the memory erasing concept.Excellent, realistic character portrayal combined with surreal visual drama create a concept of love that while abstract, manages to identify with us because there's a wild, imaginative side of love that only exists in our individual minds. Through the entire film, Gondry makes sure we see the very high and very low points of a relationship and it creates a feeling that Joel and Clementine are meant for each other despite obvious proof that they are somewhat incompatible. This helps further push the film's themes.While \"Eternal Sunshine\" can get confusing and test one's limits at times, a concentrated viewing will show how honest and truthful this film is to not only human relationships, but to the human psyche.\n",

After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.This is a movie that makes you think and could break your heart at the same time. It's your different kind of romantic comedy and it's a great addition to Charlie Kaufman's writing. The great work of CGI and camera work draws in the viewers because they are so amazing!

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (cool title taken from Alexander Pope's poem \"Eloisa to Abelard\") is one of the most original, hilarious and oddly moving films about love and all its phases. Thanks to Charlie Kaufman's flawless, much deserving Oscar-winning script (co-written by Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth), and Gondry's spectacular visual talent, ESOTSM became a one of a kind masterpiece. Take Paul Thomas Anderson's gorgeous \"Punch-Drunk Love\", which features the overwhelming sensation of falling in love among chaos and depression, and go deeper, when the perfect couple don't feel so into each other anymore and their ugly side is evident, and you can have an idea of what expect from the V-Day card created by the same mind who gave us \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation.\".Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) discovers that his beloved Clementine Kruczysnki (Kate Winslet) underwent a bizarre procedure to erase him from her mind, and decides to do the same. But only after the physicians start to erase his memories, Joel realizes he loves Clem so much that he wants to remember both the good and bad times they had together - so our hero has to run with Clem from the doctors (inside his mind!) and struggle to stop them before everything's gone. Sounds crazy? It is. It's also extremely funny and poignant. Who never wanted to forget the one who broke our heart? What if you could really do it? Now, the hardest thing to know is whether it's worth it or not. A discreet Carrey and a garrulous Winslet are fantastic as the leads, and the supporting cast (Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, David Cross and Jane Adams) is equally brilliant.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is compelling for those who have just had their first heartbreak, AND for those who consider themselves experts in matters of the heart as well. It seems that (at least to me), when it comes to love and relationships, the more we seem to understand them, the less we really know about them.

It's not that I only like romantic comedies or action flicks or whatever other kind of film that fans of this kind of movie think of as lowbrow. It's that I just couldn't make myself care about the characters. I didn't care if they got back together, I didn't care if they erased each other, I didn't like them, and I couldn't identify with them (never having, say, consumed illicit substances or been promiscuous, which sometimes seemed to be the two major activities depicted here).The premise is interesting, and goes back to Shakespeare and before with the whole 'better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all' bit. The pace and 'feel' was a bit too frenetic for my tastes, although I can see how it would appeal to a lot of people (it felt like watching the beginning of _Moulin Rouge_, a film I enjoy immensely except for the first fifteen minutes, for an hour and a half). Kate Winslet was brilliant, and Jim Carrey was, well, Jim Carrey, which is not bad, I suppose.

I have seen most of the nominated movies, and while I did enjoy a few in particular (and some I just don't see what all the fuss is about), I have to say that Eternal sunshine surpassed many other films this year. Even if you weren't a huge fan of it, it's hard to deny the immense creativity and imagination that went into the creation of this film. But it didn't come of cheesy, it was beautiful and so well executed. I have never seen anything so visually close to what my dreams and memories look like in my head. How could not get a nod for art direction? As for Kate Winslet's nomination, it doesn't come to much as a surprise to me. She is a very talented actress and this role was no exception. But what about Mr. Carrey? In my humble opinion, I truly think this is one of the best performances he has ever given, and I've seen pretty much all his movies. I admit, I am a fan, but that doesn't hinder the fact that his usual antics were gone and replaced with another side of him we haven't seen, even in other more drama oriented movies such as the Truman Show. And I'm not just saying and actor who changes up their roles a bit should be nominated. However, his performance was so true and pure and real. I know that guy. I know Joel, we all do. We have seen him sitting lonely in some public place. We have seen that guy who has insecurities so heavy they slow him down when he walks. He was so real, even in a movie that can arguably be considered a fantasy or sci-fi piece. And that's another thing about this movie: while there is no category for this, this movie refreshed the often boring genre of a love story. It was an almost bizarre idea with a love story at the core. And despite the fantasy aspects of it, it was a more real love story than some others I have seen. I don't usually post about these matters because I feel that it doesn't change anything and all it does is cause internet arguments, but I felt the need to say something about this, as one movie lover, to others.\n",

I do not know how it won awards- it's terrible. made no sense, i hated the characters and everyone acted unnaturally. I mean HELLO- people have their memories wiped for a reason and telling them what they've forgotten would never cause a mental breakdown. I hope you realise i'm being sarcastic. And Kate was supposed to be funny and quirky she wasn't. It was a brilliant idea for a film but was made horribly. I don't know why this film has such a high rating. Avoid no matter what. I saw this with some friends and they all agreed. It tries so hard to be 'artsy' and 'original' but fails. Just don't see this film please. In short: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!\n",

      "After watching good movies with the \"memory\" stuff such as Paycheck and Butterfly effect, I thought, this movie would be a good way to pass a weekend evening - but boy, it royally spoiled my weekend.THe movie has no storyline to tell - it is just a collage of absurd events pasted together - making no sense. The photography is even worse, as if done by an amature video-photographer. I do not understands the directors fascination with close-ups and profiles and poor lighting. It adds to the viewers woes, who is already tortured by a non-existent storyline.No wonder, the movie is doing poorly at box-office. I saw people walking out of the movie in between. The auditorium was empty barring the last 3-4 rows.Avoid it - unless you are an art-movie buff\n",

      "As i have said before on more than one occasion ,I'm not a big Jim Carey fan. When i have mentioned this in the past there is always one person who says \" but have you seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\"? Well i hadn't up until now and what i am going to say about it is bound to upset a few people.Joel is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak , to have Clementine removed from his memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier passion. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get her out of his head.Firstly there is nothing wrong with Jim Carey in this film . In fact it's refreshing to see him not pulling stupid faces. I enjoyed the acting of Kate Winslett too but the film itself left me cold.Looking at IMDb.com nearly everyone gives this top marks and it's listed as the the 59th best movie of all time. I don't get it? Is there something profound in this film that i missed? The idea is a good one but the execution is not. I found the timeline extremely confusing and the conclusion unsatisfactory. Perhaps my expectations were to high? I was expecting something special but i ended up getting a film that was trying to be far to clever for it's own good.It reminded me a little of Being John Malkovich. That too was pretentious nonsense and yet everyone praised it . Not Me. It's like the Emperors new clothes story . Once one person jumps up and say \" I love it\" everyone jumps on the band wagon.If i had the telephone number of the memory eraser's i would call them to erase my memory of this movie.To sum up i found Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a self indulgent mess and if that upsets people i make no apologies for my honesty.4 out of 10\n",

WASTED! if you have not seen this movie, don't. it is boring and queer! I hated this movie not because it had nudity and other crap, but because it was boring, and it must have been inspired by a sleeping pill or some piece of crap... the worst 2 ways to see this movie would be: #1: set a guy/girl night. #2: see it in theaters. I was woken up by my friend brad.

I can think of not one scene in this confusing mish=mash of a film that was entertaining. Instead of entertaining, in fact it was a strain to watch. Granted, it is well made, but that doesn't make up for the fact that the filmmaker should give the audience someone to care about in their story. While Carrey and Winslet are good in their roles, we just don't care what happens to them. I had a very similar reaction to the last Kaufman film that I endured(barely), \"Being John Malkovich\" I'm almost to the point of doing the opposite of what the critics recommend, in light of the fact that this garbage was almost universally acclaimed. What is amazing is that this film scores so highly by the IMDb members. I haven't spoken to anyone who remotely enjoyed \"spotless\"\n",

Also, who said you have to be good looking to be a movie star??? They both look ghastly! Kate Winslet seriously needs to have something done about her nose - but I guess that has nothing to do with the movie itself...All in all it was a depressing, pointless flick.\n",

Being the only couple in the theatre gave my wife and I advance notice of this disaster.  I did sit through the entire movie, which was the worst two hours of my life.

It reminded me of the Blair Witch Project - which at least was interesting aside from the camera shaking.I understood the premise of erasing memories and Joel's desire to hold onto the memories after committing to have them erased. But why all of the pointless, disjointed scenes?Unfortunately, I stuck it out and watched to the end, but was upset at myself for staying.  My husband didn't understand it and was smart enough to fall asleep during most of it.  I left with a very sick headache and again, I was upset that I was so stupid to sit through it.

And by the amount of swearing, I'd say - anything but.No, there's no mind either - except when erasing its memory (they should had done that to me, to forget I ever saw this one).So what is in this movie? Well, 2 people. Poor in every department, including their minds. The anti-example at its most, with a large sign all over them (if you are able to read it): DON'T YOU EVER BE LIKE ME. And Hollywood thinks that we should be touched by them falling in love with each other, somewhere among all the bad words and foolish thoughts, bearing no interest whatsoever not only to any (even slightly) educated human, but to any AVERAGE (and even much below average) human anywhere.Now, naming this movie with such a name tells everything not about the movie (as we already established that) but about its makers. Twisted, profoundly sick minds must they have, indeed. Fit for this post-modern (read: post-any-values) world, and they're the hard workers of it.

      "Caught this last night. I ask those proclaiming Charlie Kaufman The Second Coming to remember the card sent to Joel's friends asking them to not tell him Clementine had him zapped. Seeing him again neither re-triggers her memory or fries her brain, so what possible reason is there NOT to tell him? And what about the woman with the mementos of her dead dog? Do these \"geniuses\" send out cards informing Buster's pals that his mistress has had him zapped, so please don't mention it to him? It's the stupidest plot device I've seen in ages!The nature of the sub-conscious is never explored, or how memory is intertwined with thought, or how the most random sight, smell or touch can trigger the most deep-seated memory. We not only dream of people (and pets) no longer a part of our lives, but of people we've never met. How do you zap that? And what happens if a person somehow reconnects with what they had zapped? Kaufman doesn't even begin to address any of this.He then trots out his trademark Twits Behaving Badly: the minions raid Joel's fridge, smoke pot, and dance on his bed with the stereo full blast; Mary tries to seduce Stan; Patrick swipes Joel's gift for Clementine so he can score with her; the Doctor zaps Mary's memory so his wife won't find out they've been playing doctor! Yuk, yuk!Kaufman also has a serious problem with women: Clementine, as are most of his heroines, is a total wack job who should never be allowed to reproduce, and Joel (a passive-aggressive wuss if ever there was one) shouldn't apologize for stating the obvious. After all, relationships are supposed to be based on honesty, especially when the truth hurts!\n",

It really just didn't have the cinephotagraphy that I expected and the plot wasn't very good (I know that that's what everybody's saying was the best part; I beg to differ). Also, I hate how this movie was advertised to be a comedy. Especially with Jim Carry (although I have to admit he did a great job in the crossover). I thought this would be more like a thing where the main character played by Jim Carry loses every memory of everything bad that ever happened to him and so he walks the streets like an idiot thinking nothing bad's ever going to happen. So, I was geared up for a comedy and got more of an abstract type of film. Prehaps it was all in the advertising.\n",

It ONLY strikes my interest at the end because it actually comes back to the story.How long can one watch fast-paced, dizzy, dream-sequences of two people that barely get along, only to have one of them disappear and then re-appear in another place, then starting all over again in another setting?Someone earlier compared this to Mulholland.

      "I heard a lot people talk about this movie. Many of my friends recommended it to me. But for different reasons I couldn't find any opportunity to watch it or ¬Ö",
      " may be I just didn't want to spend my time on it. But some weeks ago I heard again the name of this movie and I told to myself I had to watch it. So, I finally did it. And now I feel so disappointed with myself I didn't watch it years ago when I was told to see it for the first time! I am really impressed by this film.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an exceptional romantic drama. I am saying exceptional because for me it looks more like a romantic psychological thriller because the main idea of this movie is centered, let's say, on the psychology of two main characters Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). Or I even would say, the movie shows the fight between the rational aspect of human nature and the emotional one. Watching the Joel and Clementine's story you understand that not always the rational is right. You can ignore your mind, but you can't ignore your heart and what it is telling you and your heart usually tells right things. Well, the plot of the movie is very simple: two different personalities Joel and Clementine meet each other, they fall in love, then they become a nice couple, they have great time together, but then this beautiful story comes to its end. And instead of talking and trying to find a way to amend their relations, they decide to erase all the memories related to each other. Clementine was the first to take such decision. So, she went to Lacuna, Inc., company dedicating to helping people to erase specific memories and let them start new happier life. When Joel knew about this, he decided to do the same, as a revenge, and went to the same doctor Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). And here is where the story starts. The whole movie represents the process of erasure of Joel's memories. So, when you watch the movie, it feels like you are inside of his mind observing his love story with Clementine. But suddenly he realizes he wants to conserve these memories, he doesn't want to lose her because she is the love of his life and starts to stop the erasure. All his attempts fail when Dr. Howard interferes and finishes this process. Along with this story appears another one. It results Mary, receptionist had an affair with Dr. Howard and her memories about it were also erased. When she knew that, she quit her job and stole all the records on doctor's patients and sent those materials to all of them. This is the moment when Joel and Clementine, after listening to their records, understood why they felt so familiar to each other and decide to try to start from the beginning.You see, the story is pretty simple. But the way it's operated, the way how different stories and different realities cross each other is incredible. Sometimes you even lose the touch with the reality because you think all this is Joel's memories and imagination. Thanks to such s great script and director's work, the movie is watched in one breath, you feel tension and you are totally absorbed by the story. Also, I would like to note the brilliant performance of Jim Carrey. I always thought he could perform only comic roles. But here he shows his abilities to play serious roles too. Honestly, I was shocked by his excellent performance. I believed him from the very beginning of the film till its end.So, now it's my turn to recommend this movie! If you want to live the story with its main characters, if you want to convince yourself one more time that you can't lie to your heart, so this movie is right for you. You will definitely enjoy it, or at least you will see another not typical Jim Carrey and original movie story.\n",

      " is Kaufman's masterpiece about relationships, memories, reality, and about intolerance, impatience, inability to listen to the others, to understand them. How easy it is to insult the one you love the most. How difficult it is to forgive yourself for that. How often we rely on the modern technology to fix our inner problems. How seldom we realize that painful and happy memories go together. You can not get rid of ones and keep the others. It may not be the best romance film ever but it is damn close. It is a tender and poignant Valentine Card that Kaufman sent to all of us ¬ñ to remind us that the love exists, that relationships can survive, and even if they die, we have the memories of them, and nobody or nothing can take our memories from us. Is it just a coincidence that Kaufman references for the second time to the tragic and great love of Eloisa and Abelard in his works? I applaud to Michel Gondry for his brilliant directing; to the supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet played their best roles ever and I hope to see Carrey more often in the dramatic performances. But in the beginning of everything there was a word ¬ñ without Kaufman's screenplay the film would not have happened. Thank you, Charlie.\n",

Together they've made movies like, Being John Malchovich and Adaptation...both of which I like very much. But Eternal Sunshine was done in a way that captivated me. It was a movie that really opened my eyes, a movie that made you think. It is like a maze that you eventually finish at the end of the movie. This movie is number one on my list. In this movie we see Jim Carrey's best acting since The Truman Show. We also see Kate Winslet(its been awhile)perform amazingly. Truly.....this is the next Casablanca in my opinion.\n",

      "****spoilers ahead*****Eternal Sunshine is an interesting concept, and it's by no means a bad film. It's entertaining and, I admit it, a break from the average rom-com (a genre I usually avoid at all costs). It's enjoyable, with reasonably strong acting and some originality. But Eternal Sunshine just isn't as amazing as the buzz suggests, and certainly doesn't deserve to be in the imdb top 50. There are many many movies better than this one.Before fans leap on me, it's not that I haven't understood the plot, or that I don't like complicated movies. (for a start, Mulholland Drive is one of my favourites, and if that's not confusing, I don't know what is). It's just that this particular film is more complicated than it needs to be, and what is a fresh and interesting starting point gets lost in the midst of everything else. And I lay the blame firmly at the feet of Charlie Kaufman.Being John Malkovich was a masterpiece, but since then, I think the praise has gone to Kaufman's head. He's setting out with each script to produce some quirky film that will get him the pat on the head he got from BJM. With this, as with Adaptation, he detracts from the core of the plot (which is often brilliant) by trying to just be too clever. He does weird stuff for weirdness sake. For instance, the blurred out faces in some scenes. It's shown in the film that when people are erased, they just vanish. So why the no-face people? It's like he thought, hey, wouldn't it be freaky if we did that?This isn't like Memento, it's more like the bit when John Malkovich goes into his own head. The friend I went with said she didn't find it romantic, 'just a bit creepy', and that she didn't like either Joel or Clem. I admit I found Clem in particular very annoying at times with her 'kooky' ways. On the other hand, another friend loved it and declared she was going to dye her hair red because it looked cool on Clem, so maybe it's each to their own.The acting is reasonably good, but then we know Carrey and Winslet are good. They've done it before. That's no surprise, and they are capable of better performances than they give in this film. Kate Winslet does not deserve an Oscar, and neither does Carrey.The mixed up scenes are a nice touch, with the bed in the snow or the rain in the living room, and so is the idea of bringing Clem into other memories. But the idea that the couple need to be more intimate with one another emotionally is a bit cliched for what this film is trying to do. It's a cop out.By all means, go and watch this film if you have some free time. It's enjoyable. But it's not one to drop everything and run to the cinema for.\n",

      "The best excuse to see the film is the tour de force acting by Jim Carrey. He is paid millions to appear in other films that are supposed to be funny movies, but in reality, Mr. Carrey is at top of his craft when he plays against type, as is the case in this film.That Mr. Carrey is surrounded by some of the best actors working in films today, helps to make this  movie a favorite for a lot of IMDB contributors, judging by the hundreds of comments submitted to this page. Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, are very good and very effective in playing the people in the story.As far as the writing of Charlie Kaufman goes, he is never boring. To every new project Mr. Kaufman brings his own fresh ideas on how to present them on screen. He is very lucky to have found directors that are sensitive to his material and do the job well. To have Michael Gondry bring it all together, it's just happiness.The only point I would argue with Mr. Kaufman is the suppression of those painful memories at the center of the story. It is utopian at best. Would anyone be better off by having a bad love affair, or even a death of a loved one, erased from one's mind permanently? I think not. I'd rather remember the good and the bad.\n",

Finally i woke up around the time the movie ended and what i see is JIM and KATE are back together,proving that if you want to, you can beat system.They both needed to go through the costly and risky processes of getting their memory erased to realise that they still love each other.

I wasn't too keen on the construction, the way the film is constantly toing and froing between scenes, scenarios and characters. I almost felt like the filmmakers were trying to be too smart and would have preferred it if the story would have been told simply.That said, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are highly convincing as couple Joel and Clementine.

Directed by Michel Gondry, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind follows Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) who finds out that his girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) has erased him from her memory thanks to Lacuna, Inc., an innovative company that ensures customers will get their undesirable memories deleted. Joel learns that the reason behind this is because his ex is currently not happy with their relationship. Heartbroken by her action, Joel decided to go through the same procedure to ease his pain only to realize that there are also those memories that are worth keeping. The premise sounds promising enough, and the way the movie was executed was mesmerizing. Written with such originality by Charlie Kaufman (the credits also go to Pierre Bismuth and Gondry himself), the story was brought onto screen by Gondry with creativity and satisfaction. Gondry was deft when it comes to realizing sci-fi elements in the script on screen without looking superficial or unrealistic. Gondry also employed the non-linear narrative style to convey the story, rendering the movie ambiguous yet remarkable and effective especially when it comes to the memory scenes in which the procedure works by erasing the latest memory to the earliest. Such filmic technique constitutes the heart and soul of the film.Joel becomes hesitant about the procedure once he relives his memories and at one point in the film, he even decides to call it quit in order to keep the good memories with Clementine. He then tries to escapes with Clementine by running off the map the erasure team has created in Joel's brain as part of the process, thus disrupting it. The cinematography in many of these sequences was visually impressive with some cool camera tricks (e.g., forced perspective to realize the kitchen scenes where Joel travels back to his four-year-old self). Some minor special effects, editing, and creative mise-en-sc√®ne were employed in a way that create some of the most bizarre scenes in the film. The score by Jon Brion fits in with the tone of the film perfectly. Some of the pieces were just beautiful. The acting couldn't have been better, especially from the two leads who gave the performances of their lifetimes. Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet shared a great chemistry together. Carrey injected so much life to his character and was surprisingly remarkable and entertaining as Joel and deserved an Oscar nomination for this. He did the comedic scenes as well as the dramatic ones in the film. Winslet was a breath of fresh air as Clementine and shone in her role as Clementine. She brought her character to screen with spontaneity, vitality and charisma. It is completely understandable why Joel loves Clem so much. The supporting cast does not go unnoticed. Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst were a lot of fun to watch. Tom Wilkinson was fine as Dr. Mierzwiak, who plays an important role for the plot. The backstory and revelation of his character becomes a poignant twist that serves to question the idea of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind succeeded in combining drama with comedy and sci-fi. It's not pretty nor sugar-coated in its approach, but surreal and bizarre that results in a powerful emotional ride and delight of the film. The movie will stand the test of time as being one of the most creative and original story ever written and made.\n",

      "This is probably my favorite movie ever, so obviously i only have good things to say about it. it's gotten to the point where i look at people who say they dislike it with a disbelief expression on my face. With the exception of cases where the person really disliked it for reasons whatsoever, i would say one big turn-off for the first time viewer is the complexity of the movie, the various changes (space/time-wise) and levels through which the story leads us. Here's one tip: try to follow Clem's hair colors, they are basically the greatest element of orientation for us. Of course, only after a number of viewings you're going to realize that, no point trying to rush things. By the way, for people who like puzzling characters and story lines, this is a handful, every time you watch it, there's something new to discover. And, speaking of the characters..to me, Joel and Clementine are already featured on the list of one of the best couples ever to hit the screen. They're like water and oil, and yet, they're the perfect yin and yang for each other, clich√© and true. Clementine is often labeled as a so-called \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\", but i don't agree at all. I won't go into detail of the meaning of the term, but Clementine is so special and unique that i don't think she is fit for any labels, quoting Joel: \"I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane\". Kate Winslet gives the best performance of her career, so far. Jim Carrey, too, is nothing short of spectacular, he is surprisingly comfortable in the role of an introverted and shy man, defying all judgments we may have made of his dramatic talent. And yes, throughout the entire movie, we basically only see Joel's mental representation of Clementine, based on the memories they had together...but, even so, who's to say she's not real? Besides all the wonderfulness fore-mentioned, the plot deals with lots of intriguing questions, which are relevant to anyone who's ever been in any kind of relationship (hence my disbelief look when people tell me they didn't like it!). I think the main idea for the story (let me just take a moment to say how i find Charlie Kaufman a genius, and this partnership with Michel Gondry even more), has always been present in people's subconscious, the possibility to alter time and reality somehow, by erasing unpleasant memories, who wouldn't at least consider it? The great thing about the movie, what makes it so real and true, is that we learn that the sentence \"blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders\", can be questioned. This is what Joel finds out, but we can't shake off the feeling that it's something he (and all of us) knew all along.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman does it again working with Michel Gondry in this film. Starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who are both fantastic in their roles, the story of a man who vows to erase his significant other from his memory only to realize how much he loves her during the process is told sublimely from start to finish. This is honestly my favorite film of all time, and certain scenes never get old to me during re-watches.The concept of this film is probably one of the best and most original ones of all time. Having a man go through a relationship in reverse is honestly pretty freaking genius, and halfway through it when he realizes that he doesn't want to go through with the operation anymore perfectly sets up the second arc of the movie. Jim plays in surprisingly a very controlled and reserved manner, a character that is unlike those that he typically plays, and his subtlety helps to show what Joel Barish is feeling at any given time without having to overtly show the audience his thoughts. Whereas Kate is over the top in her performance; she overreacts, is loud and somewhat obnoxious, and yet times when she appears vulnerable makes you care deeply for the character and wonder what the result of the operation will be. Despite the differences in how the actors play their roles, the two complement each other perfectly, and there's real, playful, vibrant chemistry between the two leads.The imagery in the film is also really fantastic. Since the majority of the movie takes place in Joel's head, the memories that he relives during the operation relate to that of a dream; one scene may show them in a forest deep in the heart of fall, while the next scene can take them to a snowy beach without any questions arising about the sudden shift in the environment. The brilliant concept of having you see Joel and Clementine's relationship in reverse allows you to understand the sudden jumps from one event to another, and it's heartwarming to go from the struggles near the end of the romance to the happiest, joyous times when the two start to grow fond of one another.Some of my favorite scenes of all time are in this movie alone. And at first, I questioned the significance in Lacuna employees subplot since I was so, so invested in Joel and Clementine's story. After repeated watches I understand the relevance of showing those scenes; they reinforce the theme and allow the viewer to digest what's going on between the man whose losing his memory and the woman he's erasing. The events between Jim, Kate, and Kirsten Dunst's characters all show that basic human emotion can't be suppressed; no matter how hard one tries to forget a traumatic memory, if experienced again, anew, the human mind will have the same reaction to it over and over again. Mary falls in love with Howard (Tom Wilkinson) again, and Joel does whatever is in his power to hold on to his memory of Clementine. And in Joel's case, the lows of his relationship seem traumatic and horrible during the moment, but remembering the highs, laughs, and joy of what it once was is a euphoria that should be treasured deeply for years to come.The screenplay, acting, cinematography, costume design, production, everything I can think of in this film was absolutely top notch. The ending and other questions posed by the film are left ambiguous, and that itself is another part of the film that speaks volumes about its place in film history. In this collaboration between Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, a simple yet brilliant story is introduced. Yet, with the confidence of the screenplay and the assured, dedicated direction, both elevate the film to one that will be analyzed and loved for years to come.\n",

      "\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\" - Alexander PopeJoel and Clementine, once a happy couple, break-up. Joel can't take Clementine out of his head so he decides to patch up. He then learns an unbelievable truth that she had a clinic named Lacuna \"erase\" all of her memories related to Joel. Joel too out of anger decides to take on the procedure of erasing Clementine-memories from his head. Okay, I know what some may think. This is totally weird, right? But with Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, the screenwriters, weird stories always become entertaining that has undeniably smart elements. Eternal Sunshine remains their best work to date. It's an unforgettable psychological journey in a person's brain, his dreams, his desires captured with such contrast and vivid beauty that you will be left asking for more. At first, we feel quite envious of the technology that literally removes \"pain\" from our minds. The direction and screenplay capture this magnificently by taking us in Joel's head and actually showing us in their way how it happens. But soon this desire dies out with a deep emotion of dissatisfaction. Because Joel watches these memories fade away, he gets a second chance to relive them. He then understands that memories, however painful, are vital. I really wanted this erasing thing to exist in real life at first but then the film's extremely strong presentation made me change my mind. This impressive part makes the whole non-linear experience unexpected, thought-provoking and excites us to a higher level of curiosity. Once Eternal Sunshine grips us through it's smart allegory, it keeps getting better and better. What I loved most was the unexpected conclusion that forces us to wonder about the fate of the characters. What I loved more is that the film also never forgets the supporting cast, especially the \"erasers\" who work at Lacuna. During the erasing scene, which is the highlight of the entire film, the film kind of switches back and forth from Joel's memories to the real world. They show us the interaction of the Lacuna gang (Elijah Wood, Kirstin Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson). As we surge through Joel's emotions, theirs too is not overlooked. The screenplay smartly shows us how we human beings feel emotions, how we look at the person who's memory we are erasing and the person who's having it erased. In Short, Eternal Sunshine has a weird but differently smart screenplay that works which also won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2005. The Direction has a wonderful \"flow\" in it. The Cinematography has a beautiful colorful saturation and the score, wow, it just syncs with the flow. The film has impressive visual effects too that adds to the stunning imagery of Joel's memories.Now, the acting. First of all, I have never seen Jim Carrey act a serious character before. Joel is boring, dull, seeks solitude. I still wonder how he did that. This proves that Jim Carrey is more of a versatile actor rather than a comedian. Kate Winslet portrays the energetic, over-talkative Clementine, a complete opposite of Joel. She was nominated for the Oscar for this role and it's quite worth it. The most difficult part is bringing two completely opposites together to love each other which is pulled off perfectly by the two artists. Then comes the Lacuna gang. Wow, another surprise here. Their acting was realistic, if simply put. In conclusion, Eternal Sunshine is a spotless masterpiece. It's that piece of cinema that tries to approach film-making from a whole new perspective and the result is memorable. The film convinced me of the moral fact that even if you put someone out of your memory, you can't put them out of your heart.

      "Out of the thousands of movies I've seen, THIS is my favourite one.Why? Where shall I begin?All in all, because this movie touches me and give me emotions and moods I thought were never possible. I've never felt so melancholic, sentimental and almost nostalgic at the same time, but in an oddly good way. This is thanks to the strange and almost humorous effects used when Joel's memory erasing procedure is displayed. In addition, almost the entire movie is happening during winter months - a season which reinforces the down feeling, joined by the brilliant music of Jon Brion. Every time I see the start of the movie where Joel is awakening and the music plays, I can't get that song out of my head. If I whistle on it a day or two after, I feel a bit sentimental in some ways. That is how much power both the music and the film itself has on me.Jim Carrey can be proud of proving critics wrong with this performance. Every time I see the man, I can only think of hyperactive actions and quotes from Dumb & Dumber and Ace Ventura, every time EXCEPT in this movie. He has proved that you CAN take him seriously! Kate Winslet's performance is not going unnoticed either. The characters of shy, quiet and 'sissy' Joel and ballsy, 'speak my mind' Clementine makes it a good contrast which works very well.I also think this movie comment on two subjects in today's society and people - if memory erasing was as available as in this movie, you bet people would use it! With today's pressure on looks and everything, And second, it raises a question of ethics and morality, almost in the same way as plastic surgery or an even stronger example; abortion. How would people react to this availability of memory erasing?It seems that no matter how many times Clementine and Joel is going to erase each other from their memories, they will always SOMEHOW meet again (which is being hinted at the end of the movie where they repeat the same two second scene over and over), which raises question of the philosophical kind - does faith or an unknown power exist, that makes them meet no matter what?\n",

      "Director Michel Gondry, whose specialty in music videos was a seamless visual blending of reality and surreality, was the perfect filmmaker for this thoughtful, provoking drama which juggles past and present. Jim Carrey is excellent as a single man looking for love...and perhaps finding it with eccentric clerk Kate Winslet; unfortunately, a double-header secret from both their pasts may come back to haunt them. Gondry, who also worked on the original story with Pierre Bismuth and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, is masterful with a flashy scenario (both figuratively and literally), and he works surprisingly well with his eclectic group of actors. However, the characters in Kaufman's script aren't especially likable (particularly Winslet's argumentative love-interest) and the film is acutely chilly, with everybody bundled up and shivering. As the plot thickens, it also becomes convoluted (and, purposely one assumes, splintered); despite some missteps, Gondry works nimbly steering the viewer through the mechanisms of the narrative, and there several engaging or arresting sequences. Similar in tone and spirit to \"Being John Malkovich\", which Kaufman also wrote, and blazing with deft, daring originality. **1/2 from ****\n",

      "Going into this film, my friend said that this film was one of the greatest films he has seen. I still wonder where he was coming from when saying this.The premise of the film is pretty much your typical love story. Lonely dull man Joel (Jim Carrey) meets overly excited girl Clementine (Kate Winslet) and because the couple of the decade so to speak. Now, this film tries to be a bit too clever. We come to find out Clementine has erased her memory of Joel, and Joel wants to do the same. While in the procedure, he changes his mind and fights it, and the rest I won't spoil for you.While the acting wasn't terrible, the story and the point of the swerve was pointless and unremarkable. While it was a swerve, it was a swerve for the sake of a swerve. For a good chunk of the film, you're completely confused. Then, while everything gets explained, your only reaction would be, \"That's it?\" I don't care too much for the effects either, as well as I mentioned before the pay off. I feel there was no real message conveyed, and it was only a movie to get you to go, \"OOOOO\". Instead, I feel empty. I don't feel any kind of pay off was made, nor am I satisfied with wasting almost 80 minutes just for a swerve that has no basis other then just to be a swerve.I don't recommend this film for anyone seeing as it tries to be too clever with the clich√© love story, and completely fails.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman writes movies with uniquely bizarre premises and utterly human themes. In Being John Malkovich, he deals with identity, aspirations, and the hard reality of existence. Adaptation is about the creative struggle and the need to adapt and evolve with the circumstances. In Synecdoche, New York he presents us with a stylized look at our perception of life and other people. In Eternal Sunshine he searches through the meaning of love and memory. All of these descriptions are trite, insufficient, and probably inaccurate. They are, however, what I recall learning from and seeing in the films.I just re-viewed Eternal Sunshine. I think it is his best script, and one of the best scripts of the 00‚Ä≤s. In all his films, Kaufman is able to create a bizarre world filled with eccentric characters that are surprisingly like each of us. I have not had to deal with the rise and fall of a relationship like Joel and Clementine do in the movie. I have had to deal with the peaks and valleys of ones. I can most certainly understand the place memory holds in our value system.I recently saw a lecture on the meaning of happiness. The speaker noted that there are two main types of happiness: that which comes from experiencing and that which comes from remembering. This movie very effectively illustrates that there is a disconnect between the two. The lecturer noted that people who moved from Ohio to California would say that they are happier. They aren't. They remember the hard winters and are comparing their present experience to their memories. We tend to filter our memories to extremes, either very good or very bad. We tend to not place emphasis on the middle.One of the many problems with Joel and Clementine in the movie is that they place more emphasis on present experience rather than memory. In the end, Joel comes to realize the importance of memory, and its supremacy to the present. Even though he knows his relationship with Clementine will probably fail, he is will to move ahead, if only for the pleasant memories of pleasant times.The themes of this movie are similar to the themes of Dark City, another very good movie. The two might make an interesting double-feature, even though the forms of the movies are very different.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)Shifting Inner Realities and True LoveThe simple brilliance of the basic idea (erasing selective parts of the mind) and applying it in a way that feeds into pure romance (erasing only memories of a relationship with someone) makes for a movie that still could go all wrong. But it doesn't. Jim Carrey as Joel, the main thread we have through this misadventure, is at his best--comic without being plain old stupid, and feeding some mild angst. There are moments when you wonder, is this necessary, is this really that funny (like the dancing on the bed) and I think it depends on who you are. But most of the time you are waiting for the next improbable twist, which you swallow wholeheartedly because it's just so fun, and so enchanting. There is a confusing charm from start to finish, and you can't expect to get every detail or nuance, not the first time anyway. Some clues--watch the changing hair color of Joel's sometimes girlfriend Clementine (played with steady conviction by Kate Winslet), watch the weather. And be patient. Some bits get explained after the fact.The other engaging aspect to the movie is its visual trickery, tightly conceived so that when reality breaks down the movie doesn't just devolve into chaos, or into special effects. We feel as though we are shifting with the main characters from one reality to another. Brilliant, and beautiful, too.Seeing the movie a second time had a strange unpeeling effect that at first was welcome, because I understood it far better. In fact, I understood it, period, which I can't say about some other mind-shifting movies like Memento. And the problem grows that part of the movie's enjoyment is how it puzzles you. There are lots of movies that don't work as well on second viewing because they have lost their surprise, and this is a little like that, but it might take two looks to get to the saturation point. The happy ending lacks some sparkle now--it seems too packaged. A totally amazing twist, which should be doable these days, would be to make a movie that constructs itself from the DVD in slightly different ways every time you see it. Then your own reality would jostle around in spooky ways. As it is, it's still so weirdly curious and detached and romantic in steady spurts throughout, it's a special experience, one of those movies to talk about. In the end, pure Love beats it all.\n",

      "With his first two successful screenplays, Charlie Kaufman established himself as one of the most creative and idiosyncratic screenwriters in the business. But with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind he builds on this reputation further, showing a soft side that had previously been barely hidden behind his oft-charming middle-aged neurosis. It helps that this script is just as groundbreaking as that of Being John Malkovich or Adaptation.Kauffman's stand-in this time around is Joel Barish, a sweet loser played with his best sad puppy-dog face by Jim Carrey. It is difficult to tell you anything about Joel's romantic situation as it stands at the beginning of the movie, because doing so could partially reveal the truly ingenious plot structure. Suffice it to say that Barish is unlucky and unconfident with women and Kauffman beautifully plays with how we view Joel's situation.The basic premise is that Joel finds out that his longtime girlfriend, Clementine, played vibrantly by Kate Winslet, has had him erased from her memory using a new procedure developed by Dr. Howard Mierzcwak, with Tom Wilkinson playing the doctor to perfection. Joel, who is so grief-ridden by this turn of events, impulsively decides to have Clementine erased from his own mind. Mierczwak gets the treatment going immediately. The procedure consists of Joel being knocked out, strapped to his bed, and having a strange device attached to his head, while technicians delete the unpleasant memories overnight. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are the technicians, who along with Kirsten Dunst as Ruffalo's girlfriend raid Joel's liquor cabinet and start to have a good time. Ruffalo is a good-hearted loser, but Wood is up to something more deplorable, something that we begin to learn about gradually over the course of the erasing. Much of the movie takes place in Joel's own head, as he run through his distant memories of Clementine, who he gradually begins to realize he still loves. These scenes are executed with a perfect sense of surrealism by the talented music video director Michel Gondry, who establishes himself here as a true visionary. Unlike Spike Jonze he brings in mostly hand-held cameras which make the in-your-face surrealism of these scenes even more potent.But the movie's truest strength lies in the purity of the love story between Joel and Clementine. It is a realistic yet wholly uncynical portrait of a real couple. However quirky Clementine may be (and believe me, quirky she is), the couple has real problems, and their love is a viable force. To add to this, we get to see sides of Carrey and Winslet that have not yet been exposed until now. Carrey fully opens himself up emotionally. In every glance you see the self-doubt, the sadness, and the true love for Clementine, even when they first meet. Winslet feels more alive here than ever before, she has made what could have been a gimmick a person who feels intrinsically real, she inhabits the character entirely, making it her own and daring us not to like her despite her flaws.But it all comes back to Kauffman, who shows that he not only can blow your mind with his creativity, plot structure and surrealism, but he opens us up to his human side here and it is enough to break your heart and make you jump for joy.\n",

      "I had shown Eternal sunshine for 10 times. Now, I get a chance to make a review here. What I like the film most? the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Unbelievable, that Jim Carrey can act like that. Not stupid but boring man. Usually I seen Jim Carrey movie like comedy such as Ace Ventura, dumb and dumber. But he is kind of different he. He really merge to Joel Barish character. Boring man but make us pity and love him at once. Kate Winslet, did a good act too here. I love the way Kate Winslet express the Clementine character. She made Clementine lovable, cheer full but also insecure. very human. Michel Gondry did a good job here and also Charlie Kauffman (I also like Being John Malkovich, very original).. the point is, eternal sunshine is the most romantic film ever...Two thumbs up.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is, no doubt, a difficult film, unless one has read introduction or reviews before watching it, but it is absolutely a good one. The idea of erasing memory is not a fresh one actually, but the uniqueness of this film lies in the way it handles the process of erasing. Compared with other films, cartoons or books with this idea, which only take it as one part of the plot, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind does not only show us Joel's (Jim Carrey) memories about Clementine (Kate Winslet) in a reversed chronological order, but also makes a connection between his inner thoughts and the outer realistic ongoing. For example, when Joel hears Patrick (Elijah Wood) talking about how he steals his ideas, words and gifts to date and please Clementine during the erasing process, there is a reaction in his inner thoughts that he wants to tell Clementine that Patrick cheats. What is more, the pace of presenting memory is dealt with appropriately. Sometimes several pieces of memory are erased one after another in a compact way which causes you a kind of pain in heart that you can hardly tell, because the process is so fast that you do not even have time to resist Clementine's disappearance. Some other pieces of memory are dealt with in a relatively slow and peaceful pace, such as the seaside house episode and the one when Joel and Clementine meet each other for the first time. These pieces are so wonderful that you are unwilling to erase them and feel even more sorrowful when they are erased. The mixture of different paces to handle the erasing process has successfully avoided a monotonous slide show of memory.As for the cast, Jim Carrey has once again proved his talent. Different from his roles in the past, Joel is a quiet character with rich, complex inner world, which does not require much performance of exaggerated body language, and Jim Carrey has shown his ability in the subtle performance, such as the eye contact and the tone he speaks in, so as to fit in the role in the film. Elijah Wood is good, too, presenting a fairly realistic young man Patrick who courts girls with the advantages he takes of his work, and has erased all the traces of a Hobbit.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind just keeps us thinking about the way we treat our memory. Good memory is to be cherished, but what about the nightmares? Shall we just bury or erase them? Bad memory is painful for us, but doesn't it, together with the good part, make us whole people?\n",

      "I watched this film over two days ago, and have found it increasingly difficult to think of anything else since. An unassuming, honest, off-beat, film , 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is one of those movies that will grow on you and make you want to watch it time and time again, and is intelligent and thought-provoking enough to keep you captivated on repeated viewings.Boasting none of the usual Hollywood glitz, though the cast list is definitely something to show off about, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' follows the shy, quite and often seemingly 'boring' Joel Barish, who, after dating a girl called Clementine for several years visits her one day, only to discover she has no recollection of who he is and has in fact had him intentionally and entirely erased from her memory. Joel, distraught, hurt and confused, visits the place where Clementine had her memories of him erased and chooses to do the same to his memories of her. However, once made unconscious so the procedure could occur, he re-lives each of the memories as the team (Patrick, Frank, Stan and Mary) are trying to erase them, and suddenly decides that this may not really be what he wants. As the viewer we are given the chance to see Clem and Joel's relationship through these memories, how they met, the good times, the bad, why Clem finally decided she no longer wanted to have Joel as part of her life - or memory. And we also watch as Joel discovers that he doesn't, in fact, want to erase Clem from his life forever, and we sit at the edge of our seat willing Joel to find a way to keep his memories safe forever.I think 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a brilliant film, probably my second favourite film I have ever watched (the first being' A Beautiful Mind'). However, I do realise it's limitations too. It feels like a low budget movie (whether it is or not I do not know) despite boasting many Hollywood stars in the cast list. However, I feel that this definitely adds to the movie rather than takes away from it - it gives the film a sense of character, of individuality, as well as fitting the story well - for neither of the main characters live a glamorous life, so for the film to be filmed in that style would have been untrue to itself. Another limitation some may note would be the actual story - the idea of having a person fully erased from your memory is absurd, however, like certain other science-fictional stories I have seen or read (such as the novel, 'The Time Traveller's Wife') the absurdity of the idea comes second to the story, and the message of the story. The film is set in the real world, in our time, so it is easy to forget that memories cannot just simply be erased, and instead, as the viewer you pay attention to the story, and what the film is trying to ultimately say.The acting in this film is superb. Jim Carrey (who I have only ever seen in comedic roles previously) makes a breathtaking transformation into a serous role as Joel Barish, pulling off the character of a quite, shy loner with far more integrity and skill than I would have ever believed possible. Kate Winslet too made a startling change in my eyes from the only other role I'd seen her in (Rose in Titanic) to the gritty, fun-loving, unique, emotional, impulsive and incredibly chatty Clementine, who's ever-changing bright coloured hair makes the passage of time in the film slightly easier to follow. I think my favourite performance however was by Mark Ruffalo as Stan, and this is the second time Ruffalo has blown me away with a role and he will certainly be someone who I will keep my eye on in the future - he is an incredibly gifted actor.I don't want to say too much about this film as I don't want to give much away. I will say though that the final scenes were very emotionally powerful (which surprised me)and that, although the film is only about an hour and a half in length, the character development throughout makes it feel like you have known the main two characters, Joel and Clem, for many years, and you end up caring for them as you would for two good friends, wanting them both to be happy. The film worked enough to have me willing Joel to hide his memory's from the 'evil' eraser team, to remember Clem, and go back to her and make her remember him too, but whether that happens or not I will not say - you'll just have to watch and see. All I will say is that there are a few surprises that I defiantly was not expecting, that this film is not as predictable as you may expect, it being a love story and all.\n",

      "The greatest thing about this movie is that there are really weird science fiction kind of staff going on but the movie doesn't feel like a science fiction movie or even a weird movie , it all feels natural. Reason for this are : 1)Honesty : the actual love story is one of the most honest ones , it has its ups and downs like real life ,there are some serious things they don't like about each other , they will never live happily ever after , yet you feel like they might always love each other and its heart warming. 2)Acting :very natural , staying away from overacting , Jim Carrey actually surprised me , he should have an Oscar nomination but ironically you need to overact for that.3)Lightning and camera : i read that Michel Gondry didn't want to use any lightning at all but they used some in the end , the camera also reminds you that it's there , it's shaking a little , these even sometimes make you feel like you are watching a documentary. While they tried to market it as a romantic comedy , i think this is an anti-romantic comedy , a very sad and deep movie. with the things falling apart in most of the time in the movie i felt like my heart was falling apart. and with lines like ; \" Clementine: This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon. Joel: I know. Clementine: What do we do? Joel: Enjoy it. \" it connects everything to real life itself in an upsetting but enlightening way.\n",

      "As per usual, I knew nothing about this film before I watched it. I vaguely knew that it involved memory in some way, but that was the extent of my knowledge. Alas, the film began and I watched 108 minutes of the most disjointed cinema that I've ever see. I don't mean to imply that the film was bad, but I had such difficulty following it, that I couldn't enjoy it. I like to empathize with characters and the situations in which they find themselves and I couldn't do that. Every time (during the prolonged dream sequence) that Joel and Clementine were on screen, the shot would abruptly shift back to Joel's apartment where Patrick, Mary, or Stan was doing some random activity. This created a very surrealist feeling to the film. If you've seen \"Un Cien Andalou\" or another film from that era, you can understand what I'm trying to say. I'm not trying to be prude, but the experience of watching the film was so strange, that I could only think of that way to describe it.As I watched The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I couldn't help but wonder how mysterious Gondry's imagination must be. This film (other than a few obligatory pot and male bonding jokes) is entirely original. Nearly the entire film takes place in the dream world and the characters know it but how? Why was Clementine as desperate to keep her memory of Joel as he was of her? Were the opening sequence and the closing one different perspectives of the same sequence? These were the primary questions that I had as I watched. After I had finished watching, I think that Gondry wanted to develop a film about the importance of maintaining one's memory regardless of how painful it may be. I don't know though, can you read insight into this odd film? I doubt it, but at least I can pretend to be an English major.The film critics among the audience may enjoy the fast cuts and the numerous jump shots. All of them were necessary to add to the paranoia of the picture. During the dream sequence, there were several instances of low key lighting which were brilliant. They added to the \"hurried\" feeling. Also, when Carrey's character would recognize his memory failing, he would see the empty faces of various people (including himself). This probably took make-up artist Panchenko several hours for such short scenes. I was also pleased with how well match cuts were used to move Joel from memory to memory. As for acting, I've no complaints. Carrey, Winslet, and Cross did very good. Dunst, Wood, and Ruffalo didn't perform as well as I've seen them since their roles were mostly comedic. What surprises me most of all is how genuine Carrey acted Joel. Unlike other mostly-comedic actors, Carrey has significant talent and can perform outside of his preferred genre.I give this film a negative review you might say? Well no, I give this film a slightly positive review, but subtract many points because it's so very confusing. I've never felt a need for a hard copy of a script as badly as I did while watching this film. If you can handle the confusing set of events (which at times are a tad illogical), or if you're a philosopher, then you'll enjoy this film. Whatever message the film may have, I just don't get. I'm sure there is one, or it wouldn't be in the top 50 of the IMDb poll, so give it a go. Maybe after some more psychology classes (yea right) I'd understand it.\n",

      "I've just watched this film. It was going great until the credits appearance. The constant changes between past and present, in a confused and confusing way makes the viewer lost the focus.The linear time-line of a movie only can be altered with extreme care, because you may compromise the whole movie. You have to watch this movie more than once, no doubt about it.I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, but it's miles away from what people say about it. The concept was bad structured, the story doesn't evolve and there's little connection between Joel and Clementine, and I would dare to say that the movie is a bit pretentious too, with it's \"cult\" design and \"impressive\" images.You can't follow the time-line, the screenplay isn't strong enough to hold the attention to the picture. It won the Oscar, wow, such a big thing. The same academy that gave the Best Picture Award to the mediocre \"American Beauty\". Please Jim, try to team up with Frank Darabont again, he's a true genius!

      "Although packaged in fictional science and a pretzel logic plot, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is actually one of the deepest and most honest explorations of the risk, passion, irrationality and fragility of human relationships. Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are both mismatched and perfect for each other. We feel the true attraction of Joel and Clementine, while also seeing how they trip each other up. These contrary elements can be found in most real-world relationships, but are seldom portrayed with such truth and reality as in this movie. Usually in movies the tension between the attraction of partners and the flaws that repel them is treated as a stock motivation for the characters. In Eternal Sunshine, these features are deeply explored by the characters and revealed to us in ways that more conventional movies cannot approach.This raw truth in the movie is created in equal parts by the performances of Carrey and Winslet and by the unusual technological challenge to their relationship and the looping and reversing narrative that results. Every moment that Joel and Clementine are together the electricity flows between them--both positive and negative. This movie is a high water mark for screen chemistry between actors, and all of the chemistry fills in the full and passionate relationship of the characters. Forget about the twisting plot and the memory-erasing technology; the relationship, chemistry and performances of Carrey and Winslet alone would make this a great movie.Nevertheless, the fictional technology at the core of Eternal sunshine allowed Joel and Clementine to make choices that we in the real world cannot; and the consequences for Joel and Clementine only serve to intensify and deepen the revelation of their characters and relationship to themselves and to the movie audience. It is the kind of technology that could have been a gimmick or a distraction, but instead was used by Charlie Kaufman (screenplay) and Michael Gondry (director) to explore what makes a relationship tick. Yes, the world of this movie is completely strange and the narrative structure is fragmented and looping. But the relationship between Joel and Clementine always remains central and every odd situation and every twist back illuminates the characters. The \"trickiness\" of the screenplay is never used just to be clever or throw the audience off.The strange and fictional science of Eternal Sunshine takes Joel, Clementine and us to places we have never gone in movies or in real life, but every aspect of Joel and Clementine as persons in a relationship are completely real and fully realized. One of the greatest relationship movies ever.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine\" is one of the rare films that actually overcomes its flaws completely and makes itself into a great film without dishing everything out to the audience. There's no real format to the film. It jumps from place to place, often confusing the viewer for a moment, but creating a unique and rewarding experience.The acting in the film is great across the board. Jim Carrey gives a very good, but not quite Oscar-caliber turn as Joel, a quiet writer whose dull nature destroys any true fun in his relationships. Kate Winslet plays Clementine, an impulsive and energetic woman whose hair color is constantly changing as her relationship with Joel does. Winslet is really the shining star in the film. She is beautiful, vibrant, and full of life, bringing an edge to the film. It's truly a shame she wasn't put in the Supporting Actress section of the Oscars, where she could have had a win. Elijah Wood is annoying as usual, but he's playing an annoying character so it's passable. Tom Wilkinson is very good as the doctor behind the whole experiment that is the basis of the film, and Kirsten Dunst is surprisingly fantastic in a small role as the doctor's secretary. The plot itself is fantastic, truly delving into the mind and memories of Joel. Carrey is a little over the top at times, but he still moves through the film well with help from the leading lady. This is an extraordinary, Oscar-nomination worthy film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart film that is also funny and dramatic at times.\n",

      "Amazing film that has changed and shaped my life. Highly recommended. The impact of Winslet and Carry's performances is completely unforgettable. If people have been through any sort of rift in a relationship they will completely understand the film. Though I am sure there are people who don't and with that in mind cannot fully comprehend the movie. Kaufman is brilliant. The scenes shot in New York (especially Grand Central) are amazing, and accurate. Montauk in the winter is completely isolated. Everything was done correctly in this film which is a relief. As well the film has a great soundtrack with very diverse music. I love this film.\n",

      "This film is completely uninspired and is at best one-dimensional. It seems to be a mixture between Total Recall and Sleepless in Seattle, only even more boring than the latter. As a love movie it is quite disturbing. As science fiction, the material is not new and the concept is littered with continuity errors and such false, unrealistic concepts that the movie fails to serve even a surface deep analysis.The acting in the film is nevertheless realistic (though based on poor material), and Jim Carey shows some actual acting ability (rather than a new stupid facial expression that is the motif of his other successful works). Other than the acting, the only redeeming features of this film are the appearances of Kirsten Dunst, amazing camera-work and an inspired soundtrack. A pity that the concept and script were awful.I recommend only watching this movie if you are interested in meaningless American value mind-garbage with no stimulus at all.\n",

      "This review contains spoilers.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a 2004 science-fiction romantic drama movie that is directed by Michel Gondry. The movie is written by Charlie Kaufman, Michel Gondry, and Pierre Bismuth. The movie stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. A couple meet at the cold beach of Montauk and begin a romantic encounter. They discover that they may have had a pre-existing history with one another.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a fantastic movie that explores many different themes. The movie explores romance, ups-and-downs, and memory. These themes are interwoven in the narrative and characters masterfully. The charms of both of the leads in Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet shine through in the movie. The movie mainly explores Joel as he undergoes a memory wiping procedure. Joel's memories begin being removed and he sees his memories with Clementine one last time. As this occurs, Joel thinks back on his memories.Eternal Sunshine uses a non-linear narrative to tell its story. This is helped by the fact that Joel's memories are being wiped. This non-linear narrative is used to great effect as it explains many parts of Joel's fond memories with Clementine. It also shows Joel's unpleasant memories of Clementine. Both of these moments are displayed to great effect by the movie and I felt myself enjoying these scenes. The scenes in this movie are incredibly authentic.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both do an excellent job in their roles. The story with these two is engrossing to watch and it makes for captivating cinema with adequate direction. The scenes with the two are handled with great care.There is a subplot in this movie with Kirsten Dunst's character Mary Svevo. The subplot does explain how later the two characters recognize the memory wiping procedure. However, the subplot does focus on the negative aspect of memory erasure. For Mary, she had unrequited feelings for her superior. This felt unrealistic as given what happens in the movie, the doctor should have removed Mary from the position. This was also not a secret as the doctor's wife was also involved. I felt that this part could have been handled better.I would recommend 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.Grade: A\n",

      "Not my style of Romantic movie. I like the cheesy, fun and easy going romance movies. This movie is pretty slow and boring. Even then, I could never get attached to the main characters. They are both weird and never really showed that true \"I'll do anything for you\" love. I also don't think it did a good job of the whole \"they are so in love that they always fall for each other, even after their memories are gone\". Apparently I'm in the minority here but it just wasn't my style.\n",

      "Jim Carrey and an 8.3/10 IMDb rating are enough to watch a movie, plus the plot sounded intriguing.A guy goes to a company to have the memories of his ex-girlfriend erased. I can get behind that. The bulk of the movie is a mind's eye view of the erasing process as well as the regret over some of the memories being wiped away. The key is that ALL memories of that significant other are erased.I thought the movie was \"nice.\" It wasn't anything I'd go gaga over or repeatedly watch. There was some romance, or what was considered romance for a gregarious, spontaneous girl (Kate Winslett) and a subdued almost mopey guy (Jim Carrey). There was plenty of relationship drama and a splash of sci-fi. It was decent entertainment\n",

It was unfortunate we were making out during most of the movie and never got to finish watching it. She forewarned me it's confusing so I don't recommend making out during this movie. Oddly, I don't remember the girl's name but I did remember tid-bits of the movie which encouraged me to watch it again,and again and again, after 20 times. The one word I would describe it best is \"original.\" There is simply nothing like this movie and its amazing soundtrack only adds to its allure. It is a time-warp type of movie so the easiest way to follow it is when Clementine's hair is blue which shows the present. Any other hair color is the past or a dream. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n",

      "I suppose the 2000s was the decade of polarizing movies. I never knew anyone who either loved or hated movies like The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, About Schmidt, Requiem for a Dream and this movie. The spectrum is that extreme with very few in between calling something \"ok\" or \"good, not great\". I was one that loved this because it was a uniquely different romantic comedy. A genre I do not enjoy. I was also not a fan of Charlie Kaufman's earlier story, Being John Malkovic. That failed for me in alot of major ways compared to this movie though it takes the same different approach. Felt the ending was flat in that.This is basically a romantic comedy with splashes of drama and sci fi thrown into the mix. Not too much of those elements get mixed in to change it from what it is. I suppose people have to relate to the characters desires early on to understand the plot enough in order to enjoy the movie. Ive known people who are perfectly happy trying to drag a friendship out of doomed relationship even if what they drag out is something like those creatures in Cronenberg's The Brood. I prefer to break clean and permanently and prefer to date someone who relates to that. Its less complicated to move on.Story does get a little corny at times and perhaps thats where my dislike for romantic comedies kicks in. As I said, not my cup of tea but this is unique enough to be entertaining despite that.\n",

      "A summary of toxic relationship between Joel and Clementine told in a non-linear storytelling who is trying to erase each other's memories, literally.It proves Charlie Kaufman as a great writer, especially for me after witnessing I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020). The genre is drama, Sci-Fi and the plot goes non-linear with unexpected things coming and unknown timeline, but viewers are helped by the movie details on dialogues, characters, stuff and any related stuff to make it clear what's going on.It's weird to see Jim Carrey's role as an introverted person named Joel but his role develops as the appearance of Clementine (Kate Winslet) as his lover.\n",
      "Kate Winslet's portrayal is also well-acted and decent since she is undoubtedly talented, she plays an eccentric and impulsive girl.This movie is pretty mindbending yet the love story is solid and it is taken in both consciousness and unconsciousness of the leading character.\n",

You know the relationship is doomed but you can't help but still love them. I feel that if forgetting really existed we both would have had the exact same experiences that was in the movie. It's exactly if we forget history we are doomed to repeat it. This is a movie you finish watching than you have to go back and watch it with everything you learned. That's what I think a 10/10 movie does is make you rematch it to find the little things that you know you missed.Edit: The movie shows that it doesn't matter what memories we erase we will always go back. They can't learn or grow from the experiences they shared if they keep erasing it.\n",

He goes deeper and deeper as he clears his memory, not just to hide her, but to share for the sake of intimacy.The two protagonists share many of the same characteristics, a warm and carefree but insecure, a cautious and suspicious but arrogant and sentimental. How do we fill our gaps and at the same time give love. The emotional center of gravity in a relationship determines the composition of memories, so it's important to consider all emotions before drawing conclusions about a relationship. It may diminish feelings, but not memories; It may diminish memories, but not emotions.The real meaning of final farewell is not to forget the experience, but to say goodbye. In the end, the true meaning of love is, throughout the experience, or choose you.\"Every memory has an emotional core, and when the core diminishes, the memory diminishes.\"\"Used to be, not anymore.\"\"People have to learn to share. That's what intimacy is all about.\"\"Forget the world, and be forgotten by the world.\"\"At least come back and say goodbye.\"\"She...

      "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is a movie that really surprised me in many things, the story / the acting / the custom design, and just everything.In my opinion, this is Jim Carrey's best performance ever, really loved his acting and it was just so deep, he played that character so very well. Now for Kate Winslet, all I'm going to say is just WOW, an amazing and incredible performance that I will never forget, her attitude and the way she represented that character \"Clementine\" was so accurate and exactly how it should be, a great choice and so happy that she got nominated for an Oscar.The custom designs were so incredible, especially Clementine's (played by Kate Winslet), it did match with her hair and with Clementine's character. The many different hair colors of Clementine Kruczynski was so amazing and loved how it helps the viewer keep track of where her relationship with Joel (Played by Jim Carrey) corresponds to the plot.The script was so very well written and really deserved an Oscar win, loved how the movie makes you think that this thing happens first but in the end, you see that it was the other way around and for those who saw the movie will get what I mean, really wish if I can talk more about that part but I can't or I'll spoil many things.The movie has many scenes that are ''classic'' and will just be stuck in your head like the one when Clementine and Joel were laying on the ice and watching the stars, or the scene where Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) are dancing in their underwear over an unconscious Joel.Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is a deep movie that shows you that if a person gets attached to someone else, they will never forget them even if they do the impossible. A great movie and one of my all-time favorites.My rating is: 9/10** DO NOT READ THIS PART IF U HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE **\n",
      "I have read once that one version of the script of the movie ends with Clementine and Joel in an endless cycle of erasures and getting back together. In the last scene, an elderly Clementine visits Dr. Mierzwiak, and the screenplay calls for the audience to see a computer screen showing 15 dates of previous erasures stretching back 50 years, all of them involving Joel Barish. I would really love to see that version, especially that ending, it sounds interesting and its a great ending, not saying that the ''actual ending'' sucks but I think that other version would've been way better.\n",

The film features two incredible lead performances from Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey and it is arguably the highlight of Carrey's career. I can certainly understand why this would be met with mixed responses but, whether it resonates with you or not, it has to be lauded as an incredibly creative piece of writing.\n",

      "361\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, while not the first to do so, helps to prove many important things about great films. It shows that one need not have an extremely high budget and production value to make an amazing film, and phenomenal acting and a solid, interesting story are sufficient. It is proof that the background can be as important as the things that are happening overtly in the foreground. And it is further evidence that a typically type-casted actor can give you phenomenal results when given room to move and explore their acting range. It does all this while at the same time leaving you awe struck by the beautiful imagery, emotional wrenching dialogue and a story which both touches us deeply and gives us something totally unique.Let us begin with the star of the film, both on the call sheet and in tangible gravity, Jim Carrey. By the time this film had come out, we already knew that Jim Carrey had the acting chops far beyond his zany characters in Ace Venture (1994) and Dumb and Dumber (1994). We saw his range in Man on the Moon (1999) and The Truman Show (1998), the former of which still allowed him to delve into the whacky. These were followed up by more comedy in the forms of The Grinch (2000) and Bruce Almighty (2003). As if to remind us that he is a phenomenal actor, this movie came out at the perfect time to give us a buffer between these silly, though admittedly great, films.Jim Carrey's character, Joel Barish, is a hopeless introvert wracked by social anxiety and stuck in the monotonous capitalist machine. His portrayal of this is so palpable that it resonates through the screen and makes you writhe in your seat wishing you could reach out and give him a reassuring pat on the shoulder. It is so complete. His speech patterns, volume and vocal stutters. His eye and head movements. And most importantly, his body language. Throughout the beginning of the film, he wrings his fingers, avoids eye contact and sabotages himself at inconvenient moments. He lives and breathes the character in every way. Having suffered in his real life from mental disorders, it's likely he drew on this experience for the film, but nevertheless he needs to be highly praised for his portrayal of it on screen.At first glance, the beauty of the film is almost lost, due to the rather bleak visuals of the New York scenery in winter and the dull greys and dark shadows present throughout the film. This somber atmosphere parallels the rather bleak reality of both the main characters' lives. What is beautiful here is not so much the landscapes or grand scenery, but the amazing camera work, practical visual effects and the juxtaposition of striking colors against dull backgrounds. You never know exactly what is going to happen when the camera flips around, and the mixing of elements from different parts of the film when Joel is in his mind creates a wonderful contrast.Another masterful technique of this film is it's ability to make the audience aware of subtlety. Usually, we are focused on the overt elements of a film, for good reasons. The large action sequences, the wide arcing shots of cities, the prominent face of a character during a monologue. Eternal Sunshine wastes no space on the screen. Every square centimeter is used to its full potential by packing in hidden foreshadowing, visual gags and Easter eggs. This is a film with infinite rewatchability because there is no way to see all of the things happening in the background in one viewing. The signs on shops, the books in a bookstore, the TV in the room, they all in some way flow with the events of the story or mimic a character's emotions. It is one of those films which rewards the audience and makes them feel they've earned something by noticing the subtle details that the director worked so meticulously on.Eternal Sunshine is a romance without unnecessary cheesiness, it is science fiction without overreaching suspension of disbelief, it is drama with the lightness to let you breathe. It has the ability to make you really feel a part of the story and want to reach through the screen and lend a helping hand to the characters. This film got an unfortunate run at the box office, but the cult following and long lasting cultural legacy it has developed is a testament to amazing film-making and thoughtful script-writing. It has the makings of a film which will survive becoming dated or fall into obscurity. I can only hope that is the case so that more people get to experience the wonder of this incredible film.\n",

      "I have read a lot of comments and reviews from this movie that give only 1 star. Actually, I also agree that this movie has very unsatisfied plot. It felt like, everything the actors did in the movie just ran for 1 day. Next, people really hate the ending. Due to the fact that they wanna continue their relationship after they heard their own recording. It seemed like the movie doesn't not give the message that people wanted. They will just end up like the previous one. Fighing again.In the other hand, I believed you gonna agree with me that this movie has a very good idea. I cannot imagine this movie will give you a new taste of romance movie. Next, I like everything that is managed in the every scenes. The lighting that was chasing the couple was amazing for me. When some memories wanted to be removed, they were gone suddenly after the couple tried to run away from it. For the ending, I know many people hated it, because they would ruin their chance again. I just want to remind you that this is why a chance comes to a couple. Trying to know each weakness is important to build our relationship.\n",

      "Rating: 9I never gave this movie a try as I am not a fan of romantic genre but this is a beautiful movie. The beginning seems to be a bit slow as the credits roll after 18 mins in the film. This marks a top spot in my list of movies now. If you have ever been in a relationship you can obviously jot the ups and downs you've gone through and this is what this movie is. It just brings in the Sci-Fi factor of getting your mind erased which can sway either side being good or bad.The Good - I loved the cast, the concept, the acting and cinematography of this movie. It just left me with feels and I had a trip down the memory lane. Also at some point I wondered whether this procedure exists in real world or is it just fantasy. If a movie can make you think and put you in an existential crisis, it obviously deserves respect.The Bad - I guess the movie might have a targeted audience. If you have ever been in love and had a rough patch, well watch this movie and get a hold of your life. The beauty of movies is that there is no single way to interpret the theme, you can just relate it to your individual experience.A must watch film with superb performances put up by the cast. Go ahead and watch, it will be worth your time.\n",

      "I think this is a rare movie. There are in-depth performances on such subtle and difficult-to-describe topics as consciousness and subconsciousness, but they are not fragmented and unknown. With the help of memory and sober consciousness, explore the boundaries of consciousness and subconsciousness. Even though I have fallen asleep and intend to accept the memory cleared myself, consciousness seems to be somewhat subjectively active. Clearing the memory of \"antagonism\" in the subconscious, it is also in the battle between the different desires of the conscious and subconscious, it seems to slowly understand what they really want to do.The feelings that will happen and that will happen, even if the memory is cleared, because people have not changed, maybe it is destined to happen, so the feelings that will happen are also a fate. If you want to get rid of a relationship, you really need to change, maybe it is the various tendencies and habits of this \"me\", otherwise when you choose, if you feel mixed with habits, you will still follow the same path. This may be why even The memory is cleared, but the characters in the film repeatedly like the same person. But the running-in of these relationships has always had such difficulties.To keep Clementin's memory deeper and deeper into her consciousness is an interesting plot setting. This process made Joel and Cle go to his childhood and consciousness about shame, and also learned his deepest secrets together. Here, because I want to forget, but find that I actually don't want to forget, I move towards true intimacy. My imaginary love should have nothing to hide from the other party, even because of this relationship, go to the corner of myself and the other party has never been inside.After watching this video, I shared some thoughts with my roommate s, and shared some clips of my relationship with him that I felt shame again. Some feelings that I didn't even realize were reappearing. Maybe I have been longing for intimacy from a certain angle in my heart, but in reality the relationship with all kinds of people encountered is the same as Joel and Cle. There are vibrant parts, but there are also difficult to reconcile. Is it willing to take the next \"cooking\" as the answer to finding love, may be an open proposition, if you choose \"yes\", you must accept the wonderful and coexisting compromises day after day. If it is \"no\", there is no need to clear the memory.\n",

If you are a real freak or geek, you really going to watch it again and again to understand the underlying concept.Story, although is mind bending, but you will enjoy and especially when it is played by Jim Carrey.One thing, I feel was not justified.

I don't think there's a single complaint here. The all star cast is wonderful, the dream-like visuals are indeed fondly remembered like a dream and feel like a pleasant one in the moment, it clashes all these genres together to make you feel the whole range of human emotion one by one as it's taken away from the protagonist, it's sharply written, a visual spectacle, full of shocking twists, it really does have everything: it's funny, sad, romantic, tragic, mournful, disturbing, surprising, and awe-inspiring.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" released in 2004 is directed by Michel Gondry and written by Charlie Kaufman. The main characters of the movie are \"Clementine\" and \"Joel\" played by Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey. They are helped out by a marvellous supporting cast led by Tom Wilkinson also including David Cross, Jane Adams, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood.Most movies reduce love to a greeting card sentiment. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" on the other hand treats it as a subject for extended philosophical inquiry. The film is cerebral formally and conceptually complicated, dense with literary allusions and as unabashedly romantic as any movie you'll ever see. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a breakup drama, a romantic comedy but with one crucial element plucked from the universe of science fiction.The movie opens, and we see a meet-cute between Clementine and Joel. \"Kate Winslet\" as Clementine is unforgettably charming and obnoxious and \"Jim Carrey\" as Joel is shy, sweet, anxious and sincere but after the meet-cute, the film skips into the future, and we see that Joel and Clementine have broken up. Joel Doesn't want to remember the terrible pain of breaking up, so he goes to a doctor played by \"Tom Wilkinson\" to erase Clementine from his memory.As human we go through many tragedies in a lifetime, be it a breakup or death of a loved one. These tragedies or pain that we go through is part of human nature and the movie revolves around this very concept gracefully. This film presents the idea of a breakup in a hauntingly beautiful way. The movie reflects on the concept of loss and pain. \"Joel\" is a shy, timid person. He doesn't like taking risks; he doesn't like being spontaneous as opposed to \"Clementine\" being spontaneous and wild, so the idea of these two opposing personalities getting attracted to each other makes the movie so fascinating. The movie is captivating, universal, and most importantly, the characters in the film are so real. This movie will make one instantly connect with the characters and especially with Joel and Clementine with their situation.Gondry and Kaufman have created a fantasy world and populated it with real people. Michel Gondry is amazingly resourceful and visually creative, seamlessly moving from reality into dreams and back again. Kaufman's script is fantastic, and on so many levels, the dialogue is witty and psychologically acute. The structure is wildly inventive and complex, and yet everything is held together by its coherent internal logic. Charlie Kaufman has an enormous brain, and this movie is bristling with ideas about time, desire, memory and the structure of human consciousness. The real achievement of this film is the way that it connects all the speculations to real, recognizable human emotions it suggests that the reason we think so much is that we feel so profoundly.\n",

      "At first I thought I was going to see something familiar to \"Lost In Translation\". but that thought immediately changed. the story's plot is very confusing and explaining it would just ruin a bit of it's uniqueness. so I want to focus on the characters. both of Jim Carry and Kate Winslet\"s characters are unique and lonely. my first impression on these characters are how familiar they are to the ones in \"lost in translation\". they both need their own space and they act really differently than other people, that's what I find so great in them. Jim Carry is just amazing in this role, I never really got attached to his roles in comedy movies but to see him in this film was a big change.\n",

This movie may seem a little strange because of its unconventional storytelling style but the more you get involved in it, the more you begin to like it.

Clementine with her impulsiveness erases Joel completely.Knowing this how will a ego of betrayed lover calm down.Well here it came down by erasing his too. The movie really begins here with their moment's of love,sorrow, fights being run and erased one by one from Joel's memory at one point he realises that it's not the right way and he truly loved her and tries to spot it.But not everything will help you to hooked to your loved one's.The very ending of the movie is the new beginning.Even from erasing each other out of their memory they come back as some people are destined to be together but this time they know their mistakes.

      "Watching this movie again now, I no longer agree with the love point in it. Even if two people have more and more sweet memories together, they cannot withstand the irreconcilable contradictions found when reason separates. Maybe you will fall in love with this person again, but this person is still the wrong person. Even lying down to watch the stars is just a meaningless repetition.\n",

      "A unpredictable screenplay, Strong acting of both stars, with great location made it good so far.Scientifically view, i think they could do much better with memory technology, maybe lack of effort i Don't know. Beside that it's a perfect movie to watch in your boredom\n",

      "It seems like a okay but not okay, this movie is filled with pack of human drama. After watching this movie I can't be normal and some emotions have been haunting me...\n",
      "Cult classic\n",
      "395\n",
      "After rewatching this movie I can definitely now say that it is my all-time favourite film.\n",
      "Everything is just so perfect in this film. The performances, the dialogue, the music, the cinematography.\n",
      "Charlie Kaufman is just such a fantastic writer, he moves away from many clich√©s associated with romance films and instead decides to delve into the complexity of the human mind, creating real characters and real emotions. The writing is just so perfect that it never feels stale and there is not one boring moment in the film, and I'm sure I will be visiting it time and time again.\n",
      "It manages to maintain a certain level of realism while it deals with the absurdity of the actual concept of the film, which is why it is no surprise that it won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n",
      "In addition, the music in this film is just great and the numerous piano scores really help to add to the already emotional scenes.\n",
      "Jim Carrey really gives off an impressive performance, straying away from his more commonly-associated comedic roles. He really adds depth to the character of Joel and truly gives you the impression that you are witnessing events happening to a real man. He puts in an Oscar-worthy performance in my opinion. Credit should not be taken away from Kate Winslet's performance either, as she is equally amazing and together they help explore all the complexities that are hidden beneath relationships.\n",
      "Furthermore, the cinematography is incredible and the director Michel Gondry puts in a lot of effort to make you feel like you are experiencing the intimacy of the relationship between Joel and Clementine, by the use of many wonderful close-up shots. He also leans more towards using practical effects rather than special effects which actually does give off the impression of experiencing a more realistic story.\n",
      "Overall, this film is an experience that everybody should go through and in my eyes it has become timeless and will forever be one of the greatest films ever made.\n",
      "396\n",
      "I very much liked this film which I saw years ago. It was whimsical and beautiful in the way it unfolded on screen. Charlie Kaufman's screenplay and Michel Gondry's direction made for a highly entertaining film where the word \"charming\" comes to mind. Sometimes the special effects were a bit too self-aware, but then again that helped make it an original vision. I would love to see another collaboration between these artists.\n",
      "397\n",
      "This movie is yet another prove that Charlie Kaufman is a genius.This movie is, paradoxically, extremely bizarre and bluntly honest. We share the same inner struggles as the characters and the way it explores our relationships is so... real, with all our faults and contradictions.Thanks Charlie Kaufman for this brilliant movie! 10/10\n",
      "398\n",
      "Love is well illustrated in this movie. Love is accidental collision in the river of time. Life is like a long stream of daily necessities. We search for love in the crowd, attracted by the commonality of our lovers. But the ending is always unsatisfactory. So we have the pain of lovelorn, for the trouble of pursuing but not getting. Life is only a pause in time, all meaning in the moment it happens. No matter how many times you repeat, when you meet love again, you will still feel that the world is beautiful.\n",

I believe everyone in our lives exists for a reason even if they left they leave another person with updated behaviour and experience. So no and that's what we realise I didn't think that they meant for each other so they got together again but just a whole experience with its good and its bad has been erased and you gonna experience it again it's just have to be.\n",

I liked how the beginning of the movie was actually the end and how you didn't realise that till the end and just thought it it was the beginning of their relationship. I don't have to talk about the acting because simply everyone fit the role first non comedian movie to watch for Jim Carrey and totally nailed it. I don't if somebody felt this while watching it or just me but I felt loneliness as memories was being erased anyways I liked it.\n",

      "Kate Winslet brings the character of Clementine to life and as she does for her lover Joel (Jim Carrey) she leads the viewer on a journey of choosing, losing and rediscovering a deep and complicated love, one that's fascinating and thought-provoking. The film caused me to question the association between pain and memory, and the basic humanness of this experience. It was a good reminder to do what I can to create good memories for myself and others in this short life and to be fu3lly present in these.\n",
      "410\n",
      "Wow, this is a great movie. I avoided it for the longest time because I just didn't feel in the mood of watching Jim Carrey in a non-comedic goal, but man, he is great in this movie. As a matter of fact all of the actors are amazing in here, especially Carrey and Winslet, but everyone else is really good, too.I think where this movie stands out really is in the amazing original script by Charlie Kaufman. This is a very original, different movie not just about relationships and break-ups, but also a film with a deeper movie about human psychology and how the good memories will always outweigh the negative ones. And where was once love, one can never go back, as it will always come back in one way or another. A great movie.\n",

      "415\n",
      "An incredible film. Easy to relate to and makes the viewer think deeply about their own experiences and relationships. It is a film that moved me. The excellent cinematography mixed with the quick camera movements really make you feel wrapped up in the action of the film.An incredible thought-piece, and a deeply emotional story. Jim Carrey shines in a different type of role he is accustomed to.\n",
      "416\n",
      "Starts off fairly normal, gets weird and surreal in the middle, and then somehow manages to resolve in a surprisingly straightforward ending. Great script.\n",
      "417\n",
      "I had this movie in my to view list for a while and I decided to watch it today. I was impressed with how sensible the movie is and how current it is still. Nowadays people tend to move away from relationships at the first challenge even though that relationship may worth an extra try, a little bit of effort and communication.\n",
      "I just loved the way the director decided to tell the story by starting with the day Joel woke up after the procedure. It made so much sense in the end to understand his urge to drop everything and just go to that beach. It is impossible to not reflect about all the challenges in all relationship and how important it is to stick with the things that made that relationship work at the first place. I just loved this movie.\n",
      "418\n",
      "So in the beginning, I thought this is ridiculous mainly Kate Winslet because her acting was a bit unusual or overreacted. but wait for it, it got interesting after the break up when Joel wants to forget Clementine, but in the prosses of erasing her from his brain Joel change his decision and tried to stop the prosses which he could not while half unconscious.I believe, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is about the power of love and how much difficult is it to forget our beloved one, even if want to forget the power of love and attraction will continuously find and compel us to bend the knee to the almighty love.In my opinion, the movie is excellent, especially Jim Carrey's acting, the script, and the way it is manifested through the power of abstract.\n",
      "419\n",
      "Great performances by Jim and kate. The movie explores different stages of relationship between Joel and Clementine and is very beautifully depicted through Joel's reaction to save or lose that memory. Kate as beautiful as ever nails her role as Clementine and her hair is symbolically coloured through each stage of their relationship. The ending is as perfect as it can get, both Joel and Clementine accept the fact that they are not perfect and its okay if things gets complicated again.\n",
      "420\n",
      "I first saw this film over 10 years ago, but I recently rewatched it. It was weird, like I remember, but it really makes you think about relationships especially if it's better to have loved or lost or never to have loved before.\n",
      "421\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind is one of the most beautiful and sad love stories of all time. The characters are relatable, the situation is realistic, and most of all the relationships feels real. Every single line in this film is realistic, logical, and oftentimes beautifully truthful. You can tell Kaufman takes inspiration from his own life through the honesty of each characters insecurity, memories and moments that they observe, which is inspiring as an artist, and even more as a writer.The story is interesting and gripping, while still being honest and slow, while it offers interesting set design, cinematography and other directorial expressionism that is unique and technically interesting with its effects.I think Joel and Clementine will stay together, and finally accept that they need to be together because of how colossal this event is. If Joel didn't care and really don't want to be with her, he would have listened to the tape and moved on, but he clearly did, because he came back.I think it is moral to release the tapes because the patients should know. Everyone has a right to know what or who was in their lives, and I think that's the whole point of the film, that you learn from those memories and experiences.\n",

      "Both of them ended up devastated after their relationship and try to erase their memories in order to continue with their lifes.With this premise in mind,Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind exhibithey will stay ts a really good cinematography,with really good moments in which you don't really where you are and you can experience the same confussion and anxiety as Joel.The films also at the same shows at times certain bits of the past of their protagonists,as well as another parallel arc that is related to the main story.\n",
      "The main story has a really significant meant and the director trust in us to find out what the film is trying to told us relying on his spectators at all times\n",
      "At the end of the film,Joel and Clementine start again with their relationship,so in my opinion i think they will because even if they know that will struggle along their relationship both of them don't want to turn to those problems their back and erase their memories again.They will try to solve those problems with their experience and learn from their own experiences in order to be better persons on their lifes.\n",
      "One of the characters decides to tell to Joel and Clementine what they did in order to erase themselves from their memories.This choice is very ethical I think because it shows that after been through the same experience as Joel and Clementine,Mary decided that her clients must know what are they doing by erasing their memories and the consequences that that decission has into their own lifes.To resume,I think is a good film as an entertaiment and at a phylosophical level,because it makes you think about how each and every one of us should face their own life,without considering anything that other people might say or think about us.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a 2004 sci fi film featuring an all star cast ranging from Jim Carrey to Mark Ruffalo to even Kirsten Dunst and Kate Winslet. Movie tells the story of a timid man named Joel(Carrey) who meets a quirky woman on a train named Clematine(Kate Winslet sporting coloured hair)and they start a relationship,but when Clematine goes through a procedure where she erases Joel from her mind,Joel does the exact same thing.\n",
      "Seeing Jim Carrey in a film where he plays a normal shy bloke not doing silly faces was interesting. I guess Jim wanted to be in a film where it isn't a comedy and wanted to prove to Hollywood that he isn't a typecast actor.Kate Winslet was quite quirky in this film and it was funny seeing Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst in cameo roles as doctors who work at the clinic where Clemaintine got rid of her memories of Joel.If you are a fan of Carrey and you want to see that his not some zany person then its definitely worth a watch.\n",
      "424\n",
      "This film is really interesting to watch. It makes the viewer consider parts of the human psyche and ask themselves a question- if you had the chance to forget a bad memory, would you take it?Throughout the movie, Joel is having the memory-erasing procedure done after his ex-girlfriend, Clementine, erased him from her memory. He begins to realize that he doesn't want to lose his memories of Clementine; it's worth it to remember the pain, because the good times still happened. Throughout the second act of the film, Joel and the Clementine from his memories are trying to hide from the procedure. Unfortunately, they are unable to. His memories of her are erased.In the last half hour of the film, two very important things happen. First, Joel and Clementine meet again, revealing that the scene from the start of the film is actually the day after their memories are erased. They are quickly heading down the same route as before when the second important thing happens; Mary, the assistant at Lacuna, (the memory-erasing business), sends every recipient of the memory-erasing procedure the tape of their first visit. These tapes recorded all of the things that those people wanted to erase from their memories. This throws a wrench into Clementine and Joel's relationship, but they overcome it and decide to stay together.There are a few questions that arise from these plot points; what's going to happen with Clementine and Joel's relationship? And did Mary do the right thing?Well, first of all, I believe that Clementine and Joel would stay together, but not for very long. They'd have a tumultuous relationship, which would last about the same as their previous relationship, and ultimately have a violent breakup. However, I don't think they would redo the procedure, knowing that they might just find their way back to each other. They acknowledge at the end of the film that they're not right for each other, but that they want to experience the relationship anyway.Second, I don't think that Mary did the right thing in mailing out the tapes. The problem with this situation is that you could argue that what she did was ethical or unethical. There may have been occasions where the clients realized they didn't want to erase their memories, and would want the tapes back, but there definitely were some clients who were forced to remember things that were painful or even life-ruining. Mary no longer agreed with the practice of erasing memories, but there were other things that she could have done. She could have spoken to the press and attempted to ruin the company's reputation, instead of possibly ruining the lives of its former clientele. Of course, without her intervention, Joel and Clementine's relationship could form a cycle; they get together, then break up, then forget each other, then get together, and so on, and so on until they no longer can. I still believe that what she did was not ethical however, as a cycle wouldn't be formed if she ruined the company's reputation.\n",
      "425\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind absolutely exceeded my expectations. I was expecting your average romantic drama film about tormented lovers struggling to stay together, but Micheal Gondry took it in a completely different direction.\n",
      "Instantly, the slight Sci-Fi element appealed to me. Certain shots and sets were impressive, testing the boundaries between CGI and live action. The plot bounced between flashbacks and present time, confusing viewers including myself. But by geniusly using Clem's hair as a way to map out the timeline, it provided a subtle way to comprehend the story.\n",
      "The end of the film was an unexpected twist, as Mary returns the tapes to Clem, Joel and the other patients. I don't think Mary made the right choice. Everyone who underwent the procedure agreed to it, and some people did it for their own good, not just to spite them like Clen did. Mary made her choice based on her own emotions, which was her anger toward Howard. She felt robbed of her memories, and decided that everyone else did too. A lot of people made their own choice to erase the memory of someone and didn't want to remember, but now they're forced too. They all agreed to the procedure, even Mary.\n",
      "The end also brought Joel and Clem back together, only for them to discuss that they'd probably end up breaking up again. Joel says he doesn't care, implying that no matter what happens, he just wants to be with her. I think that in the future, now knowing their past mistakes and grudges against each other, they'd stay together. Seeing how much Joel wanted to remember her and seeing Clem help him in his mind, you know they're made for each other.\n",
      "Gordy does an amazing job telling such a complex, intertwining story and making it comprehensible and interesting to viewers. It leaves you satisfied, yet craving more. You want to see more of Clem and Joel in their past, other people finding out about their lost memories and what happened to Mary, Howard and Patrick in the end. Although you want more, it's a great way to end this film, leaving the future up to your imagination.\n",
      "426\n",
      "The male lead Joel is an ordinary person who usually lives at three points and one line, the female lead Clem is enthusiastic and generous. She and the man are two people with completely different personalities. But in this way, two people with different personalities are deeply attracted to each other, but because of the differences in personalities, they have many disagreements and differences in life. But I think that most people will find that many of them are beautiful and worthy of love and acceptance of one's self.This film is not so much a love story as philosophy. Deleted memories cannot be deleted love. I remember in the movie they were lying on the thick ice to study the stars in the sky. \"When you see a baby, she is so pure, how free, how clean, and the adult is like a collection of sadness and fear.\" \"The forgotten world wiped out this world, the beauty of the soul Infinite sunshine, accept every prayer, and respond to every wish. \"\n",
      "This film made me re-examine my emotional world. Can't patronize quarrels without paying attention to your original intentions, and you can't deny everything because of a small thing\n",
      "427\n",
      "I personally found it enjoyable to watch and found myself intrigued on how the well thought-out the film was.To be honest, in the beginning of the movie I found myself wondering if this is the typical romantic movie that I always end up seeing in a fictional world. The guy meets the girl, an obstacle and some misunderstandings, then all of a sudden they're happy together. That's what I thought of what the movie would bring, however it surprised me with a realistic turn in it.The characters go through something so realistic to an adult's everyday life when it comes to relationships. There are good and bad moments that are portrayed perfectly in this film that everyday couples will and have experienced at some point in their lives. The timeline and small Easter Eggs that were shown were quite surprising and it felt like everything in my brain just \"Clicked\" as everything was coming full circle when it came to the timeline of the film.I'll admit I'm not a big movie fan, however I do recommend this film to anyone, as I think it's message will be a good lesson and the audience may have a sense of relating to the characters in a way.\n",
      "428\n",
      "Overall, I really enjoyed this film. Both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey did a good job of acting, and the plot was very interested, if a bit hard to follow due to the timeline being cut up. The tip with the hair colour was really helpful to help figure out the timeline, and a fun addition to help the plot. I also really appreciated how the movie started of under the guide as a regular love story, and then evolves into an odd, almost science fiction type movie with very surreal effects. The transitions between scenes were very aesthetically pleasing, such as when he gone from the bookshop into the living room.\n",
      "I would really like to believe that Clementine and Joel will stay together the second time they meet. However, I don't think that's going to be the reality of the situation. Considering how easily they both seem to get into fights, and how impulsive Clementine is with erasing all memories of Joel the first time, their relationship most likely turn out.\n",
      "As for Mary returning the tapes, I believe it was the right thing to do. Who knows how many people were in the same situation as Joel, regretting erasing their memories as it was happening. Peoples experiences in life shape who they are, and it's important that they keep those memories to make them more well rounded people.\n",
      "429\n",
      "The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a confusing movie at times, but when the credits start rolling you are as satisfied as you could be. During the first parts of the film I have to be honest, I was confused. But then as the movie continued, even with its different form of narrative in which the events are all tangled up it was easy to follow.\n",
      "What the film does best is how it makes you question you own actions in the past, and if given with the option to forget or change it, would you? I, for one thought a lot about some of my past actions that I wish I could do something about. When you know the outcome of an event it really makes you wonder what you could have done differently and how that would affect you in the present.\n",
      "Jim Carrey's acting is great in the film, as you can really relate to him and his conflict, and how he is unsure and shy. The way I see it, Joel and Clementine compliment each other. Joel is soft-spoken and careful, and Clementine speaks her mind and always goes with the moment. Together they have experiences that they wouldn't have had if they weren't together, as she makes him live more and takes him out of his seemingly boring life. He helps her stay in the moment, but I think that overall Clementine gave Joel more than he did to her. His life turns interesting and he does things he would have never done otherwise.\n",
      "An interesting thing of the film is the other storyline of Mary, Stan and Dr. Howard. It's interesting because Mary had her memory erased and moved on in life and started dating Stan, but as she learned the truth this life she had been living collapsed. In my opinion her decision to give everyone their memories was not the correct one. Like these people have most likely moved on, and yes, they might have lost precious memories, but it was their decision and maybe they are happy now. Maybe some people fought back the procedure inside their head, like Joel did, but not everyone, who knows what the erased from their mind. Maybe their memories were extremely painful to remember, and because of this I believe this decision was not the morally correct one.\n",
      "Finally, at the end of the film Joel and Clementine will give it another chance at being together after their memories have been returned. Personally I think that the two of them will be able to work it out as a pair and stay together, as they will learn from their previous mistakes. Regardless of this, the most important learnings are that of taking risks, giving second chances and to hold on to that that makes you feel happy and complete\n",

      "This is, hands down, the best American film ever made. Whether it's the best film ever made globally is more debatable. I first saw this film in the theater when it was released, and I admittedly didn't follow the plot correctly. But even not comprehending the plot logically, I still immensely enjoyed it, so touching and relatable is its emotional impact. Repeated watches allowed for appreciation of the plot itself; the film's adherence to logic and lack of plot holes makes it all the more impressive. Fifteen years later, life experiences make rewatching this film more powerful still. Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the screenplay, is a genius, and humanity desperately needs more films written by him.\n",
      "431\n",
      "What is the meaning of life? Is it learning from our mistakes, tucking them away, or growing? Could it be described in a single statement? Or a well planned theory? A theory that teaches us to embrace that everything that happens in life brings us closer to who we are. Without these occurrences, without the regret, we could never be the same. The film Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless Mind, not only touches on these topics, but chooses to explore this particular theory and its consequences. Rightfully so, I have chosen to describe this piece as a film because it touches on topics that are much greater than oneself. After watching this piece, I felt myself debating the concept of regret. If you could really erase anything from your past, would you? This film seeks out an idea that with the bad, comes the good of change. A place that can only be reached through experience, and most often times mistakes. Above its reflection upon human nature and life, I thought the film to be really well planned out. It was organized in such a way to manipulate the viewer into believing various timelines, which I found to be a very intriguing concept. The beginning of the film, is not the beginning, but a mere do over of the characters life. It is not till the end that you realize this. To keep up with these changes of the mind, the creators of the film have incorporated Clementine's hair color as a guide towards emotion, and the timing of an event. I thought this movie to be very touching. It was a heart warming love story with an indefinite end. Although the characters have only minor memories of their time together, it is promising that they would attempt a happy life together, which is all that you can really do in life. Try. As the viewer, I would like to believe that Clementine and Joel stay together after the end of the film. I feel that for Joel, the desperation of almost completely losing the love of his life will have an impact on his mind. When ever he feels unhappy with Clementine, a buried impulse could possibly kick in, reminding him to fight for her. As for the reason why Clementine and Joel remember each other in the first place, I can't say that I completely agree with this decision. Near the end of the film, Mary hands out all of the tapes and reminds the patients of what they had tried to forget, due to a rash decision that she made after experiencing mixed emotions about the things that she just recently remebered. I believe that this was not her right. Although this decision worked out for our main characters, their are many others who had lost loved ones, or just simply had good reason to want to start a new life. For most, they made the decision to clean their mind for the greater good of themselves. Mary revealing these decisions is just opening up old wounds and complicating lives. For these reasons, I do not consider Marys actions to be justifiable. Overall, with this promising review, I only rate the movie an 8 out of 10. This is because, I felt that many scenes were unnecessary. I did not feel as though the relationship between the woman receptionist (Mary), and the assistant doctor (Rob), contributed anything powerful to the story. In many of the scenes when Joel is enduring his mind warping treatment, I would have liked to see a few more scenes of Joel and Clementine, rather than a drunken date night between two secondary characters. At first, the contrast between the stress of Joel's mind and this light hearted fun appeared to be quite funny. After about the second time, it got old. Regardless, I still really enjoyed this film. I would highly recommend it, and consider watching again, this time with a much more critical eye\n",

      "A man (Jim Carrey) discovers that his babe (Kate Winslet) had her memory of their relationship removed via the medical procedures of an innovative company. He decides to get the surgery as well, but as the technicians (Mark Ruffalo & Elijah Wood) conduct the procedure he changes his mind! Can he escape with his memory intact and possibly save the relationship? Tom Wilkinson plays the doctor and Kirsten Dunst the secretary.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004) is a drama/sci-fi/romance hybrid that's so confusing during its first half that it fails to captivate (and is even annoying) but, if you persevere, everything starts making sense by the midpoint, ushering in an entertaining and insightful second half. The movie's depth naturally makes it improve on repeat viewings wherein it's more understandable as you put the pieces together.Viewers who complain that a certain person is too dramatic, selfish and high maintenance to put up with for more than a month didn't get the closing moral, which is both true and profound: Couples can (and should) realize the flaws of their mate, which they genuinely don't like, but it's \"Okay.\" That's true love.There are also unexpected peripheral gems on unethical behavior in a supposedly professional environment, secret relationships, discarding unwanted skeletons, and more. Lastly, curvy, vivacious Winslet shines and it's nice to see Carrey in a serious role.The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in the New York City area (Yonkers, Montauk, Mount Vernon, Manhattan and Brooklyn).GRADE: A-\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind seems to be told in a careless way, with a certain documentary effect, similar to the French Nouvelle Vague from the 50's.The use of low-key lighting is very noticeable with minimal use of artificial light, abrupt cuts and disordered timing. The presence of the camera has a well-marked purpose. Becoming the eyes of the spectator, the hand-held camera takes us though each scene and makes us part of the plot.No attempt is made to make the photography 'beautiful' or appealing. In fact, by making the surroundings look monotonous, an atmosphere of extreme tension is created. This is enhanced by the frequent use of sepia tones and grays, emphasizing the character's depressed state of mind. In this way, when cold tonalities are used, accompanied by extreme long shots, the stature of the character is diminished and minimized, especially when placed into a usually deserted and monochromatic background.In terms of montage, the story is told in a non-chronological way, using flashbacks and flashforwards. The montage seems to be experimental. The abrupt cuts in single scenes, serve to make the editing appear more accidental and spontaneous. The acceleration of time, the quick combination of shots and the introduction of absurd elements, characterize the oneiric scenes and manages to create a surrealistic atmosphere.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind cements itself in the rare category of being equally thought provoking and unique. The movie chronicles a deteriorating relationship through the memories of Joel Barish and what it is able to accomplish is simply astounding to me. It simultaneously shows two flawed characters learn why their relationship is so important while trying to destroy it completely. A major theme within the story would be how nothing lasts forever. Their first relationship seemed like it would last at first but over time Joel and Clementine began to grow apart. However, the memory erasing procedure allowed for Joel to relive his most prominent relationship in his otherwise monotonous life. This I think is what makes the movie so incredibly powerful. The atmosphere would be incredibly sad but the soundtrack and directing give it a much more whimsical feel. The spontaneous tendencies of the characters I think mimics how Kaufman perceives life to be. Once both Joel and Clementine have erased each other, they are still drawn to each other subconsciously. This analysis of the human psyche is one of my favorite aspects of the movie. How cosmic and irrational relationships can be.Needless to say I love this movie to death and could not recommend it enough. I think the Charlie Kaufman is one of the most essential writers in Hollywood.\n",

      "Directed by Michel Gondry. Starring Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson, David Cross, Jane Adams, Thomas Jay Ryan. (R)Upon learning that his ex-girlfriend (Winslet) underwent a procedure to have him erased from her memories, Carrey requests that they do the same with his memories of her, but starts feeling regrets mid-removal. Original, highly inventive script (netting screenwriter Charlie Kaufman an Academy Award) is dense, dizzying, and full of clever twists and revelations, jumping back and forth not just between time periods but also between reality and imagination. Character development is limited, and its notions of love seem focused on memories of events/moments more than the deeper connections and contemplations identified in societal definitions of \"heart\" and \"soul\" (and its fascinations more invested in the translation of mental information than the capricious nature of emotional dominance), but so be it. Gondry matches these ideas with freewheeling visual ingenuity, Ellen Kuras' restless camera catching countless shots that will be remembered for years to come. Carrey and Winslet are both cast against type but deliver unforgettable performances, backed by a strong supporting cast. Whether it's judged as sublimely romantic or bitterly anti-romantic depends more on the eye of the beholder than the creative minds at work here.88/100\n",

      "The best adjective for this film has been very difficult to be found but in the end what appeared on my mind was \"bizarre\".\n",
      "Michel Gondry's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a bizarre but wonderful movie, a very remarkably unforgettable experience. In the whole movie the main charachters are played by Jim Carrey,whose role is very well performed -even if his previous performance let the audience know him like the \"Ace Ventura man\" and only a comedian- and then the amazing Kate Winslet who's one of the best actress in the whole world of the cinema. As the previews illustrate this movie is about a complicated love story,but it is far more than this: Joel (Jim Carrey) who plans to forget memories of his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), erased by a new company called Lacuna, after he discovers that she herself has had the procedure performed only a week before, but during the operation he relives memories of Clementine that he struggles to let them go. One of the aspects that impresses me eveytime I watch this film is its special \"disturbing\" effects that reflect really good the deep message behind the film which lot of people hardly undestand.\n",
      "After all it's good to say that it's better to have the pleasure of watching this entire emotional expierence at the right moment because it could involve a lot people who can appreciate it.\n",
      "In the end I consider this one of the best film I've ever seen beacuse of its message, realistic love story and sci-fi elements as well.\n",
      "439\n",
      "The movie evokes a fundamental ethic question which is: Should we be able to change reality, our past, our feelings and parts of our conscience? The answer given here is that deep feelings like love cannot be erased, or any part of conscience itself. We should not try and change our past or destroy memories. We see in this film how Joel hurts himself and that at some point during the procedure he regrets making this choice. Even in the end when it's all \"erased\", Joel and Clementine end up finding each other and falling in love in a very odd and unusual way. We could say that they both \"tricked the system\" while being in Joel's brain. And that's why they ended up finding each other. But Howard's case with Mary is confirming once again that love cannot be erased from a person's soul; Mary has an odd crush on her boss after she suffered the same program.It is also possible and logical to believe the movie is saying love can be pure, and once that kind of love is found it is eternal. Because in Joel's conscience we find out that not only he made a wrong choice that he regrets, but that Clementine doesn't want him to forget her too. They both regret it. Joel dives in his conscience while being \"asleep\" and there he understands he truly loves Clementine, and she does too. At the very end of the movie, when they both understand and see what each has done to himself and the other, the two lovers end up laughing. In the final shot, we see them playing together on the snowy cost of Montauq; they end up being together, no matter all that happened.So this film says that love, or any feeling is not erasable, or maybe that real love exists and that it's there, in a person's absolute pure conscience and it's there forever.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a very different movie for me. It's like a journey, that I never be tired of exploring it. So emotional, so strong. Watch it before you die if you want to find out what true love is. Because this movie shows real love with pure emotions.\n",

The casting, camera work, writing direction etc. is all top notch.this film does such a good job making these characters feel real. And the sequences when he's dreaming are all prime examples of how to do great visual storytelling almost without saying a word.This movie is now i think one of my favorite movies of all time. Simply because of the excellent writing and payoffs. It's also a great example of a movie that actually asks you questions and then giving the answers later. This movie shows you a question (2+2) and then that questions is set in your mind to think what the answer might be, and at the perfect time shows you the answer (4). And this answer isn't an answer you never would've thought of, it's the answer you thought was a small possibility but didn't actually think it was right. So that twist didn't seem completely weird and you actually get sort of satisfied.This movie is one the most enjoyable and easy to watch fun movies I've seen in a while, and at the same time it was really tough.\n",

      "This movie has different elements that I found quiet appealing. It motivates me to enjoy my relationship, and to learn more to articulate my feelings, mainly evocated by watching this film.The contrast on the images helped me to set aside details that might not be relevant for the story. The story has different elements that are bound: love, memory, anger, decisions, feelings, intuition, love. It is about the mystic love experience of a couple. The love is cultivated with the daily interaction of the couple but memory plays an important role to keep the love alive or to feed the dark side of our feelings (anger). With anger we feel motivated to make some decisions that we might regret. (Warning: possible spoiler) Anyway, it is so beautiful to see that love, somehow, finds its way to \"shine\" regardless of lack of memories, or even in presence of bad memories.\n",

The film presents a unique and original premise through a fascinating structure that makes us think about how it works, how it goes, how it follows.Eternal Sunshine is a film full of originality, fantastic cinematography and a unique script complemented by fascinating performances, highlighting the incredible performance of Jim Carrey, which I consider to be the best of all the ones he has made in his movies. This is a film that highlights Jim's emotional and dramatic abilities to bring to life a character totally different from those he has personified during his career as an actor. This film is, of course, a romantic film, which is based especially on the value of memories and the need to overcome problems rationally and effectively. Showing us a bizarre journey through memories, memories and imaginations, the film transports us to a unique and fascinating narrative that resembles a dreamlike journey through dreams.Full of iconic phrases, fantastic moments, deep messages and strong emotions, it is a complete film in both technical and creative aspects, offering an excellent quality to satisfy the tastes of those seeking a unique, original and sentimental film; a down to earth representation of feelings and love.It is one of my favorites for a good reason; it is original, pure poetry and beauty captured with a unique narrative full of emotions and fascinating scenes.\n",

They form a wonderful relationship, until she undergoes a procedure to erase Joel from her memory. This upsets Joel, so he decides to do the same thing. Three people Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst), and Patrick (Elijah Wood), operate on Joel, and Joel seems to slowly forget about Clementine, but also goes through parts of his life and tends to fall in love with her all over again.This movie is well directed by Michael Gondry, and shows a great theme of love, passion, and loss. Carrey and Winslet do wonderful jobs not only at playing their characters, but having really brilliant chemistry. The other actors did a great job as well, and the movie had a really good cast altogether.The story was well developed, and similar to The Truman Show, I recommend watching it twice because it's made in a way to confuse you at first, but when you watch it again, you can understand and appreciate it a whole lot more.Overall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is no Truman Show, but is a beautifully made movie and holds up 15 years later.\n",

Being our main story line the story of the love of Joel and Clementine this is not narrated chronologically, using conflict as a starting point to learn the history of the protagonists through the use of flashbacks, until the end where the time of history and narrative time converge.

      "Expect a bit of a weird script from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, since it was co-written by Charlie Kaufman. While some of his films are just too strange for me to enjoy, this one is very good. The premise is so intriguing, everyone who watches it can't help but wish it could really happen in real life. Imagine a procedure that could erase certain selected memories. You talk to the doctor, explain what you want to remove, bring in objects or your diary that make you recall those memories, and as those parts of your brain light up in recognition, he removes them. Isn't that fantastic?Unfortunately, it's only a movie, despite the very realistic infomercial of Tom Wilkinson telling you all about the simple procedure. In the imaginative movie, people can go to Dr. Wilkinson's office and remove any memory of a painful breakup; letters will be sent to their friends informing them of the operation and requesting that they never try to remind them since it will only cause confusion. Once the memories have been erased, so has the memory of visiting the doctor, otherwise the person might wonder what it was they wanted to forget.Doesn't this premise make you want to rent it? I don't have to tell you Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are the fantastic dramatic leads, or that the entire cast gives wonderful performances. I don't have to entice you with the supporting cast of Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Jane Adams, David Cross, and Kirsten Dunst. Tom is perfectly cast as the trustworthy doctor, and Kirsten takes a small but memorable role that's different from the parts she's played in her teenaged career. You'll want to rent it without knowing anything else about it, won't you? Good, but don't watch it with your sweetie pie, as it might make for a very awkward evening.\n",

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind follows Joel after he has broken up with his long term girlfriend Clementine and has fallen into deep sadness before realizing she has had him erased from her memory and decides to do the same with her. Eternal sunshine decides to take on the topic of break ups but somehow doesn't manage to give off a negative and bleak moral but actually a heartfelt and uplifting one. Eternal sunshine can be quite melancholic at times as to be expected from a film about breakups but it also presents memory's of happy and sweet moments in Joel's life spliced in so the film doesn't have a to bleak outlook. Jim Carrey in one of his only serious roles is incredible as the quiet anti-social Joel and has amazing chemistry with his co star Kate Winslet who also gives in an amazing performance as the eccentric Clementine. The directing and effects is amazing in the film with moments in Joel's mind having things disappear in frame being especially memorable. But ultimately the story is king in this film with a beautiful melancholic yet heartwarming moral at the center of it and an incredible performance from the two leads.\n",

Or would you undergo a procedure to erase them from your memory; permanently!? This quirky women, Clementine (Winslet), does just that to Joel (Carrey). Later and after running into her and her treating him like a casual stranger, he learns what she did and out of frustration and spite he decides to do the same. He locates this semi-professional targeted memory erasing business. During the erasing process there is interference between the memories and the people doing the erasing and the worlds sort of overlap. During the process the man decides to change his mind as his true love for Clementine still is strong. He and his memory of Clementine try to outrace and outsmart the erasing process. Can he still save his memories of her? Being directed by Gondry, the world is in his mind and is surreal, disorienting and like a dream at times. Really neat stuff. The unique soundtrack fit in nicely as well.

That they lose their minds while all about them are keeping theirs is a tribute to their skill; they center their characters so that we can actually care about them even when they're constantly losing track of their own lives.\n",
      "The movie is a radical example of Maze Cinema, that style in which the story coils back upon itself, redefining everything and then throwing it up in the air and redefining it again. To reconstruct it in chronological order would be cheating, but I will cheat: At some point before the technical beginning of the movie, Joel and Clementine were in love, and their affair ended badly, and Clementine went to Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) at Lacuna Inc., to have Joel erased from her mind.\n",
      "Discovering this, Joel in revenge applies to have his memories of her erased. But the funny thing about love is, it can survive the circumstances of its ending; we remember good times better than bad ones, and Joel decides in mid-process that maybe he would like to remember Clementine after all. He tries to squirrel away some of his memories in hidden corners of his mind, but the process is implacable.\n",
      "For Jim Carrey, this is another successful attempt, like \"The Truman Show\" and the underrated \"The Majestic,\" to extend himself beyond screwball comedy. He has an everyman appeal, and here he dials down his natural energy to give us a man who is so lonely and needy that a fragment of memory is better than none at all. Kate Winslet is the right foil for him, exasperated by Joel's peculiarities while paradoxically fond of them. The shenanigans back at Lacuna belong on a different level of reality, but even there, secrets are revealed that are oddly touching.\n",

      "This movie is basically talking about when Joel and Clementine, the couple, find that they are not happy with each other and decide to erase their memory, and when they meet again in the place where they meet in the dream, and restart their love. And something interesting is another story line, the married doctor who is responsible for erasing Joel's memory and his assistant Mary were lovers before, but Mary erase her memory about this. After she finds out this, she sends all the records about Joel's memory to Joel, which lead to their disagreement at the end of the movie.\n",
      "For my opinion, this movie is more likely to be a love story instead of an science fiction movie. The movie states a dilemma in love. Joel loves Clementine, he doesn't want to delete her from his memory, but there is conflict in the reality, there is no perfect love. The longer two lovers love, the more problem there is. As long as they just see the problem of the love, it becomes torture instead of happiness. So, how to deal with love?\n",
      "Just like Romeo and Juliet, Joel can't live without forgetting Clementine. But there is so much that two lovers disagree about, they both know that they hurt each other. Joel says that Clementine is an uneducated bold girl, Clementine says that Joel is a extremely boring man. At the end Clementine says that i am just a bad girl who wants to find a peaceful soul, and Joel says OK, they face each other and cry. Even they are back to reality, and become strangers, they still try to love each other, at the end they still give each other an other chance to start again. Lovers should not always focus on the small problem, just like what happens in the movie, when they are trying to delete his mind, Joel finally realize that there is a lot more happy memory they have, way more than those small problems.\n",
      "Flaws in Joel and Clementine's relationship are inevitable but decide that they are meant to be together nonetheless. Love means that they should forgive each other with small problems, people always realized how sweet they were after they break up. The most touching part in the movie, is when Joel and Clementine walk on the beach at Montauk, they enjoy the time spent on each other. I think if each lovers can remind themselves how awesome he or she is by accepting the problems ,imperfection and dilemma in love, there will be a perfect love, and spotless minds.the memory deleting is not just a meaningless thought, it is also a reflection of reality. I believe that two lovers will forgive each others' problem and meet each other just like they've never met. In my opinion, the name of the movie is not an irony, but to express how an imperfect love create spotless minds, how faulty minds make perfect love.\n",

      "BUT !!! Well I don't remind why I choose to watch it the first time, not a Carrey fanatic, who's Michel Gondry ? and another romantic comedy !!! Ten thousand have been shot since WW2, Well I loved Truman show and I surely thought, maybe another weird movie.The filming is sometimes wrong, the editing is all mixed up, the fx they made better ones in the 19th century, the haircuts are no go zones, it begins with the beginning of the end, flashbacks rain litterely, revisited flashbacks, 30 years ago for making such a movie you would have ended in jail !But, anytime she whispers \"meet me in Montauk\", I have tears in my eyes. And I can watch it twice with the same pleasure. I have it on dvd and bought the BR for the extras ! And Jim is great in it. Try to figure Marlon Brando or Hugh Jackman instead of Jim Carrey, it wouldn't work that well, he's awesome ! Of course if you expect a kind of \"Pretty woman\" romantic comedy, don't, just don't.\"Meet me in Montauk\" and I get the shivers, it works every time...And don't believe me, the filming, the editing, the narration are tremendous, I was just jokingI wish I have 10 movies like this one to watch before I go...\n",

      "Both Carrey and Winslet are brilliant here, very touching relationship between the two. The plot is quite twisted, maybe a bit too constructed at times, but an intriguing mind journey that is nicely visualized.\n",
      "474\n",
      "This is one of my favorite love stories. This quirky tale is a unique approach to what happens after a breakup. Jim Carrey is fantastic in this movie playing neurotic Joel. Joel falls in love with Clementine (Winslet), who is a strong female character. She's everything Joel isn't. The differences that pulled them together eventually tore the apart. Though they loved each other, the spark was gone. Break-ups are hard, especially when the only reason is that you're no longer compatible. Clementine opted to have her memories of Joel erased instead of dealing with the heart break. Joel eventually follows suit and this is where we see, through Joel's memories, of the highlights and lowlights of their relationship. This is a fascinating, unique, and quirky approach to love. You root for Joel and hope for the best for them. There's a side story happening that breaks up the scenes with Joel's memory erasing that grounds you back to reality that focuses on another relationship. Mark Ruffolo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood also have performances in here as well. This is a movie to watch to the end to experience the full effect of it. It ties up everything in a way that's incredibly satisfying.\n",

      "Finally back on my quest for the IMDB 2005 Oscar's badge, the next film on the list was \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" which won Best Original Screenplay that year.After discovering that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had their relationship expunged from her mind, Joel (Jim Carrey) decides to undergo the same procedure. Whilst seemingly asleep, Joel experiences his memories being deleted like a fractured dream, during which he decides that he still loves Clementine and he's made a mistake. Desperate, he tries to cling to his memories whilst confused technicians Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) try to complete the extraction.It's been a while since I'd seen \"Sunshine\", though I did watch the series \"Kidding\" towards the end of last year, which share some similarities and I loved that. To be honest, it took a while for the film to win me over, although it did before the end. Though Carrey is great, it's Kate Winslet's performance that I'd forgotten about. Initially I misremembered her character as being the \"Indie Pixie love interest\" that would become a trope a few years later, but she isn't really like that. She becomes an appealing character, or at least the version of her in Joel's memories is, and it's clear why Joel would repeatedly fall for her, but she also does appear to be very impulsive, perhaps to the point of being bipolar. That said, I think much of my initial apathy to the film came from seeing their initial connection (or perhaps reconnection) and not really feeling it was all that plausible.So, why did it win me over? I guess because I eventually found myself invested in that central love story, in wanting Joel to find a way to overcome his decision and keep his memories. You combine that with some excellent practical effects (techniques that Gondry still employs today) it makes for a truly memorable experience. (In fairness, some of the digital effects haven't aged quite as well as the practical ones). What I do find extraordinary is how few films we've had from the mind of Charlie Kaufman since that early 2000's period, including \"Being John Malkovich and \"Adaptation\" was a hell of run, with two nominations to go with the previously mentioned best original screenplay win. Why we've only had one full feature since then presumably has to be his choice?Beautiful and memorable, though at bit patchy at the start, its charm may win you over, as it did me.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is my favorite film. The film was written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry. It stars Jim Carrey as Joel Barish and Kate Winslet as his girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski. The film won Oscar in 2005 for Best Writing - Original Screenplay. In addition the film won 72 awards and was nominated 109 categories in the various awards. The film is set in New York. It was filmed on location in New York and in New Jersey.The film is about the estranged couple who have erased each other from their memories and then fell in love again. The couple, Joel and Clementine meet in Montauk and they fall in love. One day, Clementine dumps Joel. After that Clementine is erased all memories about the Joel from her mind at Lacuna Inc. the clinic. When Joel found out this situation, he gets angry and decides to be erased all memories about the Clementine from his mind in Lacuna Inc., too. During this procedure, suddenly Joel wants to stop erasing process but it's impossible. The procedure is completed. Joel wakes up and goes to Montauk. Joel and Clementine meet again and fall in love again.This is very short summary of the film. The film includes many details and impressive dialogues. Especially my favorite quote is \"Joel, hide me in your humiliation!\" Also, I love the film's soundtrack, \"Everybody's Got to Learn Sometimes\" is performed by Beck.Finally, If you haven't seen this film, you must see! I strongly recommend it...\n",

      "This is such a great quirky movie and all the credit must go to the writer Charlie Kauffman who is fast becoming a one man force to be reckoned with. A unique romantic comedy, unfettered by the normal expectations of the genre, is a rare and wondrous thing. That's precisely what director Michel Gondry, working from a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman delivers. Without being too offbeat or esoteric, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind nevertheless manages to convey romance without forcing the mind to shift into neutral or dragging the characters through a formulaic structure where chemistry becomes the most important asset. It's willingness to flout conventions and eschew formulas is just one of many things to celebrate about this charmingly eccentric movie.\n",

      "This film is so intelligent on so many levels. The way the story is told and how it is presented is perfect.\n",
      "The story perfectly breaks down the concept of love by using a non-naturalistic Sci-Fi concept. It's very unique. The type of love presented has been seen hundreds of times before but never like this. The way it shows how they only chose to forget eachother (because of the bad things) is because they had the chance to forget eachother. They realised that they wanted to remember the good things, not forget it all because of the bad things.\n",
      "The directing and visuals in this film are amazing; with a naturalistic style in the real world and a Non-naturalistic style when it is inside the character's mind.The only slight complaint I have is that it takes a little time to reach the main story; but this is understandable, as it takes a while to set up a concept like this.Overall this film is great. The more I think About it, the more I love it.\n",

In which he gives one of his best performances of his career, playing an introvert, lonely and melancholic character.Kate Winslet, Clementine, is the more crazy girlfriend that fills the protagonsit¬¥s boring life with her... craziness. Not a fan of characters like her, but she works greatly on this storyline. This almost reach a sense magic realism or even surrealism, it establishes a world where unreal things like an institution that erases memories and dream-memory scenery happen without questioning.All to tell a very basic but somewhat not very common message.\n",

      "Ever been in a bad relationship? You might just want to erase it from your memory. Well, you can't. But what if you could? What if you could just erase the memory of a person from your brain overnight? Esteemed writer Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry explore this possibility in their film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Bolstered by career-defining performances from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, the film is a comedic and heartstring-tugging experience that examines human relation and companionship. We open with a look inside the life of Joel (Jim Carrey). He wakes up one morning and begins to get ready for work. We get the sense he's pretty boring and never really does anything besides work and sleep. But today he decides to skip and go out on an adventure. On his adventure, he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), a fellow oddball that likes to talk and get personal. The two of them couldn't be more opposite, so naturally, that's what makes them attract. Their relationship initially starts out rough, but after some time it blossoms into something serious.And then the hard part comes. They can't stand each other anymore and decide to call it quits. Joel, taking things very hard, decides to undergo a strange procedure he heard about that can erase the memory of a person from your brain. As he tries to erase Clementine from his memory, Joel's mind reflects on his past and teaches him the merits of true love and how nothing ever works out perfectly. This is probably one of the most emotional films you'll ever watch. The relationship between Joel and Clementine is presented with such love and tenderness that will endlessly play with your feelings. There isn't a dull moment between the two of them. They're in a cycle of getting close, growing apart, and reconnecting, rinse and repeat. While it is predictable, it never feels repetitive. This is down to Gondry's ability to give each rotation a new spin through the use of the camera and visual effects. They're used sparsely throughout, but always at the right time with great effect. The shining moment of this comes from Joel's escape from Barnes & Noble through a seemingly magic door that leads directly to his house. It's a great sequence with lots of intricate techniques that come together neatly. Another element that works for the film is the questions it raises and the answers it gives. The beginning is muddled with the questionable and strange. From there we are slowly led down a path through the mess of human emotion. From this mess, we find our answers, ones that make you take a good look at yourself and the people in your life. It's not hokey or overplayed, it's gripping and used well within the context of the story. One problem that arises a couple of times throughout is the inability to solely focus on one relationship. You know the central pairing is Joel and Clementine, but there are actually about three other insignificant pairings that crop up from time to time. Now I'm not going to say who's involved in each one, but what I will say is that every time we were not watching Joel and Clementine is when the story loses some steam.The performances in this film are some of the strongest I've seen, and that credit definitely goes to our two leads. Jim Carrey breaks his usual routine as the rubber-faced madman and gives us a character that is sad, lonely, and complex. He still gets to use his antics from time to time, but he's mainly subdued and able to personally open up as a person.Kate Winslet plays his perfect opposite. She's rambunxious and overly dramatic, but you can always say that she means well. Winslet goes all the way, giving us a performance that is also different from expectations.Even though you never really get the sense of it, there is a good sized supporting cast always present. Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are the strongest small players that are able to showcase their skills. While his character isn't well written, Elijah Wood does a pretty good job being the creepy weirdo among charming weirdos. Finally, Tom Wilkinson plays the straight part as the head doctor behind the procedure.Kaufman's got another hit on his hands. He's made one of the most important and educational relationship films out there. It holds a mirror up to you and makes you feel insecure about you and your past. If you're a person that doesn't easily open up, you might need this film. Even if you don't need it, still see it, it deserves your attention.\n",

      "Eternal sunshine is a mind twisting filmthat leaves you questioning future possibilities. There is something quite addictive about this film that will require many revisits. I love this side to Jim Carrey and with a whole array of other big names, this film is a must see!\n",
      "492\n",
      "Don't you love when a simple film makes you cry? What a breathtaking piece of art! So great it makes you forget that Jim Carrey is the same actor as in Mask. The main beauty of this film is that it's so brutal because it's true, it get's you in a very personal level. I can say, it made me almost angry as I felt an extreme invasion of privacy, which you may say is absolutely pathetic since everything in this film is impossible. But that's exactly what great films do, right? Make the impossible, possible, in a way you can feel absolutely every emotion. It even makes me want to be called Clementine!\n",
      "Thank you Mr. Kaufman, you truly are a genius!\n",

      "Eternal sunshine does a great job of sticking to a few central themes and delving deeply into them. I really liked the initial focus just on their relationship, and gradual expansion naturally in the same themes of memory, intimacy, and honesty in the workers of the company. I really liked the sequencing, particularly in the information they give you early in the movie. Acting performances were great all around, particularly Wilkinson, Carrey, and Dunst. I didn't find the explanation or depiction of Carrey running through his memory and evading them in his mind, fully aware. I also didn't think their central relationship was particularly well demonstrated. Nevertheless, it's an ambitious, fun, and successful movie in considering some fascinating and difficult ideas.\n",
      "494\n",
      "If you haven't seen this movie, you should. The strongest romance I've seen in that it incorporates the best feelings of initially falling in love with the complex reality of a long term relationship. Through it's time travelling device it allows all of this to happen simultaneously in a way that's exciting and ultimately emotionally satisfying.\n",
      "495\n",
      "A great story about love and yet the same story about love. Just like many time traveling movies are about destiny. A conceptual thought that everything happens for a reason. Everything has the same purpose no matter how hard we try to change it. The nice thing about this movie is that the law of attraction breaks through anything we try to undo the past.If you are someone who loves to be mindfucked and yet wants to be moved by emotion, this is the movie for you.\n",

Charlie Kaufman is a genius and he wrote this amazing script that definitely deserves your money. All the actors are fantastic, and this is my favorite performance from Jim Carrey. The best way to go into this movie is to know as little as possible about it. I won't spoil the movie for you, but i]the plot twist is very unexpected. This movie is brilliant and deep. I absolutely recommend this film if you haven't seen it. I give this a 10/10\n",
      "497\n",
      "This is the perfect movie for me which inspires me something new each time I rewatch it, can't remember how many times I have watched it. The complication between lovers and relationship is, sad but beautiful, even though we know that love could hurt us badly that we wish we had never met each other, but love is something that somehow irrational and gives you courage for breaking the loop, or I can say, curse. Never know if it will succeed or not, but worth risking, isn't it? The best scene ever is the Okay and Okay. It forever bring me out of tears. We understand too much about each other , or the fate that we might face, but, okay, let's do it again, and why not? Argh, everyone who has deeply in love would found this movie somewhere can relate to, I love this, I love this deadly!! It's perfectly the eternal sunshine in my mind (tho mine is not spotless LOL).\n",

Furthermore, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have a unique chemistry that really works. You can definitely see how they can have problems but bring out another side to each other. The effects are also very good, and still hold up quite well. Just a fantastic film all together!\n",

Jim Carrey showcases his versatility for both the drama and the comedy with a great counterpart from Kate Winslet, delivering one of the most belivable and heartfelt relathionships to rise from the silver screen. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a film that celebrates both the unsecurity of love and the irrationality of the mind, and by doing so it becomes one of the greatest romantic films to come out from the 2000s, if not beyond that.\n",

Everything's just a masterpiece!

      "After realizing he agreed to completely erase his life partner from his mind, Joel finds himself in a terrible situation. Remorse comes into action, reaching the point where he struggles to keep her memory alive, while reliving and sometimes altering memories in which she was present. Unfortunately, as he struggles, many failures start piling, but all seems in vain, although he's desperate to cancel the procedure.A movie with a plot like this one is almost guaranteed to be a success but this one wasn't able to leave me a remarkable impression. It has tension and drama but it lacks emotion, and a movie in which you don't feel almost anything for the main characters, cannot be fully enjoyed it as you should. I don't quite know if the presentation or the characters are to blame, but they weren't able to create an emotional atmosphere which should keep you eager to find out its finale. As with many movies, it had a brilliant idea which wasn't fully exploited by the producers, thus leaving a dull sensation, even after its ending, which wasn't as conclusive as I hoped.\n",
      "508\n",
      "Michel Gondry tell this interwinding tale of memory with incredible skill. The plot itself, though seemingly complicated, is actually quite simple, and lends itself to a modest narrative about an ended relationship. But the way in which it is told is truly remarkable. Not many films are able to reach this level of sophistication in storytelling. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" creates philosophers out of all of us. It allows the audience to put the pieces together for themselves, and forces them to create their own interpretation. And it is a fun story that you can allow yourself to get lost in.\n",
      "509\n",
      "This some how manages to be the most unique and wonderful romantic comedy/drama ever but also the most depressing. Anyone who has ever gone through the break up of a serious relationship will identify with this film. Easily one of Jim Carrey's best roles. He masterfully handles the mix of drama and restrained humor.\n",

      "I don't really know why but I felt so strange at the end. I felt happy and sad at the same time I like I was new and different. I feel the same way every time I think about this stunning love story.By far and by my standards of a true and touching love story, Eternal sunshine is somewhere around the peek and maybe even the best love story I have ever watched. It is a combination of crushing sadness and euphoric happiness that are so well tight up together that you feel them both simultaneously. I have never before, in any other movie of this type, felt such a trill for the story and I never wanted more for a movie couple to be together at the end. They are so different, so loving, caring, gentle and still fierce, wild, weird... They seem like science fiction and yet so real.Joel and Clementine are two people that any can fall in love with. He shy and she 'like open book' are in my opinion a dream team. Their fight, struggle, sorrow and all that negativity is so amazing and touching that you just want with your whole heart that they find each other at the end and that they succeed.Only objection I had on this of twisted, mind blowing masterpiece is a non-described process of erasing memories. It is so superficial and basic that I didn't believe it is possible and I really wanted to believe that. Yet I just couldn't go harsh on great acting, great actors, great story with a lot of quality plot.\n",
      "511\n",
      "This movie is to me, one of the best romantic movies I've ever seen. It is unique and not tedious at all even though it had been a while since it came out. The complex order of story might seem a little confusing in the beginning, I think that the structure of the movie actually plays a big role in building up the emotions. And it adds to its distinctiveness by being sort of sci-fi. The story itself is very humorous, realistic, and relatable. The sci-fi element makes the realistic situations twisted and comical, and that makes it even more enjoyable to watch for the viewers. This movie also shows the state of mind and the thought process of a person going to the course of a relationship very well, allowing almost anyone to relate to it. This makes the movie especially attractive and touching. Also, the beautiful music and visuals play a role in bringing out the moods of different scenes, and make it more special.\n",

      "With Charlie Kaufman's always brilliant writing, Michel Gondry's beautiful direction, and Jim Carrey's haunting performance all culminating into a single work of magic art, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a must see. Kaufman's world is realistically populated through often funny and occasionally painful dialogue, interesting characters, and unexpected twists and turns. Kaufman is able to take full advantage of the cinematic art form by bending the conventions of film structure forming a work that combines narrative and nonlinear storytelling as well as brutal realism and wacky surrealism. This is not a film full of clich√©s, it is not a tragedy, nor is it a straight up comedy, but it contains a great bit of both. It is a film of reality; however, not in the sense that it is boring or painstakingly mundane, for it is quite the contrary. Through subtlety, foreshadowing, dialogue, etc., Kaufman is able to create a movie that is totally believable despite its strange concept.Although i am not the biggest fan of shaky cam, it is utilized in this film quite well. Michel Gondry's often disorienting, but still surprisingly visually appealing, use of hand-held camera-work allows viewers to drop themselves deeper into the film's bizarre storyline. If one were in the same state as Carrey's character is throughout much of the film, Gondry's camera-work and Kaufman's knack for absurdist detail would probably perfectly match their experience.Honestly, it is hard to put to words how unique this film is, which is sort of what makes it (and many other films that would film this category) unique. It is the type of film that would likely lure the curious with DESCRIPTIONS of its events, then utterly surprise them when these events occur, not because they're at all disappointing, but because of their context and relation to the film. I could describe various comical and surreal visuals that manage to provoke, astound, amuse, and possibly disturb, but it is more important that a reader seeks out this beautiful work if they have yet to see it. I am glad that it is so popular and widely praised among critics and audiences alike, and I hope its comic, melancholic, and hopeful charms reach an even further number of people, and I hope that I see more films of these kind being produced on a much more regular basis in the near future.\n",

      "I know it was fictional but still couldn't help myself hold my tears. I actually experienced falling in love with someone and losing it memory by memory from my past. It is like the saddest imaginable thing I can think about. The cast fits just fine I think. I think it would be a good start for people who definitely hate \"Romantic films\". Film starts a bit like a thriller at first but then things start to happen. If you realize little details like Clementine's hair colors during some specific emotions transmitted through specific scenes. Reminded me of Mr. Nobody.\n",

      "Warning may contain spoilers.How happy is the blameless vestals lot! The world forgetting by the world forgot Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned!Alexander pope speaks of the true happiness of a clean mind, even though they are trying to forget a world that already has forgotten them, their voices will be heard and those with clean souls will find its happiness.In relating the message of Alexander Pope and the values of its principles into a modern movie, Charlie Kaufmann, Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth are doing a magnificent job. To bring it to life with sheer precision and to carry the same morals through to the audience is a challenge that is quite well tackled by director Michel Gondry. Seated in the audience and understanding the concept of ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND took me quite some time. I kept flicking the rewind switch and re watching certain scenes over and over again to fathom what exactly was going on. This unorthodox directorial strategy to a very unorthodox screenplay makes it quite a challenge to understand. Once you are onboard with Michel Gondry, then it's just an emotional wave through Joel's (Jim Carrey) and Clementine's (Kate Winslet) story. Two individuals who are isolated in society with very limited social relationships run into each other. In another paradigm it's two people who are trying to exist in a world that has forgotten those finds each other and falls in love. Joel and Clementine are only human and with time within their own world the walls begin to fall apart and they part their own ways. We have all experienced this, when someone we love dearly, leaves our lives all we do is to try and forget them entirely, just as so Clementine wishes to forget Joel and has her memory wiped away. However even in a world that has been artificially made forgotten the pure in spirit will find its soul mate.Jim Carrey and he alone could have pulled of this movie I believe. I am yet to see and be convinced of an actor who has many expressions as Jim Carrey does. His adaptive talent to characters within a character is the most distinctive tool that allows ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND for a smooth sail. Kate Winslet delivered what was expected, not to be sexist but nothing in her performance stood out as exceptional whereas for Jim Carrey he actually pulled it off playing an 8 year old.Soundtrack - The Only flaw that limited the emotions running wild was the lack of a soundtrack. CITY OF ANGELS, A WALK TO REMEMBER has the viewer's balling out purely since its soundtracks are superior to ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. How much does that affect overall movie? Is that why this movie has been forgotten?Title: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Directed by: Michel Gondry Starring: Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood & Kirsten Dunst Rated: R for language some drug use and sexual content Rating: 07/10 108 Minutes\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry collaborate to make what has become an all time favourite film of mine. Every time I see his movie I wonder what a fascinating mind Kaufman must have. How does he think up such original amazing stories? 'Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind' tells the love story of two people, a story that ends in a bizarre way only to begin thereafter in an unusual way. Joel and Clementine couldn't be more different from one another but I'm a believer that opposites attract and so starts a complicated relationship only to end and start again. It won't be right of me to give away much of the story (I probably have said too much already).The film is poignant as it raises so many questions as it presents complex themes about relationships, heartbreak, whether it's good to have been in a relationship that had its ups and downs than to not have been in that relationship at all, whether erasing the memory of it solves everything. Each theme is handled sensibly. Gondry tells the story in a whimsically lyrical fashion peeling its subtle layers as it develops. To give us company there's the marvelous eclectic soundtrack.I also liked how the editing was done in a very raw choppy fashion which is just how our memories are. We usually jump from one memory to another when we're remembering, thinking, fantasizing, and whatever. That's the feel we get here. The lighting is also dulled down due to the dark theme.Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet deliver remarkable performances, completely different from what they have ever done before. There performances are so natural that it is easy to recognize Joel and Clementine. Carrey and Winslet are solidly supported by Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Jane Adams and David Cross.I couldn't recommend 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' enough. Whether one likes it or not, I can at least say that it will be a different movie experience from what the viewer is acquainted with. For me the title, derived from Alexander Pope's poem, is one of the best movie titles. What a beautiful name of a spellbinding movie!\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a sloppy mess of a movie which dumps sci-fi, romance, camp comedy, and mediocre drama into a Mulligan stew seasoned with intellectual grunge. The film spends most of its run time flashing to and fro between a romantically involved couple's happy days and a sort of lame white out job of their memories of each other. The upside to this flick is its solid cast and remarkable public and critical approval. The downside is it's an ill focused, pathos drenched mess with peripheral nonsense which detracts from the core theme making the \"buy-in\" difficult. Reminiscent of Kaufman's \"Being John Malkovich\" in its lunacy, this film proves once again that creativity is not necessarily a good thing. For Kaufman fans only. (C+)\n",

      "What is it with Charlie Kaufman? He gets these weird little concepts that would work beautifully in a clean, spare, twenty-two minute \"Twilight Zone\" episode, and he insists on milking them and overworking them and pumping them up with pseudo-intellectualism and pseudo-artsy fartsy -isms, to two hour, faux deep messes. Doesn't Charlie Kaufman ever bore himself? I liked \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" much better before I actually saw it. Reviewers praised the movie. The concept was intriguing: brokenhearted couples, fresh out of painful relationships, hire a strip-mall MD -- with a gratuitously Polish name -- Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) -- to erase the painful memories. Who among us has not had that wish? That we could erase the painful past? Now that I've seen it, though, I like the movie a lot less.Kate Winslet as Clementine, a gratingly obnoxious, psycho shrew with yet another gratuitously Polish name ¬ñ Kruczynski -- sort of a blue-orange-haired version of Elizabeth Taylor's Martha in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?\" -- is terrific here. I wish Kate could have given this same masterful performance in a successful movie.Jim Carrey is always good. He's a multi-millionaire dollar box office star who has earned every penny. He conveys, with complete verisimilitude, Joel's vulnerability and social ineptitude.Clementine (Winslet) has borderline personality disorder. That's never stated; one can conclude that from her behavior. Joel (Carrey) has social anxiety disorder, or has no personality. Their relationship, in real life, would probably end up with a sawed-off shotgun, a manslaughter charge, and plea bargaining. Hard to root for this couple. I never cared if they got back together, or did not, or if they forgot each other, or did not. They have exactly two human moments together: when Clementine begs Joel to reassure her that she is pretty, and when Joel is urged, by bullies, to kill a wounded bird. Those two moments should have been in a better movie.Kirsten Dunst has a small part as the vapid, blond, half-naked slut no pretentious movie would be complete without; bug-eyed Elijah Wood irritatingly reminds us how lucky he was to snag the lead in those magical elf movies. Mark Ruffalo is all too believable as an unappealing nerd, who, in spite of a nice body, looks utterly icky dancing in his underwear.If only this film could have been made under the Old Studio system. The execs would have stolen Kaufman's nifty concept. Kaufman would have gone off to become a ruined alcoholic, but audiences would get a moving classic.As it is, we get chopped up images that are not moving, that are not coherent, that don't make you care about anything, and that alienate a vast portion of viewers.Scenes are unnecessarily ugly. Jim Carrey is a naturally handsome man; here he is denied shaving privileges, and apparently he was forbidden from washing his hair. Bad hygiene is Kaufman's trick for communicating that he's made an art movie. For the viewer, it just means that every character looks as if he or she has very bad breath.Will someone please tell Charlie Kaufman: LESS IS MORE. I'm using all caps because this guy is so heavy handed I'm guessing he wouldn't hear anything that isn't shouted.One scene where a character's face is melting is enough. You don't have to revisit that same trick fifteen minutes later and have four characters' faces melting.After the film conveys the cool \"memory erasing\" concept, it wanders aimlessly and repetitively for the next hour and a half or so of chaotic special effects. Houses fall down; characters disappear. There's nothing here that you haven't seen before; in fact, you can experience the essential effect just by looking at the Salvador Dali painting with the melting clock.Apparently a lot of people were confused by this movie. To clarify: 1.) Charlie Kaufman wants you to know that life is about both the bitter and the sweet. Life would be less if we took only the sweet, and deleted the bitter.2.) Charlie Kaufman wants you to know that Charlie Kaufman is a deep guy.3.) Hygiene is overrated; similarly, the lack of hygiene is a sign that this is a prestige film.I'm still confused about this: 1.) What's with the gratuitously Polish names?\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a complex character study of a couple's relationship with an experimental twist. What would happen if turbulent memories of their relationship were erased? How would they react to themselves, each other, and the world around them? The story on paper may represent an interesting scientific research project for some advanced college experimental psychology course. However, in being conveyed to film, ESOTSM doesn't work. The film has more continuity holes than swiss cheese! Time sequences shift all over the place, along with dialog that is disjointed and discombobulated. There are so many scene changes, life changes, and character subplots, that come and go on a whim that you don't know how to follow the movie, and if you do follow the movie, you become confused and utterly lost. What is worse, is that without a road map to follow, or at least SOME beginning, middle, and end to the story, many viewers will not care about this relationship, because there is no reason to do so.The movie would have been better with a firmer placed start, middle, and finish, getting to know the characters, the risks and benefits of the memory experiment, and having the actors relate to the viewers their thoughts and ideas through time periods that are at least somewhat organized or have closure to them. You need a PhD to try to figure out who's coming and going in this movie! By the time you learn about the character(s,) they disappear off the screen. When you see them again (if you even see them again) you're thinking, \"Now, who were they again? What are they doing here?\" The whispering, often drowning out the dialog, makes the plot even more hard to follow. There is far too much happening at once with not enough substance, consistency, or empathy, about the characters to really care about this film.\n",

      "This movie is nothing more than a mind twisting, fairy tale. As in any American movie, it has a very small plot, an uninteresting story that has been made bigger with a tweak of laptops and electronic gadgets. Real life is not like that. Memories are not that limited and you can not play with them. This movie has beautiful imagery, good effects (as in any big budget small story movie), very good cinematography and camera techniques, very good use of light but has an awful script and it is obscure. And it abuses your mind until it comes to where it started. This movie proves one thing, if a relationship had finished once for a reason, it will finish again for the same reason and people will hate each other again.\n",

      "After I looked in the top #250 I decided to rent this movie. I just wanted to see it because the visitors of IMDb voted 8.6 This was a movie I had to see ! I'm sorry to say but is was a very big disappointment. The theme was interesting, but not THAT interesting to look at. Two great actors in strange shots. 50 % of the shots should be erased and filmed again. More picture than story. I don't understand the vote of 8.6 and I'm curious why people are that positive. I read the comments and still doesn't understand. I watch about 2 of 3 movies a week. That doesn't make me a specialist, but I had to make this comment ! And I'm not the only one who doesn't understand. Donnie Darko : great movie. Adaptation : also. But this : I voted 2. Could not make more of it.\n",

      "An interesting but far too complex film, which although full of many good ideas, does not execute them well. The subject matter would best befit a short science fiction story, and indeed the content of the film is so slim that it quite noticeably outstays its welcome. Like most short stories, the film would have best been told from a first person point of view only. The film threads in the story of the operators, just not just the operated too, however. This causes the film to become distracted from the more interesting part of the tale, and as a result, it is at times quite bland. It is not that the viewer does not understand ¬ñ there is just no reason to care. All that said and done, the film certainly has interesting elements, and it will keep one watching for at least three quarters of its duration. It is not really a poor film; it is above average, but I feel it could have been done a lot better.\n",

      "then it became a jumbled, confused, and yes, tortured mess that did not know where to go or how to get there.  The middle part, which was the memory erasure part, was over an hour long and was way too long and boring and convoluted, with terrible and choppy editing, as the story and the director seemed stuck, as in Groundhog Day, and didn't know what to do next to get out of it.  Not well done at all, and it sure tortured me. Groundhog Day was a great film, by the by, and far superior to this flop.More emphasis on the differences and similarities between the two separate relationships of the same two people would have been a great improvement and would have saved the film.  Also, how others interacted with them in the two relationships, and how the two leads related to these people would have worked well too.  The film became so unworldly and screwball that it lost its humanity and love until a conventional  formula Hollywood ending \"saved\" it(for the box office).Also, why did the filmmaker think that sloppy and careless Gen-Xer slackers with bad hair, hygiene, clothes, and personal behavior would be the best ones to do the critical memory erasing jobs???  Absolutely no credibilty there, and surely was done because the filmmaker is obviously \"one of them\"'. I say, Booshwah to that.Spend your money somewhere else, you'll be glad you did. This film is going nowhere and will be another failure for Carrey.\n",

      "This movie was labelled a comedy, but there was hardly anything in it that made me even smile, let alone laugh. The plot might have some potential if the movie were done differently, but the character of Clementine is so devoid of any attractive qualities or redeeming virtues that I kept hoping What's-His-Name would come to his senses and realize what a blessing it was that she decided to end the relationship. There was nobody in this movie to like or admire. It was simply tedious. I kept hoping it would improve but it didn't so I turned it off after about an hour. This was disappointing, since Jim Carrie is usually worth watching, as is Kate Winslet--but not this time.\n",

      "This movie, just like the movie 'Stalker' has amazed me, not because of the movie, but because of the rave reviews it's been given.Seriously, I found it utterly boring on just about every level.This movie could have had some real humor mixed in here, but sadly it just comes across as a very depressing and unmoving love story.The idea is that there's a machine which can completely erase your memories(well most of them). Through this process, 2 people discover what they are actually missing out on a lot of good memories that get wiped with the bad ones.Essentially we are the sum of our experiences. Take some of those memories away and we find ourselves feeling like there's something missing.It's sci-fi because of the machine, however in real life, there are people who loose parts of there memory and try to piece things together to plug the hole. This is really no different.There was the potential to have a love story comedy with ground hog day like connotations that would have been truly amusing. Instead we just learn about 2 rather messed up people to begin with, who look destined to repeat the same mistakes but who can tell the future? Even Stalker was better than this film and I found myself wondering which film was the most boring.If your not into tedious unmoving drama stories then avoid this movie at all costs.\n",

The story was implausible - I have had dreams that make more sense. Meddling up with the story line does not equal originality, in my opinion. Something much more is needed, and this movie lacked in it.In sum, absolutely not worth your time: neither original, not fun (I expected the latter, frankly).Apparently, a streak of bad luck for me these days, as this is the second movie I watch that received a high rating on IMDb but was complete trash (and not in a good way).\n",

None of the characters are at all likable and a majority of the scenes are terribly cringe-worthy. The film is scattered with no plot line. The entire thing is basically watching Joel's memories of Clementine as he's having them erased, and none of them are interesting to watch whatsoever.

Plus the fact that weird images are randomly thrown in there with random shots and cuts and weirdness for the sake of weirdness. And that goes on and on and on.

People said how smart and brilliant the story was, how beautiful the romance was and how nice the couple were. I found the characters realistic, I liked the guy and liked that nice girl with colorful hair style like her philosophy about life and I like the whole idea behind them. However, I just didn't find their story touching, heartbreaking or miraculous, so I was not that impressed. Are the technical aspects of the film such as editing etc. fascinating? Well, I don't think it is, but the film is pretty inventive and good surrealism overall, however, the film itself is little cold and there is a barrier between the characters and the audience. I couldn't feel the film. I cannot say style over substance problem, but something else was missing in the film. The supporting characters were not interesting, rather tedious. I will be honest, I don't know why, but I enjoyed The Science of Sleep more and thought it was a better film than \"Spotless Mind\". It delivers for me, but for this film, I appreciate the film for its inventive story, cinematography and cool love story with realism and the chemistry between Carrey and Winslett were perfect indeed, but I don't think it is a great story or an unforgettable experience. I believe that the story was supposed to be touching, but it suffers from style over substance issue.

I didn't at any point feel that Winslet and Carrey were in love with each other which is kinda an important ingredient for this film to workI never really liked Winslet much to be honest, I find her very self absorbed and self indulgent and she never really appears to give anything on screen to her co actors. Jim Carrey is okay but feels shallow in this one. overall him and Winslet just do not feel like a good match at all. probably Carrey and Dunst would've been a more interesting couplein terms of production values I saw or heard nothing exceptional. visually and sonically I found the movie very grey\n",

That would sum up this infinitely overrated movie from someone who clearly should stick to putting his ideas out in 3 minutes as opposed to 123.Jim Carrey is a boring pathetic loser who meets \"vibrant\" (her hair colour sounds like some type of condom) Kate Winslet on a train. They talk about stuff I couldn't honestly care about for a while. Then one day Jim Carrey finds out that she had her memory of him erased, so being the spiteful dweeb prone to peer pressure, he follows suit. What follows, is some of the most boring, decently edited, repetitive scenes to be praised to high heaven. Why on Earth would Jim Carrey want to hold on to his \"precious\" memories of her? She's clearly a bitch. There's also a rather weak subplot about people who work at the memory-erasing place, taking advantage of people after their operation. (Could it be a stab at governmental power abuse? Young people love to rebel against \"The Man\", so we must appeal to them). In the end, it turns out that when they first met on the train at the start of the film, that was AFTER their operation (which anyone with two brain cells could have guessed right at the start). Because we all know, films that start at the end are incredibly complex to figure out.The good points? The acting is OK, and some of the editing is nice, and it's OK to look at. But apart from that, this is an absolutely awful excuse of film-making. It has truly ignorant characters, it goes absolutely nowhere for 2 hours straight and gives you absolutely nothing profound or interesting to take from it. All it does is appeal to pseudo-intellectual's who have been spurned in relationships (because they are pseudo-intellectual losers who don't deserve to be in love), because let's face it, who hasn't been hurt in a relationship? Exactly, and because Michel Gondry is French, and apparently French films incorporate every single foreign language film, it can be classified as a French film, and is therefore cool (because you must have one french film in your list of favourite films, most people have that other overrated pile of garbage \"Amelie\" in there, but this can suffice).Overall, an absolute waste of time, you want to watch a real film about grown ups in love? \"In The Mood For Love\" and \"2046\".

This might be an emotional idea, but the realization is very cold. Somehow I do not feel any strong emotion throughout the movie.All the time I was hoping and waiting for some kind of spectacular ending which will blow me off, like The Truman Show for example, but nothing special happened. Yes, they did meet again, so what? The atmosphere is similar to \"Lost In Translation\", which is another movie who I think is overrated.

I looked forward to a humorous yet thoughtful consideration of a fascinating question: If you could ease the pain of a breakup by eliminating all memory of the beloved, would you? And if you did, would it be good for you emotionally?Man, what a disappointment. The first problem was Clementine, one of the most repellent female characters I've ever seen on screen. Narcissistic, hostile, whiny, self-centered, ignorant, humorless, cruel -- who could spend 10 minutes with such a woman, let alone fall in love with her? Yet this movie asks us to believe that two men find her irresistible. Huh?Then there's the disjointed plotting. I suppose the film is supposed to evoke the dream state. Clearly, though, viewers have a lot of trouble figuring out basic chronology, not to mention how things remain between the lovers at the end. I personally felt as if the director were screaming: \"Look at me! Look at me! See how clever and original I am?\" Kind of like Clementine, as a matter of fact. The title is superb, and I enjoyed hearing the bimbo Mary mangle Alexander Pope's name while reciting it. But the movie is thoroughly unworthy of that lovely line.\n",

Clever movie this is claimed to be, what is so clever about this drivel. the only nice thing is how the initial phases of the movie prove to be shifted parts later. the way the operation was performed on him and the 2 guys and the girl was so irritating. no one on earth would imagine tinkering around with the brain under such circumstances.and damn it, the guy happens to be technician, not even a doc.plot wise, the movie again sucks, no depth by any standards, so they fell in love, then break up shown in mixed phases. she erases him from her mind, he proceeds to do the same and in his mind she helps him open his eye and yes, there he is jim carey opening his eye when the operation is being performed. crap crap and crap just avoid this\n",

      "Have you ever wondered what it feels like to forget everything? It seems like it would be weird, not remember what you know. Like a favorite movie that you bought and watched over and over again. What if all that was gone when you woke up? What if someone has you erased from their mind completely without you being aware? In Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jim Carey plays Joel Barish, an average Joe trying to survive. When Joel finds out that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him and all the times they spent together erased completely from her mind by a doctor who specializes in the field, Joel gets very upset and has the exact same thing done to her. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his three employees, Mary, Stan, and Patrick (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood) go to work on Joel's memories. Howard is the man in charge, Mary is the secretary, Stan is Howard's assistant, and Patrick is sort of Stan's assistant and gets himself into quite the pickle when he decides to date Clementine using Joel's memories as a guide to her. Now the process of erasing Clementine begins.Once inside Joel's memories we discover how this whole mind erasing duel started. Joel went to see Clementine at work and she didn't recognize him whatsoever, but she certainly was familiar with the boy at the store, whom she kisses, and remains anonymous. The thing with memories is it is hard to see things from a different point of view. The mood is the same, the emotions are the same, and the situation is the same. When Joel realizes that he doesn't want to forget her, he tries to hide her in different memories. Anything from childhood to random embarrassing memories. Stan and Mary don't know what to do...except smoke pot and fool around in Joel's apartment. When they lose Joel in Joel's mind, meaning that Joel has hidden Clementine in a different memory and his subconscious is doing the hiding, they call Howard over to take a look. What follows is a cat and mouse game in Joel's head all the while realizes what a great person Clementine is and how he wishes he con't forget her.Michel Gondry's vision is one that boggles the mind. This is one of the most original ideas made into a film in a long, long time. Along with the help of writer Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), this story of how love can exist between two people on opposite ends of the spectrum harmoniously. Carey is great as the subtle yet obnoxious Joel and gives the character a great boost of comedy. Winslet received an Oscar-nomination for Best Actress for her portrayal of Clementine, the exuberant, spunky woman of Joel's dreams. She makes him feel excited and adventurous and just plain good. Her performance is stellar.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an instant classic. It's a league all on it's own. It has comedy, drama, romance, and a science fiction background. Gondry delivers the goods with this movie and I anticipate his future releases. Eternal Sunshine is a must own movie that any collector would be sad to miss out on. You can watch it 30 times and still find something new to appreciate every time. It will blow your mind...\n",

      "This movie without any doubt deserves to be on the top 250 list. Although I had to watch the movie about 4 times to fully understand it, I was surprised beyond all reason to discover that in fact this movie isn't random after all. Once you understand everything, you'll realize that EVERYTHING fits together like a puzzle. One piece can't stand alone without another. I especially loved the casting. This is an unusual but fitting part for Jim Carrey, since it is not a flat-out comedy like most of his other films. It's also an excellent role for Kate Winslet- her diversity as an actress in outstanding. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is good at unraveling intellectual plots or if you aren't, just like being confused.\n",

      "To be accurate I have seen this movie in entirety twice, but parts of it over and over.... many of these scenes have been noted as favorites etc...including the doll scene \"intimacy revealed\"...the Meet me in Mantauk scene..\"profound understanding\" (if you concede that Clementine must have experienced a similar 'calling' in her erasure experience...I found this sentence profoundly revealing.Also the Alexander Pope quotation stated by Mary, not realizing that she is what she is speaking the \"Vestle / Vessel\" untainted by the real world but living in ignorance. The vessel is revealed to be the self-judger.I watched this with a friend of mine who was experiencing post bad-break up trauma. It is shocking to realize that the person that you hate, can also be the person most responsible for a lasting change in perspective.The erasure for me was like experiencing a death. The doctor stated that once the original memory is erased the additional memories will fade after. Maybe this is the meaning of the final ride home with Joel's friends, when he says \"She was just some girl\". I cried because this is not merely an extermination of memories but an extermination of self. The ultimate cutting off your nose to spite your face.Of course I can understand why some found it difficult. It requires some revisiting but the effort is worthwhile if you are interested. I still found myself unclear in particular when J. appears to visit C. at work stocking shelves. He speaks as if they are real but they clearly are not since he talks of a second go at the relationship. I am assuming that the start of the scene is immediately after the initial meeting at the beach house (when Joel ran away).Sometimes, of course, to understand you must experience and if there are any of you who knew someone was bad for you but you still went back again because of some intangible attraction you will know what I mean.I more than loved this movie, I left this movie thinking differently about my life. I thought to myself if I had to guess where someone I loved was right at this moment would I be able to be correct with any certainty? Okay I am a romantic at heart so you will want to temper this endorsement with some reality. If you don't get it then you haven't been swept away by unknown forces.Cheers\n",

      "This movie was fantastic on so many different levels. I have often wished upon the stars to have my mind wiped clean of bad relationships, tears, break-ups and losses. Yet after watching this I realize that all those events helped to create the person I am today (for better or worse...)...this movie is about celebrating the nuances of togetherness, the trials and the victories...Kate Winslet is enthralling as Clementine, who reminds me of every cool, kooky, sincere girl I ever knew. The Jim Carrey character is a sweet guy; not an ounce of malice there-- but his fatal flaw lies in his fear of accepting all that Clementine is (he only wanted to be with one dimension of her being). I felt horrible for the Kirsten Dunst girl; she was a pawn in the Doctor's game. She was the standout 'victim' in the movie. Elijah Wood's character was eerie...kinda stalkerish...I love the editing; the amazing cuts from scene to scene. The shots out on Long Island were great.All in all, this movie made me cry and think and drive down to the coast to think about old loves-- long erased-- to the passing of time.\n",

      "I won't give away any spoilers. All I will say is that I never got around to seeing this film in the theatres, and I wondered why this film was voted \"Best Film\" by IMDb users. Now I know. This film fully deserved to win Best Original Screenplay, and it's a crying shame it did not get more nominations, particularly for Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet (her best work since \"Titanic\") As much as I loved \"Titanic\"---and I still believe that film deserved to win Best Picture---this film is grounded in a reality that cuts deeper to the bone. It's one thing to recreate the sinking of an ocean liner in exquisite detail, but it's another to recreate the joys, sorrows, and pain that love brings out. In hindsight the debate over whether \"Titanic\" or \"L.A. Confidential\" seems rather silly. This film is better than both.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman has done two movies now that take personality bending to a new level. In Adaptation, he wrote himself and his imaginary twin brother into a story about white orchids, and here in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kaufman plays \"what if\" with two people who are really in love but only remember the bad times and decide to have each other erased from their memories. This is a movie the viewer needs to see more than once, probably more than twice, to comfortably experience the film. Kaufman and director Michel Gondry plays with the time line of the film, and on first viewing, it's sometimes difficult to separate what is happening now and what has already happened. Seeing the film a second time will help the viewer understand the story, but the emotional feelings remain the same. The great revelation of film is that two people have a relationship for a reason, and unfortunately, we only remember the bad times, and forget the good times. For the characters in Eternal Sunshine, this revelation comes way too late for them, and there is a sense of desperation as they try to hang on to the memories they have. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish who is a quiet, laid back guy who meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), a wild child who's spontaneity scares, yet intrigues, Joel. Carrey once again shows that he's not just a comedic actor, but rather a serious all-around actor. He immerses himself into the character Joel, making us forget this is the same guy who was the Cable Guy. Winslet received an Oscar nomination for her job as Clematine, and it's deserved. She relays Joel's desperation in the last third of the movie, heightening the emotional roller coaster this movie takes us on. After one fight too many, each seeks out Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) who is able to remove the memories of anyone from a person's brain. Joel's procedure is lead by Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood), but turns out to be difficult case. This leads to a subplot involving Dr. Howard and his secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst) that ultimately leads to a crushing final act to the film. It's a powerful and appropriate finale, where the characters understand where they stand, and their decision makes total sense. Kaufman and Gondry won an Oscar for this original screenplay, featuring a story that is science fiction, and like most great works of science fiction, is not really about the science, but rather the results of technology. Eternal Sunshine is a movie where there is much more than what appears on the screen; each viewer can put themselves into the film, identify with the situations they recall, and perhaps leading the viewer to remember those good times that we each take for granted.\n",

      "This is by far my favorite movie. It may be a little confusing the first time you see it, but if you're able to see it again, you'll start to understand it's true value. It's not another dull romance film, and it definitely isn't a waste of time. It is about a man named Joel (carrey) who just broke up with his girlfriend, Clementine(Winston), and then tries to make it up to her, but realizes that she has erased him from her mind. This is where it gets a little confusing...So now Joel decides to get the operation done on him to erase Clementine. During the surgery he has passed out and in his subconscious he wants to end it. now Joel and his memories of Clementine are trying to run away from the mind-washers.

Perhaps because it had no flow. I was trying to understand the premise on erasing his mind but even after that the movie just seems to go nowhere. The hardest thing was that it appears he didn't have any reason for going through this big mind-erase thing. They never really give you a reason to see why he wants to go through this process. Perhaps a third attempt is warranted...NOT!\n",

      "Forget about \"Collateral\" when you are talking about the best movie of 2004. Everybody who thinks \"Collateral\" should have won the Oscars for best movie and best performance, really doesn't know what he's saying... \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is by far the best movie I've seen that year. That doesn't mean that Collateral isn't a good movie, because it is and yes I liked it, but it never was as great as this one.It's some kind of love story, but it's completely refreshing and hasn't used any of the standard clich√©s you'll see so often in romantic Hollywood movies. It's sober, it's emotional, it's happy and sad together, it's captivating, ... , it's just indescribable! I liked \"Being John Malkovich\", but \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is even a lot better. There are some similarities between the two: both movies show us the thoughts of someone else, like if we are experiencing them ourselves. But \"Being John Malkovich\", is completely crazy, while \"ESOFSM\" offers a more realistic view on the subject.Jim Carrey's character is just an ordinary guy, so hurt by the one he loves that he tries whatever is possible to erase her from his mind. His girlfriend has already had her mind erased by a company and now doesn't know anything about him anymore. He decides to do the same, but as he goes on with the procedure he realizes that, even though his relationship with her wasn't always great, he just doesn't want to erase her from his mind. The fact that we all know the feelings he is going through is probably the main reason why we all like this movie so much. Also the message that when you erase your mind, history is likely to repeat itself, really ads an extra touch to the movie.If you ask me this movie should have won all Oscars, but I'm not a member of the jury of course. The acting was great, Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey were absolutely astonishing. The concept was refreshing and original. The movie had really everything to offer that I want: a laugh and a tear, a good message and a great feeling afterward, even though the ending was perhaps a little bit too slow. Too often I see bad movies, but once in a while you'll find a gem between all the ugly rocks. This is 2004's gem. I give it a 10/10.\n",

      "While I enjoyed this movie very much at first, in the end it was a bit disappointing. Like in a detective novel, the plot is hugely important in this film. And while the acting and camera-work are really outstanding IMHO, the plot just isn't up to par; when 2/3's of the movie was over the plot was completely clear to me and the final 1/3 of the movie played out exactly as I figured it would. In my opinion the producers of this film underestimated the intelligence of their audience, thereby making this film less interesting than it could have been.

It is such a brilliant film, the cinematography is beautiful and i just could not get enough of it. I loved in the movie how it was such a dream i mean things would just disappear in the shot, and it was nice to see Jim Carry in a somewhat normal role being a calmer man compared to his Lemony Snicket performance where he was just bouncing off the walls.

Its originality was beautiful, its realness was beautiful and its love story was beautiful. OK now for my question... One thing i'm confused on is well i know that all the stuff at the beginning up until Elija's character comes to the door of the movie was what happened after their memories were erased and that stuff that happened on the ice with them two.. that was after their memories had been erased right?

      "A lovely story which must of been a hard feat to get it on film. If we could open up more to these type of movies it would help us evolve and understand ourselves.Like trying a new infusion it tastes odd to our senses, to be bombarded with various dimensions at once. Once we get more accustomed to stories that ask for our own awareness to be invested in to them, we can take a leap with our own lives and choose rather than just re-act as always.Many thanks to all of those who believed in this project.My only criticism for this film is the music, much more could have been done with moods with the assistance of the right background music.It has a very similar theme to \"Being John Malkovithch! This film delivers a strong message of the dangerous areas the individual mind can take us. \"Everybody's got to learn sometime\" as the final tune sings \"change your heart\"best wishes Craig\n",

      "wonderful, profound and imaginative, are the best words I can think of to describe this film. To the mesmerising soundtrack, to the highly acclaimed performances from both Kate Winslet and Jim Carey, this is definitely a film that tugs on the heart strings and makes you take a good look at your own life. It was most interesting to see a role reversal of the two actors, this time Kate winslet taking on the role of the impulsive and extrovert character of Clementine, when we are so used to seeing her as the English rose bound in corset dramas. and likewise with Jim Carey who undertakes the character of Joel and proves himself that he can perform out of the comic, zany characters he usually portrays and pulls it off extremely well. Although I have nothing but praise for the co stars of this movie; Kristan Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood it was really Carey's and winslet's film and centres around them most of the time. The concept is original and clever and proves the talents of little known director Michel Gondry making the whole watching process fun and incredibly engaging especially the editing, going from one scene to another is surely a work of genius and although confusing at the beginning of the film it rounds up together nicely at the end. If there was one criticism to make (if any) that would have to be why was it Jim Carey's performance went so disappointingly unnoticed, which should of least earned him a nomination for a award much like fellow actress Kate Winslet. His portrayal of Joel is what I felt gave the film a lot of heart especially during the more emotional moments of the film that when re-realizes his love for Clementine he trys everything in his power to stunt his procedure, watching that kind of desperation and determination from a actor made it very believable to watch. Overall it should appeal to almost anyone especially fans of weird and wacky art-house movies, so whatever you do don't forget to see this.\n",

      "It's not often a movie comes a long that is so good it makes you completely forget that the entire premise of the film is utterly impossible. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those movies. Jim Carrey stars as Joel Barish, a fumbling, socially incompetent man who learns that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him erased from her memory.In an attempt to even the score and to settle his own demons, Joel undergoes the same procedure to erase memories of Clementine from his head. Director Michel Gondry takes us backward through Joel's mind as each individual memory is erased. What follows is an extraordinary lesson about love, loss and the value of our memories.In Eternal Sunshine, Carrey gives the most inspired performance of his career. While he has turned in standout performances in Man on the Moon and The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine shows his full range as a dramatic actor. Kate Winslet sheds her familiar British accent and fully transforms herself in playing the complex role of Clementine, a needy alcoholic who always seems to get bored with her men.The movie's non-linear style is a clever way to tell the story. It's not always evident where the characters are in time. Subtle details, such as the color of Clementine's hair in a particular scene, are used to identify the point in time to the viewer.The casting in Eternal Sunshine served as one of its strongest suits. Carrey and Winslet are joined by youngsters Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood as assistants for Lacuna Incorporated, the company erasing Joel's memory. All four characters have their own sense of immaturity, but the balance between the subtle immaturity of Carrey and Winslet's characters and the blatant, expressive immaturity of Dunst and Wood's characters adds another layer of context to a very deep, emotional film.On February 27, Charlie Kaufman was honored with an Oscar for best original screenplay for Eternal Sunshine. After seeing him lose for several phenomenal films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, it was nice to see a brave and original writer finally get his due. Without a doubt, Eternal Sunshine is clearly Kaufman's most ambitious project to date.\n",

      "One of the strangest cinematic experiences I have ever had. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" deals with mind erasing, manipulation and the belief that love can indeed conquer all in the end---or can it? Co-writer Charlie Kaufman's (who has already puzzled me with \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation.\") thoughts obviously go into hyper-overdrive here from the word go. Lonely man Jim Carrey meets the eccentric and multi-hair-colored Kate Winslet and a romance blossoms, but nothing is quite as it seems. Winslet has apparently gone to a clinic where her memories of Carrey have been erased forever. Thus she acts like she does not know him anymore. Carrey decides to get even by having the same procedure done to erase Winslet from his mind. He goes to see a specialist (Tom Wilkinson) and is soon going through the procedure at the home of one of Wilkinson's employees (Mark Ruffalo). Also with Ruffalo is co-worker Elijah Wood (who has developed feelings for Winslet) and hospital secretary Kirsten Dunst. Dunst has secrets aplenty herself as she is secretly dating Ruffalo and has an unclear relationship with Wilkinson. These are really side-stories though as Carrey goes on a harrowing journey while unconscious during the procedure to salvage what he believes he and Winslet once had. Shades of \"Vertigo\" here as we see one of those love stories that is really too complicated and confusing for celluloid. The journey into the human mind and the emotions associated with true love are aspects that come through in very unorthodox and down-right confusing fashions. To be honest I do not understand everything about this film, but it still struck nerves deep in me. I felt numb by the whole production as the drama goes to the outer limits and the comedy feels forced and somewhat out of place. Innovative and creative, but landmark and impressive? Not completely sold on those last two. 4 stars out of 5.\n",

The movie is not told in linear time, which makes it interesting, although a bit confusing if you don't freeze the tape or pause the DVD if you have to leave the room for a bit. The film made me think a lot about memories, and their powers, and it touched me very deeply. Kudos as well to Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst for their performances.\n",

Maybe it is enough but not for me at the time after I finished the movie. All brainwashing and possibility to change your memories makes me feel bored - just as I have already written down. One thing is perhaps complicated script but I cant see nothing behind it - it just looked like a film and not like the story which can happen.(I know it looks a little weird from me but that is what I felt about it). I may just not be tuned on the wave of the film makers as well - so it could be my personal exception - or did you have the same feeling? Nevermind. So in the end :After seeing this movie I feel absolutely nothing and didn't even have any need to think about something and it is very rare about films I usually choose.\n",

I don't mind a serious movie that makes the audience feel some emotion.The direction in this movie is outstanding. There have been many cinematic attempts to create a surreal environment for the viewer. They usually come off like those awful LSD \"trippy\" movies from the 1970's. This one got it right. It was clear when Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) was experiencing the progressive memory loss and how surreal that was to him. There is a LOT of interesting things going on in the background of many of the scenes in this movie. It is done without upstaging the events in the foreground, too. Truly outstanding work my Michael Gondry.The acting was well-done, too. Jim Carrey turns in a remarkably depressing performance. Kate Winslet also plays her character extremely well. It is very, very believable even though the subject matter requires the suspension of disbelief.This is my kind of movie. It is character-driven with a deep and innovative plot. The cinematic qualities of the movie are exceptional. What confused me the most was that I didn't like it much.It took me until the next day to realize why the movie left me cold. I didn't like any of the characters. The Jim Carrey character is depressed, lonely and rather pitiful. The Kate Winslet character was a loony. She must have had bipolar disorder or something, because she was not stable. The supporting characters were ethics-free. There was no one in this movie that I cared about. It's a shame, too, because so much is right with this movie.I gave it a 6/10.\n",

Carrey has thrown off his cute clown mask for good (I wasn't totally convinced after \"The Truman show\"¬Ö",
      ") and is fully matched by the rest of its spirited cast ('Frodo' in a crew-cut... right on!).A sparkling intellectual feast that races and challenges, keeps its audience guessing and puzzled, yet never outruns or outsmarts you, while embracing you in a warm bear hug.

      "Generally, romantic comedies fall into two types. Most celebrate the fantasy of love: the notions of destiny and soul-mates, where love comes between witty exchanges and longing looks set to music. This isn't necessarily a bad thing--in fact, some of these films are rather entertaining--but as everyone knows, love isn't like it is in the movies. It's complicated, messy, difficult, and sometimes doesn't work out no matter how hard you try. Which brings us to the second, rarer type of romantic comedy--the kind that celebrates the reality of love, in all its wonderful, awful glory. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a film in this category.The story begins on Valentines Day, with sad sack Joel (Jim Carrey) ditching his normal routine on an impulse and taking a train to Montauk, where he meets a cotton candy-haired free spirit named Clementine (Kate Winslet). They are drawn to each other in what seems like their first meeting, but as things progress we realize we've come in at the middle. For Joel and Clementine dated over the course of two years before things went sour. After a bad breakup, Joel learned that Clementine had her memories of him removed by a clandestine neurosurgeon (Tom Wilkinson) and his staff. In a fit of anger, Joel decides that he too wants Clementine \"lost and gone forever.\" This is where the movie really takes off, as we enter Joel's mind and are taken backwards through his relationship with Clementine, the memories vanishing as Joel relives them. Michael Gondry and Charlie Kaufmann come up with an effective method of communicating the inner workings of Joel's mind on screen. Events follow the sort of bizarre logic that we find in dreams, overlapping and reflecting on each other, while Joel experiences them with the benefit of hindsight. Then the memories start to fade: first the details, then the important parts, until everything just crumbles, or is ripped away, or simply fades into nothing. When Joel decides he doesn't want to lose Clementine, he attempts to secret her away in memories from his childhood, leading to one of the film's best scenarios as the adult Carrey embodies Joel's three-year-old self.Jim Carrey is a hit-or-miss actor for me, but I've always admired him for his willingness to explore roles beyond the hyperactive wild men who have been so lucrative for him in the past. He does good work as Joel, a man so weighed down with his own disappointments he almost seems not to exist at times. Winslet continues to prove herself one of the best actresses of her generation, making Clementine complex, difficult, and strangely likable. Strong supporting performances come in from Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst as Wilkinson's support staff, who are just as lost in the romantic game as Joel and Clementine are. Wood's creepy yet pathetic Patrick tries to romance Winslet using the remains of her relationship with Joel. Ruffalo and Dunst have a thing going, but the deep admiration she harbors for the boss becomes more pronounced as the film wears on.Eventually, we end up back where we started, as Joel and Clementine meet again for the first time. Kaufmann wisely avoids any sentiments of destiny in the film's concluding moments¬óindeed, it is arguable that the couple could be headed for heartbreak all over again. But then, there is a lot of truth in that saying of loving and losing.\n",

      "This is one of the most inspirational movies I have ever seen. When I went to go see it with my boyfriend, we found that we could relate to Kate Winslet and Jim Carey's characters in many ways. Aside from the inspirational side of the movie, I was extremely impressed with its artistic side. I enjoy movies that encourage viewers to think about what is going on. On the way home from the movie theatre, I had to think about the movie and its structure for a few minutes before I could piece it together. This movie was a masterpiece. Love story?....Yes! However, it's not the typical love story. It really touches a deeper place of the heart, and although erasing the human memory is not a very realistic thing to do in today's society, the message the story conveys is very real! When the movie was out in theaters, most of the theaters in my area were not playing it, but after seeing the movie preview for the first time, I had to find a place to see the movie. When I found it at Lake theater, in Oak Park, I was quite excited to view it. Now, I own the movie in my collection, and it still remains one of my top favorites of all time.\n",

      "As a big fan of Charlie Kaufman's previous work (especially \"Adaptation\" and the badly underrated, absolutely hilarious \"Human Nature\"), i had very high expectations for this film. Unfortunately, i must say that i was very disappointed. As i sat in the theater, i desperately tried to enjoy it, but i found that i just couldn't. For one thing, it really wasn't very funny. Also, i found it unnecessarily confusing (which i feel may have been deliberate, but ultimately not beneficial to the film). Above all, though, i just couldn't bring myself to empathize with the lead characters. What can i say? I just don't like Jim Carrey or Kate Winslet. To me, Jim Carrey has yet to convincingly play a serious role, and i've honestly never liked Kate Winslet in anything she's been in. Also, i thought the two of them lacked convincing chemistry together. But overall, i just feel like the film was probably just too abstract and high-concept an idea for anyone (even Kaufman, the king of high-concept) to be able to pull off well.\n",

      "Come on people, this is NOT THAT GOOD A MOVIE!! Is it clever, yes. Unique, sure. Whimsical, OK. But how about poorly directed, badly cast, horribly acted, and edited by an ADD sufferer.The storyline and cinematic treatment are engaging -- for the first 20 minutes. But this film, like Kaufman's predecessors Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, suffers from the cardinal sin of BEING TOO IMPRESSED WITH ITSELF. This is more a movie about making a super-clever concept movie than it is about an actual story and actual characters that you can really care about. By hitting the viewer over the head with the gimmickry, it becomes insulting, tiring and just not interesting anymore.For a far better thought-provoking concept film, try Carrey's Truman Show.\n",

      "These comments are mainly directed to those who have seen the movie. If you haven't seen it, by all means do. My tag line is a little misleading, because in some ways the movie does work. By co-incidence I've recently viewed both this movie and \"The Matrix\" for the first time. Both movies use the technique of 'mediated reality', where the main characters lie prone for much of the movie while they are 'fed' a version of reality: a virtual reality in the case of The Matrix, or a dream sequence in the case of this movie. The problem with the use of this technique is that the reality space of the movie risks becoming non-contiguous with that of the viewer - viewers may not be able to relate to what they are seeing. The technique does allow the director a great deal of latitude in the turns the movie will take, and one tends to feel off-balance because everything is so unpredictable. In the case of The Matrix, I became annoyed with the way in which 'Neo's superpowers were simply escalated to get him out of any given situation. (Good eye-candy though). While 'Sunshine' is a much more intellectually interesting movie than The Matrix, I'm still left a little cold. Does this movie relate to anything in my life, or offer any relevant insight into our experience in general? Relevance to our experiecne is not precluded by the use of 'mediated reality' as a technique. The Truman Show, for example, is very relevant to our post-modern experience. But this movie doesn't say much to me, beyond trying to be very clever. Perhaps whatever message is there, needed to be made more explicit. (Or perhaps I'm too old or too thick, take your pick). The final section of the movie, where the leads resume their love affair, offered possibilities, but ended too soon. Finally, I found the characters themselves to be fairly tawdry and somewhat sleazy, which distanced the movie even further - in my view.\n",

      "Self indulgent. If the story were portrayed in chronological order it would be deemed trite. Neither of the principal characters is particularly appetizing; they lack depth and developed characters other than superficial traits.The secondary characters other than serving the need of explaining the memory erasure do not drive the narrative and serve mainly as filler.Kaufman uses film as a form of freudian analysis instead of seeing a psychiatrist. He might write better screenplays after having been analyzed.On the other hand he might quit screen writing altogether if he completed analysis.\n",

I did however wish I could erase the memory of everyone I've ever been in love with.I recently finished watching the extras on the DVD and while they were informative they did nothing to enhance my enjoyment of the movie but I thought the music video was really good.So, I wasn't bored but I was captivated either.\n",

      "Jim Carrey's first two serious movies were 'The Truman Show' and 'The Majestic'. Now, he has made a third, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', the title apparently taken from a quote from Alexander Pope, spoken by the Kirsten Dunst character. I like this movie and also liked 'Being John Malkovich'. Both of them require the viewer to accept that we are able to visualize what is going on inside someone's mind. If you can't accept that premise, then the movie is not for you. Carrey is good as Joel Barish, but Kate Winslet is even better as his kookie American romantic interest, Clementine Kruczynski. Tom Wilkinson plays Dr. Howard Mierzwiak who has developed the medical technique featured in the movie. But before you watch this movie, take out your map and locate Montauk, which is the most eastern community on Long Island, NY. SPOILERS FOLLOW, quit reading if you have not yet seen the movie. Seriously!!The first scene in the movie is also the last scene. We see Joel mysteriously running from his normal work-bound platform to take the train to Montauk, and he isn't certain why. He walks the beach, talks to himself, is shy, but sees Clementine there. They ride the same train back, she is gregarious and initiates conversation. This is their second time to 'discover' each other, but neither realizes that. In between the movie's beginning and end, we see them getting closer together, only to have issues appear, and she impulsively takes a new treatment where the doctor and his staff 'map' the brain activity of what a person wants to forget, then erases all those specific memories overnight with a contraption on the patient's head. She forgets Joel. Hurt, Joel does the same, but during his procedure has second thoughts, realizes he doesn't really want to forget her, unable to wake up he tries to hide his memories of her in places not mapped by the doctor. We view all this going on in his mind. As a last resort he whispers 'Montauk', and both of them end up there, re-discover each other, and we see them trying again. Point being, if you were attracted to each other before, even though your memories are gone, you will be attracted again.\n",

      "Would someone please erase all memories of Michel Gondry's existence from Charlie Kaufman's mind? This is the second time that Gondry ruins one of Kaufman's scripts. Let there not be a third time.\"The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" has an extremely interesting premise and a cast full of talented actors. The right director could easily have made this into a film that rivals \"Being John Malcovich\" or \"Adaptation\". Gondry, on the other hand, has made it into a pile redundant, self-indulgent nonsense. The bulk of the film consists of endless and absolutely pointless visual trickery that only confuses, bores and alienates the viewer. About halfway through the film, I was trying to decide whether to walk out or to wait for something to start actually happening. I'm not sorry I stuck it out, because things do wrap up in the end and it all ends in a relatively positive note, but all in all that doesn't make up for the fact that the entire previous hour of the film has been wasted. I also hate the way this movie looks -- drab, dark and unnecessarily ugly. I understand that these people lead uninteresting and pedestrian lives, OK? There's no need to shove it down my throat. BTW, this film has no actual nudity, but being directed by a Frenchman, it does have some T&A -- possibly to keep male viewers from falling asleep. Kate Winslett takes care of the \"T\" department while Kirsten Dunst is on the \"A\" case.\n",

      "One of the things that has really surprised me about the movies that are coming out at the time of this writing is which ones are turning out to be good and which ones are turning out to be not so great. I haven't seen all of them yet, but it's pretty odd to me that the latest movie starring Jim Carrey - an actor who not long ago seemed doomed to never rise above rubber-faced, low-brow slapstick comedy - is one of the best movies in theaters, and if that weren't enough, the latest remake of a classic horror film, Dawn of the Dead, is getting better reviews than the newest Tom Hanks movie. Luckily, the 2004 Dawn of the Dead is spectacular, so getting better reviews than The Ladykillers doesn't speak badly of Tom Hanks' latest effort.In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Carrey once again raises the bar of his own performance. This is probably the most evolved actor working today, having gone from the late-night television crap of In Living Color (bad) to Ace Ventura (goofy but funny) to The Cable Guy (which fell flat because the script was dumb, and Carrey's iconography was just not ready for such a dramatic character) to The Truman Show (good) to Man on the Moon (very good) to The Majestic (VERY good) to Bruce Almighty (goofy but also very good) and finally to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, arguably the most in depth and developed character he has ever played and by far his greatest film so far.Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a man with difficulty not only in his relationships, but also in his overall interaction with other people. He lives such a lonely life that, by his own admission, he has a tendency to fall in love with any woman who shows him even the slightest bit of attention. Strangely enough, he happens to stumble into some sort of relationship with Clementine Kruczyinski (Kate Winslet), a woman who fits with someone like Joel about as well as Kate Winslet fits with a last name like Kruczyinski. Actually, I probably shouldn't say that, since there is something of a discrepancy between my own last name and my appearance. But the point is that Joel and Clementine could not really be more opposite. Joel is introverted and shy, while Clementine is outgoing enough to pursue a friendship with him despite his behavior, which initially shows something of a fear of even talking to her.(spoilers) While it's true that they do not fit together in almost any way, it's a lot of what makes their relationship endearing (and it also provides a lot of what makes the early souring of that relationship more believable). The first downturn of their relationship is first suggested as Joel goes to visit Clementine and she `acts' like she had never even met him, and then it turns out that she has had him erased from her mind by this strange company that specializes in erasing painful or unwanted memories. Sure, this is not exactly the most jarring twist (you already knew what the movie was about, right?), but it's pretty clever how effective the twist is, at least in its simplicity and smallness, as well as the way it is first introduced in the plot. She has had him erased from her mind before the audience is told anything about this memory erasing company. Really the only thing turned upside down (besides Joel's and Clementine's respective grasps on reality) is that she wasn't ACTING like she didn't know him. She wasn't acting at all.When Joel figures out what's going on, he decides to have Clementine erased from his own memory. I have a theory that he does this almost entirely for revenge against her, which may be part of the reason that he so desperately tries to call the whole thing off right in the middle of it. The larger reason being, however, that he has a better relationship with her in the cyberspace of his mind than he did in real life. Their interaction when they are physically together is much less pleasant than it is in Joel's mind, which was also more than likely true before either of them ever went to have their memories erased. Joel has fallen in love with Clementine, and the fact that they turn out to be completely incompatible does not change his dedication to her or his determination to keep her. She, on the other hand, does not fall for every person who shows her any attention.Director Michel Gondry pays extraordinary attention to detail in his movie, probably the main thing that makes the psychological aspect of it so effective. He goes to great lengths to portray the cognitive experiences of memories and dreams as closely as possible to reality in the movie. Consider having a dream where you're in the future and reading the newspaper. You may or may not have had a dream like this (I have), but what would happen is very clearly reflected by events in the movie. I dreamed once that I was reading a newspaper about the presidential election results in November 2004. There was a picture of the winner, a huge headline announcing who the American president would be for the next four years, and a lengthy story detailing the events of the election process. As I looked at the newspaper, I remember staring at it intently, unable to focus on the photographs or quite concentrate enough on the words to read the story. No matter how hard I looked, I couldn't make out a single word or photograph.This, in my theory, is my mind trying to fill in a part of my knowledge that I simply don't know yet, which is why I couldn't make out the words. People around me were also discussing the election results, but their words were a jumble because my mind doesn't know what to put there. All the information was right there in front of me in the newspaper, but my mind couldn't focus on it because, since the event has not happened yet, I simply don't know it. There are scenes in the movie that flawlessly reflect this. People's faces are blurred and distorted because they have been erased from memory, and their voices have been reduced to meaningless noises. They are right there, but Joel can't focus on them because his brain no longer has the file detailing what they look like. While I admit that this kind of mental experience may not be universal, it is extremely rare that I see a movie that so brilliantly reflects a common experience like this. Bravo.The movie twists and turns and messes with chronological time so much that it is almost impossible to describe a chronological plot, but the primary focus of the film is on the workings of the human mind, as well as the vast importance that memories, both good and bad, have in our lives. Without memories, our lives are exactly like Joel finds his journal, just blank. It is a fascinating journey to watch Joel and Clementine racing through the labyrinth of his mind trying to outrun the company that is erasing the very world surrounding him. The movie is similar to the greatest film released in 2003, Big Fish, in that so much of it takes place inside the mind, so anything is possible. The restrictions of reality do not necessarily apply to what Director Michel Gondry can put in the movie. Joel and Clementine are both a little crazy, so anything could happen. I love it when movies are outrageous, but completely justifiably so, which doesn't happen often.As if the movie wasn't outstanding enough, check THIS out. As you may or may not know, Jim Carrey is now one of the most famous actors currently working, and several years ago was honored with a gold star engraved in the sidewalk of Hollywood Boulevard. And can you guess what he and his daughter inscribed with their own fingers in the wet cement below his name, in front of a huge crowd of fans and television cameras?`Merrily merrily merrily.'\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman co-wrote the screenplay for \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" with director Michel Gondry.  Probably Kaufman, continuing his recovery from the largely senseless \"Adaptation,\" was the prime writer. So a series of sometimes faintly explicable or borderline incoherent scenes somewhat camouflages an occasionally fascinating tale.  And that's what this film is.Joel (Jim Carrey) is a writer-illustrator with an unbroken record of failed relationships.  He's shy and lonely, open to falling in like if not in love with any attractive female who telegraphs an interest in him.Calling in sick on Valentine's Day, he goes out to Montauk Point (the easternmost part of New York's Long Island, a playground for the rich) and runs into Clementine (Kate Winslet), a bubbling, blithe spirit, a young woman who works in a Barnes & Noble bookstore and frequently changes her hair color from one attention grabbing shade to another (her idea of a perfect color name is \"Agent Orange\").A relationship starts and goes into high gear when, after almost a quarter of an hour, the opening credits roll.  That's a hint that an unconventional unfolding of plot is in store.Through scenes that too often confuse without enlightening, Clementine and Joel's relationship goes back and forth in time.  Mostly back as it's revealed that each separately engaged the services of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (a laid back role well-played by Tom Wilkinson) to have their memories of past relationships erased through what must be a proprietary and non-insurance covered process.  Doc Howard's sci-fi practice enjoys the eager beaver services of receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst).What follows is contemplation of the role of memory and the opportunity for regeneration of relationships against psychical resistance (to say nothing of overcoming the effects of Mierzwiak's non-FDA approved therapy. \"Lacuna\" is the name of his enterprise.  Erasure leads to a missing part-but without any awareness of what has been deleted by computer machinations of a mapped brain there can be no sense of incompleteness.  There's a message here. Perhaps others can find and detail it.What fails is the too cute, confusing and slapdash alternation of time and place.  What succeeds is a surprisingly deep and laid back performance by Carrey, his second film in which his character's memory loss is central to the story.  Winslet, wacko hair colors and all, is engaging and warm, a woman who really wants the security and permanency of a close relationship but who has been hurt too often.Dunst displays a broad range of emotions from the freely and stoned sensual to the pained introspective.  A nice supporting role for this very talented actress.  Elijah Wood as Patrick, one of the doctor's nocturnal memory erasers, is flat-perhaps he hadn't decompressed sufficiently from his long foray into the wilds of New Zealand.The beach scenes at Montauk are nicely shot-the rolling Atlantic waves in the dead of winter are beautiful.  But there's a choppy quality to much of the cinematography that adds to the film's already scrambled elements.\n",

      "I find nothing special in this movie. Maybe it has a unique story but overall it was so bad. People are amazed by new things so this film sold well because of that. The story could be exhibited well and it could be a great movie but they simply spoiled the story and good actors like Jim Carrey (I accept that Kate Winslet has very good performance here) and Elijah Wood. The things that Stan and Mary did in Joel's flat was just so pathetic and not ethic.

      "I have reviewed this movie to make the review. I knew I did not like it, but I wanted to be specific. Seeing the other time, I see that I still do not like it, but I see that there are still more things that I did not remember and that I do not like. It's a great idea, although well thought out is a very dangerous idea, very sad and at the same time, I do not know if they stop to think that the human being is what is good and bad that happens to him and remember what he has lived . Without remembering things, you run the risk of repeating the bad ones. I'll need the spoiler part to explain some thingsThe actors are all great, yes, each one is more crazy than the previous one. I do not know how many people in real life would hold any of them more than a little while and would fall in love with them.He has a photograph that I would define as non-existent. There are moments when the light overflows the screen. In others he uses photography for two things, to make a different film and to cover, especially at night, all the faults.His address seems a little boring. I think the intermediate section seems very long. Apart from his typical style in all his films, the planes he makes are sometimes even poorly composed.I would ask people if they really want to forget about their past. It may seem great to the naked eye, but if something makes us human is the good and the bad and learn to overcome the bad times.Spoiler:The part that I like about the movie, the \"idea\" of forgetting the bad and even finding it again and falling in love with it would be nice if it were not so badly carried out. I think he spends most of the movie obsessing the character with not accepting what is no longer, however the nice part that you finally find your partner again, you only have a few minutes of film, nothing more and That is for me one of the big mistakes.It also has things as typical as the love of Kirsten Dunst with the boss, I have seemed a total topic.\n",

      "Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play young lovers who eventually have a falling out and their relationship ends. A bit later, Carrey sees her and she has no recollection of him--how could this be?! Later, Carrey learns that there is an organization that can wipe out specific memories and he realizes she's done this. And so, he decides to do the same. However, it's not that easy--Carrey really does love her down deep. Later, when they meet again, the story becomes VERY interesting and ends on a sweet romantic note.I read one review which said that \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" was incredibly original. Well, while it's original in some ways, the basic plot idea is actually recycled from an old movie from 1939, \"Remember?\". \"Remember?\" had a novel idea but the execution left a bit to be desired. In that film, Robert Taylor and Greer Garson marry and eventually grow to hate each other. They are offered a new experimental drug so they will forget each other completely--and they end up falling in love all over again! Well, if you take this idea and update it--this is, essentially, \"Eternal Sunshine\"....though this recent film is much better and ends well.Now I am not saying \"Eternal Sunshine\" is a great film. While it's rated extremely highly on IMDb, I disliked the style of the film at times. Lots of handycam shots and indie music made the film seem a tad pretentious at times. Plus, I was disappointed about the rough language in the film as it made it a rated-R film and the movie could have easily been a PG or PG-13 film--one that anyone could watch. But, if you can look past this, there is a sweetness about it that makes it worth your time.\n",

It works so arduously to be clever and touching but it isn't either. I got the point of the story, and I understood the direction and feel of the movie, I just didn't care. I was told by numerous people that they thought of me while watching this movie, and I had to see it. I wish I hadn't, honestly. Just a long, boring disappointment.Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) was an unlikeable character. Nothing about her or her actions made me care about her in the slightest.I just kept wishing the memory-erasing technology would slip, and wipe Joel Barish's (Jim Carrey) slate completely clean, he'd forget he was a character in a story, and the movie would end.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a film which could, just, have worked. It is based around a science fiction concept which is the precise opposite of the one which forms the basis of \"Total Recall\". That film posits that that at some time in the future neuro-technology will have advanced to the point where it is possible to implant false memories into a person's brain- that is to say memories which the person believes to be genuine but which in fact relate to events that have never taken place. \"Eternal Sunshine¬Ö",
      "..\", by contrast, explores the possibility that it might be possible to use neuro-technology to remove unwanted memories from a person's brain. Unlike \"Total Recall\", which is explicitly set several centuries in the future, it seems to be set in the present day; the fictional technique of \"Targeted Memory Erasure\" is the only futuristic thing about it.The film tells the story of two lovers, Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski who meet, fall in love, fall out of love again and separate. When Joel seeks out Clementine to try for a reconciliation, he finds that she has no memories of him and discovers that she has used the services of a firm called Lacuna, Inc to erase all memories of him from her mind. On the basis that what is sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander, Joel decides that he will also have his mind wiped of all memory of Clementine and makes an appointment with Lacuna. During the mind wiping procedure, however, he decides that he wants to remember Clementine after all.This was a film which came as a great disappointment to me. Kirsten Dunst may have a fine nose for mediocrity, but its other stars have all starred in some of the finest films of recent years, Kate Winslet in \"Heavenly Creatures\" and Branagh's \"Hamlet\", Jim Carrey in \"The Truman Show\", Tom Wilkinson in \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" and \"Valhalla\", and Elijah Wood in the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Winslet, admittedly, is an actress I am never quite sure about. It may seem unpatriotic to say so, given her current status of National Treasure Grade One in Britain, but her acting veers between the brilliant, as in \"Heavenly Creatures\" or the recent \"Revolutionary Road\", the good (\"Sense and Sensibility\"), the average (\"Titanic\", \"Iris\"), the technically proficient but soulless (\"The Reader\"), and the frankly weird (\"Hideous Kinky\"). Her performance here falls firmly into the final category, (although \"Eternal Sunshine¬Ö",
      "..\" is a far weirder film than \"Hideous Kinky\" ever knew how to be). Her Clementine comes across as so emotionally dysfunctional (polite euphemism for bitch) that it is easy to understand just why Joel wanted every trace of her eradicated from his memory. What is more difficult to understand is why he changed his mind about the process or, indeed, fell in love with her in the first place. Jim Carrey can also be brilliant, as he was in \"The Truman Show\", but falls a long way short of repeating that triumph here, with his Joel coming across as just dull.The film seems to have plenty of admirers, currently being ranked at No. 62 on the IMDb Top 250 and having been nominated for all sorts of awards. I realise, therefore, that I am in a minority when I say that I disliked it. Part of the problem was that it is a romantic comedy (of sorts) where I was unable to sympathise with either of the principal characters, but the main reason for my dislike was that Michel Gondry's tricksy direction made the plot so difficult- at times impossible- to follow. \"Eternal Sunshine\" has been compared to \"Being John Malkovich\", the script for which was written by the same writer, Charlie Kaufman, but I found that film much clearer to understand.Gondry, particularly during the sequences where Joel's memory is being wiped, uses a number of disorientating techniques such as distorted perspective and an extreme form of non-linear narrative. The film jumps suddenly from Joel's memories, some recent, some of the more distant past, to scenes set in the present, which makes it very difficult to piece together exactly what is going on. The effect has been described as \"surrealistic\", but I have always found Surrealism to be something which works better on canvas, as in the works of Salvador Dali and Giorgio de Chirico, than it does on the cinema screen, except in small doses, an example being the dream sequence Dali designed for Hitchcock's \"Spellbound\". The best thing about \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is its quirky title- a line from Alexander Pope's \"Eloisa to Abelard\". 3/10\n",

      "Joel Barrish has a love-hate relationship with his girlfriend Clementine. But after things fall apart, the relationship goes from strained to bizarre: she has visited Lacuna, a service that deletes or erases people from your memory. Everything that was Joel in her mind is now gone. Joel, not wanting to be heartbroken alone, follows suit and undergoes the same treatment -- only to discover halfway through that even the worst memories come with good ones and both are important.Not surprisingly, this film is beautiful and sad. Why am I not surprised? Because it comes from Charlie Kaufman, who also brought us \"Adaptation\" and \"Being John Malkovich\". Kaufman has the power to make the strange familiar and is something of a kingmaker in the world of acting -- \"Adaptation\" may well be Nicolas Cage's best work, and this may well be Jim Carrey's. All those who doubted he could play serious roles had been proved otherwise. Kate Winslet also compliments him well and offers a nice departure for those used to her from \"Titanic\".If one wants, they can get into some great existential questions with this film: are bad memories important? Is it wrong to remove them? Are we destined to meet and love certain people or certain types of people? There's some wonder about the morality of removing another person from your memory and the biggest question of whether or not we need those memories to shape us. This film quotes Nietzsche and Alexander Pope -- but not one of Nietzsche's more well-known quotations: that which doesn't kill us only serves to make us stronger. Isn't that what pain is? A catalyst for growth? The supporting cast is excellent. Mark Ruffalo has a breakout performance (though not quite on par with \"Zodiac\") and Kirsten Dunst is pretty lovable as Mary (though still not as lovable as Maggie Gyllenhaal). Elijah Wood also appears, which is good or bad depending on your love for Elijah Wood, I imagine.You will have to ignore certain continuity questions (if you see someone every day for two years, what becomes of those two years with them removed) but that really isn't the point of the film anyhow. It's about fate and chance (see also \"No Country For Old Men\"). And it's amazing, easily deserving the accolades hoisted upon it. If you're inexperienced, make this a top priority in your life.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a beautifully complex and subtle film, insightful in its message and imaginative in its execution of that message. There is honestly nothing that I would bring against this movie to disparage it, and, thus, my review of it is not filled with sarcastic bits of wit or amusing, mocking exaggerations--no, truthfully, I can offer only my compliments to it, and the people who made it possible. An amazingly innovative director, Michel Gondry's creativity is the perfect guiding force behind the movement of the story. As for the casting, I think it was done practically without a single error. I have always been a huge fan of both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and these are proved to be two of their most unique, well-acted roles. The supporting cast are equally matched to their characters, and, reiterating, I have no complaint whatsoever about the acting (even though I'm not usually much of a Kirsten Dunst fan). The cinematography was also notable due to the work of Ellen Kuras, who made each scene inside Joel's subconscious whimsical, bizarre, and even nostalgic. But, in the end, I think, as with most great movies, the credit goes first and foremost to screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, whose genius allowed him to create a story that was not only well-constructed, multifaceted, and enlightening, but also warm, touching, and true-to-life. Eternal Sunshine is a film suited for those who truly adore movies--not adolescent fans of explosions, graphics, and Hollywood romance--for it does not race along at light speed, but, instead, progresses slowly, taking the necessary time to create an incredible portrait of love, memories, and dreams.\n",

      "This is a really good movie just kind of confusing. i have a question, how long were they going out b4 clementine erased him from her memory, was it just the 3 days because as he was getting erased i couldn't tell if they had been going out for a while and he was just trying to change memories that he had so that he wouldn't forgot her or if he just really liked her when they first met, it just wasn't clear, it was confusing. i understand that he was trying to change his memories so that it wouldn't be erased, but there were a lot of memories and i thought they were only going out for a little bit like they just met and she got him out of her memory because of a little fight. someone clarify this for me. i don't even think i wrote this in a way that you guys would understand haha. i'm tired and there were a lot of parts in this movie that were confusing.\n",

      "It was funny and it mad you think through the whole movie, also mad me think about love and when i was a kid. Some parts were a bit confusing but if you watch it one more time you will probably get it. Another thing i never saw the cord of Clem's Mic in her shirt at the scene when she gets her tooth brush. Jim Carey is a great all around actor mostly funny in that movie he acted like an innocent virgin.Kate Winslet was a weird girl that died her hair 30 days a week but it is a great movie highly recommend it! Also one name for her hair color could of been eternal Sunshine (my idea) award to Jim for the best actor in that film.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is hardly like any other movie I have watched,in a good way of course.It deals with the two main characters,Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski(2004 Academy Awards Best Actress nominee Kate Winslet) who meet each other and strike up a relationship between each other.Clementine gets her memory erased to forget the bad parts of her relationships.Joel finds out and does the same after meeting the creator of the process,Dr Howard Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson).Kirsten Dunst,Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood join the ride in this romantic-dramatic and sometimes comedic film about the poignant looks of breakups,breakdowns and breakthroughs in a stereotypical romance between lovers.\n",
      "583\n",
      "I avoided this movie because I thought I would never see anything starring Jim Carrey (Dumb & Dumber, The Cable Guy, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls) that was worth watching. That was my loss.Kate Winslet(Little Children) was absolutely brilliant in this film by Oscar-winner Charlie Kaufman. And, of course, one of my very favorites, Kirsten Dunst, also gave a great performance.I have to admit that I have a new appreciation for Carrey after seeing this film. He was perfect for the role and pulled it off spotlessly.No matter how bad it is, there is always something special about that relationship. So, just remember the good times.\n",
      "584\n",
      "I watched this film and didn't like it. For starters, I wanted to see Jim Carrey playing the sort of character which is funny, but also has more depth. Well in this film, Jim's character had too much depth and not enough humour.Kate Winslet's character was presented well, but again, I would say she was unfunny. The rest of the supporting cast lacked a lot of imagination but there were a few interesting characters such as Ellijah Woods.The plot in this film is confusing and seems to have some flaws in between. You have to listen carefully to the dialogue and try to understand the film as a story, not a romantic comedy, otherwise, like me, you'll end up bored and not satisfied.\n",

      "I watched this a year ago, and I thought this film was a work of art. Now I'm watching it after finding out I'm dying from pancreatic cancer (so they say) and in addition to Kate winslet actually looking like the last love of my life, the story has multiple meanings that are manifesting after a couple viewings.How it points out these things that almost universaly affect us all is just amazing.I think of Amy and the the things about her that got to me early on, and then the negatives from us both that ended the relationship. Now as I contemplate, she having gotten married to someone else, and having sought me out when troubles were going on a couple years back,well, this movie put's those thoughts in perspective.I'm re-watching it now, and contemplating giving her a call, just to put this life's acts in a meaningfull perspective.This film hits on those areas we sometimes don't take seriously enough.Great movie.\n",

      "I am STILL waiting for SOMETHING to happen in this movie!I just knew that I would find many folks praise this bizarre movie simply because of its oddness. I actually HAD to force myself to finish watching this movie. I turned it off three times and I will sit through just about anything!! It is sooo pretentious and DULL. Unless one enjoys STUDYING camera tricks and angles, I just can't see where the enjoyment lies. There are problems from the start but I will focus on only two. 1. CASTING mistake. Jim Carey does a respectable job playing with his \"serious actor's face.\" On the other hand, Kate Winslet is quite miscast as a bohemian, free-spirited, American. She fails on ALL three counts. Everything about her screams UPTIGHT. Watching Kate Winslet play a carefree American is about as convincing as watching your conservative granny turn into a glamorous sex kitten after simply putting on a mini skirt and go-go boots. Who NEEDS to see that mess?? Is she from New York or Boston? Her accent is very flat, very Midwestern with many lapses into a musical British twang. Was anyone coaching her on her accent at all?? She is a competent actress in most films, but few actresses can play ANY role. She is a glaring mistake that made it impossible for me to buy her role or CARE. 2. Where is the STORY? Problem number TWO is shocking to me. This movie takes an interesting idea and goes NOWHERE. Imagine this movie filmed in a direct, straight forward way ... NOTHING special, right? If the filming technique and style become the story, than there wasn't one to begin with. I do not care about the characters and I am not awed that the scenes are filmed out of order. Where is the plot? I tried to find one but despite forcing my eyes to stay open, I was just bored. Really bored.Bottom line: Interesting idea and filming technique in places. Overall, BORING and dreary.\n",

      "this is a hard movie to review.i mean,it has a unique premise:that it is possible to erase selected memories from your mind,so you can forget any heartache and pain.that's sort of the gist,but things don't actually work out quite that way for the characters involved. aside from the unique premise,i found the movie hard to follow and much to slow and melancholy.it's also much too methodical for my tastes.it seems to dwell too long on certain scenes or situations.the movie is also very bizarre at times.this is no summer popcorn movie.it's definitely deep.too deep for me. i guess it's sort of a lesson that there's just some things you shouldn't mess with as there may be unexpected repercussions. i found the movie on the cusp of being compelling,just enough to keep watching to the end.the acting in the movie is good.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play the two lead characters.the supporting cast is also strong.this movie won't make you feel uplifted,so if you're feeling down,you might want to hold off on this movie.all things considered,the most i can give \"eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a 5/10\n",

      "It's approximately 4:30AM as I am writing this. I've just watched Charlie Kaufman's (as well as Michel Gondry's, of course) most absolute masterpiece once again, and I'm literally trembling with emotion. It saddens me that because of my lacking vocabulary there is no way I'd be able to express the state of mind that I'm currently in, but oh man, I have to try.For some people it's Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart's irresistible charm and Ingrid Bergman's divine beauty, for some it's Chocolat with the ever so handsome hippie-like Johnny Depp, but for me the greatest love story ever caught on film and the one film that I will be watching over and over again for as long as I shall live is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. With scenes filled with such emotion and such beauty, like the rain sequence with Joel's childhood coming to play, it triggers something so profound in me, that it's simply impossible to describe in words.I have recently gone through a rough patch with my girlfriend, and through my difficulties I find it even more satisfying to watch the main characters' story evolve (or devolve, actually) with such plausible dialogue and with such honesty in details.The heart and soul of this film really are the actors, mainly Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. They share such enviable chemistry and just seem so perfect for each other, even in moments of argument. Opposites attract, and with Carrey as the insecure and mellow Joel Barish and Winslet as the lively, slightly bipolar Clementine Kruczynski, they make the perfect on-screen couple. Carrey and Winslet are also supported by some great performances by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson.The film of course wouldn't be anything if it weren't for Michel Gondry and his unique visual style that gives the film the kind of hand-made look it graves. With little computer-effects, most of the work is done by hand, thus keeping the film even more in the ground as opposed to plunging into CGI-scifi. The color themes and the contrasts that Gondry uses are all coherent and brilliantly selected, and cinematographer Ellen Kuras is doing an amazing job with her raw visual style that fits seamlessly into Gondry's vision. The soundtrack is another thing that deserves endless praise, Beck's bittersweet \"Everybody's Got To Learn Sometime\" is just one of the high points.But it's the story of these two lovers, struggling through their difficulties only to once again find the joy they once shared, that makes this film the masterpieces that it is. It is only by a collaboration of remarkably talented individuals, that something like this can be achieved.\"Love conquers all\" might be a worn-out phrase, but after seeing this film it's a little easier to believe that there might be some truth behind it after all.It is now 5AM, and I am already yearning back into the film's world, back into the lives of Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. I am in love all over again.\n",

      "Cannot believe this movie received this high of a rating, it was watchable ,but barely. Definitely is not a repeat watch!! Worse movie Jim Carrey has made to date... This is not even a top 1000 movie.This could have been a very good movie. The idea was a very good one, however it skipped and jumped all over the place continually leaving you scratching your head making you wonder why you would rent this movie. One of Jim Carrey's earlier movies, Copper Mountain, was pretty bad, but it was an early work, and had no plot what so ever.As stated, made it through it once, but will never care to watch it again. My son is a huge fan of Jim Carrey and every thing he does, however we spent time while watching this one making jokes about it to help us get through the movie.\n",

      "I decided to finally bite the bullet and watch this film after many a recommendation from friends and colleagues. As I looked further I saw many familiar faces and institutions - Charlie Kaufman; screenplay writer for Adaptation (a nine out of ten for me), scriptwriter/composer of Being John Malkovich. Focus Films who were involved with a number of films I highly regard namely '21 Grams'. Charlie Kaufman presents, a film which promises to out do any of my expectations. It promises to take me by the hand and make me feel that anything is possible; reverse my psyche to a childlike state, and take me to a world of lost memories, undying love - a world where imagination overrules all. Let us dive in and see what all the fuss is about.I must say, approximately twenty four hours after pressing play, I keep having Freudian slips; my mind keeps re-living moments of the film, throwing them into my conscious for me to ponder, decipher. It is hard to pinpoint the magic of this film, as many aspects of it are somewhat flawed, yet it remains so, so beautiful. It leaves a feeling of contempt aimed at our ultimate creator; creating a being with so much feeling, and emotion, thrown into a nonsensical world and left to try to make sense of everything thrown there way. This is a quote which shall stay with me for some time:\"Adults are a mess of sadness and phobias,\" Clementine.I feel that this film could greatly have benefited from being a short. It is a concept film, that should have been pondered more, been cut with more precision, and sucker punched the audience with it's a beauty. Instead we have a feature length film that whilst it retains its beautiful qualities, they only come in pieces, and not as a whole unit. This may be intentional, as the fragmented mind of our protagonist unearths, maybe this disjointed editing, and prolonged length is symbolic ‚Äì I feel still, this film could have been so much more. Some of the set pieces are simply beautiful; the screenplay is, well, simply Kaufman ‚Äì genius. The acting is SUBLIME. Kate Winslet simply blows the mind ‚Äì not that I expected a bad performance. Her portrayal of a girl that will never fully commit herself, someone you can never truly know is inch perfect. You genuinely feel you never actually understand her character or what she wants, almost to the point of despair. Many a times in my life have I met people similar to this, and it is an identical melancholy feeling inside ‚Äì it makes you question if you ever truly know a person, makes you feel useless.I fear I may be spoiling too much, too soon. A magnificent idea , executed well, but still ‚Äì it could have been so, so much more.\n",

      "I had seen this movie before, at the age of 13, the year it was released. I was young, immature and hadn't experienced love besides family love. Never kissed a girl and had it mean something, never said those three words, and thus, my experience of this movie was not something memorable.It left me angry, confused, and feeling cheated of my time. Because I couldn't relate.Fast forward to now, 3 years later and I am an entirely different person. Recently coming off my first ever meaningful relationship, I rented this movie again, because I had been saying I wish I could forget it all. Let me just say this: this movie changed my life.An ingenious plot: a man attempts to have his memory erased of a bad break-up and all things associated with it, with heart, something most Charlie Kauffman movies lack. Teamed with Michel Gondry, it's result is brilliant, captivating, and a truly real representation of an honest relationship. This is, by no means, a fairy tale romantic comedy. This isn't Notebook style kisses in the rain. This isn't flowers and a box of chocolates, and most importantly, this isn't a Hollywood romance.Thinking back on my relationship, I remember all these things that this movie shows us. For me, it wasn't the over-the-top moments that were so special. It was crosswords on the couch, walking her dog in the snowy night scape and falling asleep while watching a movie that are the most special moments I could ever remember.This movie changed me, this movie made me feel more enlightened and grateful, and dispelled all my hate and anger. This movie, if you can relate, will be the greatest representation of the human sense of love that you will ever see. If you haven't loved yet, you will not understand.But if you have, this movie will leave you bewildered, transfixed, and enlightened. It's sheer normalness makes it that much more special.And in being special, this movie is made great. Enjoy it...\n",

      "When I learned that Michael Gondry had directed this a few weeks ago, I became interested in seeing it. Perhaps a dozen of Gondry's videos are so clever and rich that I had hopes his movies would be too. The preview for his next one looks to be on the grating and precious side; something out of the 80s. I was truly surprised that this movie is such an overwrought trifle. Overwrought in that the relationship is barely even registers with a viewer before it requires saving, and a trifle in that many pivotal scenes and the resolution are so weakly written that any of three other relationship in the movie seem more dramatically interesting, and more scaled for the focus of a feature length movie. They don't bear the burden of having to prop up Gondry's rep with some gimmick. The Carrey/Winslet relationship tries to wrestle itself out from under the FX but it never has a prayer. The idea is too intrusive.Videos seem to be Gondry's ideal format. Ideas that can bear five minutes of exploration are his forte. This is not an insult. Let forever be by the Chemical Bros is simply astonishing. As for movies, this is it? The only question Gondry's efforts in the cinema will be answering is how many times will he be allowed to remake Benny & Joon? Addiitonally he's been imprisoned by his age and thus must make something not too far afield from previously acknowledged high-watermarks by his peers. ESOTSM has one eye firmly glued to Being John Malkovich.That said, I was willing to give this the benefit of the doubt up till about the one hour mark where the movies most awful scenes start flowing. Jim Carrey acting like a five year old hiding out under a table. It's just a cheesy, stupid, sphincter-tightening place I wasn't willing to go and thus began a fast forwarding workout. By coincidence this is also where the films poor structure becomes a real liability. As music videos don't require scripts, the movies major flaw is the structuring of the film over a long hour and 45 minutes, and the immature script.Heaping insult on injury, the central relationship is composed only of childish moments, and Winslet is asked to portray nothing more than a b*tchy freak, a surrogate Bjork, the type of girl who should cease to intrigue after the age of 20. I can only see the marketing angles when I see movies now, and the damaged girl who is non-threatening to the target audience of straight guys with low self-esteem is not satisfying to a mature adult viewer. Oooh a misfit who creates her own world.... This is love? making snow angels, girls who dress up potatoes, Puh-lease...There is room for good performances here. Kristin Dunst (who I don't care for) does OK in an adult role and looks quite fine. Mark Ruffalo who has generally been consigned to sensitive hunk perfs is allowed to play a fully-realized and well-acted goofball here. It turns out he has a range viewers haven't seen previously. Whether he's dancing badly in his underwear, or tripping over something and working with it, he's really committed to this character which makes it fun to watch. As supporting roles go, this is a good one and he does good things with it. A few line readings in the movie (from various actors) are really terrific. Overall this precious trip through cheap, easy pathos and childish hogwash invariably reappears in french cinema. Seemingly only the french can stomach emotional lives that receive this treacly treatment. (Ma Vie en Rose, Subway, The Professional, etc.)\n"

      "I love this film! I'm not usually into romance films, but this film is so unique. It's quirky and by no means generic. The story is not put together in chronological order, so some people don't get its brilliance. I personally LOVE the way the film is done, and Kate Winslet's character and performance is great.(Clementine is so wonderfully eccentric!). Jim Carrey delivers an equally great performance(Joel is sensitive and introverted, not traits you often attribute to Jim Carrey, but he plays it SO well!). It deals with themes like the pain of love, consequences of actions and even the boundaries of science (in regards to memory erasure). This film is thought provoking but not soppy. Watch this film! it's amazing!\n",

      "This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I don't know much about Kaufman or Gondry...but ever since I have watched this movie, I am a blind fan of them. Wow !What should I say to describe the story? Its not exactly romantic. There is an important sci-fi story in it, though that is only a backdrop. When you see the movie, you really do not bother about the technological explanations for the plot. The story is about love. Love, in the most practically illogical way it can be ! I did not know that Jim Carrey could perform such a serious and grave role with such brilliance. He changed my 8-years-old mindset for him. Kate Winslet is, as ever, beautiful and expressive. The story goes somewhat like this: Joel ( Carrey ) is in real sufferings when he comes to know that his lady love Clementine (Winslet) has erased him out of his memory to forget their sour and painful love life. Unable to bear the pain, that to the person, without whom he can not live, does not even recognize him, he goes for the same memory evaporation method. But is a decision made of impulsive agony would be right ? When he is operated by the technicians, his subconscious mind becomes the active one and tries to hide her memories . The eerie and imaginary desperation of a man trying to hold on to the last bits of memory is what makes the whole story. Some subplots do come in, which even works as spices to the original story. And, of course there is the conclusion. Can we really sacrifice the good parts of being in love to forget the pains and sufferings ? Guys, whoever has not seen it, please watch it. You will like it the way I did, maybe even more.\n",

      "I'm not a critic, I'm just a guy who loves great cinema.\"Eternal Sunshine\" as I'll call it in order for you to actually remember the title, is somewhat of a mix of dream-state, and flat out getto-fantasy. It's a very dark film that has some beautiful truths in it about love, memories, and reality itself.Jim Carrey was of course the perfect choice for this film, and he's actually able to pull off a striking performance. I had only wished that he had been nominated for Best Actor, which he certainly deserved to be nominated for. It seems that the Academy can't seem to let Jim get beyond his Jerry Lewis phase into fine acting. Look at \"Man on the Moon\" sometime and see that both films left Jim excluded from his rightful place as a terrific actor.But ultimately, Jim is stretched by brilliant Michel Gondry directing, and a story that only Charlie Kaufman could have pulled off. This strange marriage between Carrey, Gondry, and Kaufman made for one of the most bizarre mixes since \"Brazil\". Across the board, this film is strange, but it makes complete sense as long as you stick with it. And although some of the sequences are downright scary, moody, and insane, the truth of a man searching for love and himself turns the film (for those who wait) into one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.I don't know much about anyone that worked on this film, other than to say that I know Mr. Carrey's work, as well as Gondry having worked on music videos for Bjork. That said, I went into the film planning to see something with that Carry touch, and walked out seeing much more than I expected. It was clear to me that Gondry had his hands full with Carrey, but also that all of the people involved seemed to know that this was a film that would push the limits of what an audience could take. For myself however, I feel that I was designed to be pushed, and felt comport from a collection of artists that didn't seem to \"give a damn\". Way to go for all of them! In the end, it's clear that people went with their gut, and that Gondry's hand was so strong on this wild picture, that no one would ever have guessed it was even possible. This film is the one and only film I have seen to date where I literally sat in certain sequences and said to myself, \"How did they do that?\" That's saying a lot for someone that reads effects magazines and has made several films himself.I have to say that if you haven't seen the film, get it, sit back, don't see it when you're tired (for God's sake), and get ready for a mind-screw not unlike that of Chris Nolan's \"Memento\". It's totally worth messing with your own head, I promise.B.D.Kuchera\n",

      "Stellar! Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey compliment each other as Clem and Joel, a couple who have a falling out after which the former decides to go have a procedure that would erase virtually every memory of the latter from her existence. Joel (Carrey), thinking that Clem (Winslet) has undergone the procedure is stark, raving, mad at her and decides to go have the same thing done himself. The catch is that Clem didn't actually erase the memories, she was planning to until she changed her mind, but Joel doesn't know this until after the procedure has already been started on him. Things get pretty wacky, funny, and whimsical from here on in the plot. Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson round out the superb supporting cast! A must see if you haven't seen it. Winslet received her 4th Oscar nomination for her role as Clementine Kruzensky. This film is also a part of my DVD collection.\n",

      "When people think of a film, there is always an immediate assumption that the director is the key force that should be rewarded, or the actors. It is a shame that people forget about the script writers, because Charlie Kaufmans pedigree has resulted in some of the most original and satisfying films that have ever been made, and done so in less then a decade. This is one of them.Imaging a future were a person can have their memories of something they don't like erased, it follows the path of a man who hopes to forget his ex girlfriend. As he slowly goes through the process, he finds himself trying to hang on to them. This is an incredibly deep film which has many dark themes involved, but it is also incredibly moving.The visuals are certainly well used, and the acting is of the highest quality from all involved, though the leads are outstanding. If there anything to say to deter people, it is that is a very sad film for the most part, but it is hard to deny that it is still a work of art that represents Kaufman at the peak of his powers. Amazing.\n",

      "I wish I could get both my time and my money back. Jim Carrey is charming and hard working in this, hard working because the script certainly doesn't help him - it is paper thin. Parts of it even sound improvised. I got a small taste of chemistry between the two principals who are broadly drawn, very little depth. The attraction of opposites is inferred though not enough. Kate Winslet is a fine actress but here she is woefully miscast as colourful Clementine, the wild child who works at Barnes and Noble in what looks suspiciously like her underwear. No one knows what Joel does for a living, it would have been interesting to find out, he is so tamped down. I rather liked the character of Mary, played by Kristen Dunst, and felt a story around her would have captured my interest more. I guess the point was that chemistry will triumph over and over again even if the memories are dumped. But do we want our memories, no matter how painful, deleted? For aren't our memories all we really have? To shape and strengthen and even change us for the better. What am I doing? Re-working the pitiful script? A good cast wasted. Leave these plot contrivances behind, Charlie Kaufman, and move on to something fresh and new. You're beginning to sound like Little Sir Echo. 5 out of 10.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman has written brilliant and fantastic movies; I come on BEING JOHN MALCOVICH, APADTATION, CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, and even the flawed yet great HUMAN NATURE. Now this has to be his best film he ever wrote or will write again. Director Micheal Gondry, who tackled on HUMAN NATURE, redeems himself with this work of art. Who would ever think being so spotless will be so amazing.Joel(Jim Carry) has just been through a horrible break-up with the love of his life Clementine(Kate Winslet). He is even more upset to find out that she had her memory erased of him. So out of anger he decides to do it too. Under the process, he finds out by the inventor, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson), that he will still be awake and active; just in his brain. Also under the procedure, he finds out that even though him and Clementine are no longer together, he still loves her. So he tries to hide her in memories she shouldn't be in.This movie centers on how strong love is no matter how many fights or break-ups we endure. It weird, but seems like something that'll really happen. Jim Carrey, my idol as a toddler, has an unique way of being funny and serious in a calm way; a way we are not use to seeing him in and is brilliant for showing us he's emotions to this role. Kate, on the other hand seems to have a role we would see Jim in, but makes it her on and totally steals the show on the comedy side. Elijah Wood is a perfect example of being a evil weasel, showing a great potential in being a great villain, cough...SIN CITY...cough. I always wanted to see Kirsten Dunst high now I do and loved her for it. Mark Ruffalo has fun with his part and dragged me along with him. Tom Wilkinson has showed me that being so serious can be so funny at times. All in all everybody did great, I mean everyone. So watch this Wonderful, Wonderful film and feel happy with the one you love, through the good times and worst times.

      "Did everyone else see a different movie?The best thing this guy could do is get away from this trashy crude jerk of a woman. Move on. Guess he needed a sticker to remind him to stay away after his memory was erased? If the point was, if you forget the truly hideous things about people you can make the same mistake again, okay...But as a great film? I think not! This is the type of fluff that isn't even worth the dollar show, and I feel for you if you actually bring this home from the rental store. The reason for this romance is up there with the romance in Star Wars Episode II. People like Clementine should come with warning labels. It might be different if there was something actually compelling about Clementines character, but there isn't. All I can see is a poor fool making the same mistake twice, and that isn't quality entertainment.\n",

      "Forget the director. Forget the stars. This film is all Charles Kaufman. If you like his unique angle of vision, you'll probably love this film. If you don't, you'll doubtless find it un-involving and ultimately a bore. I'm in the second category. I've yet to see anything Kaufman has written that I've really liked. On the face of it, this one would seem to have possibilities. Two characters -- Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet -- with exasperating personalities have fallen in love and then out of love. They each go separately to a doctor who claims to be able to erase a person entirely from the patient's mind. It works on Carrey's character but not entirely. Not an original plot but given a Kaufmanesque twist, played for laughs and romance rather than for mystery or horror. As in other films Kaufman has written, there's a hall of mirrors aspect to the film that deliberately confuses the viewer. Ho hum. Despite a charming performance by Winslet and pretty good ones by Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo in the subplot, this movie lost traction with me about half way through. Frankly, I didn't give a damn what happened to the characters. The ratings the film received from critics and from contributors to this site would amaze me except that I long ago learned that \"no one ever went broke underestimating\" the taste of young American sophisticates (with apologies to the author of the original quote). It would not surprise me to learn that this audience has already made Charles Kaufman a very rich young man.\n",

      "This movie was an interesting twist on the usual themes of love and meeting \"the one.\" On the surface Jim Carrey's character and Kate Winslet's Clementine seem ill-suited to each other and the break up seems in inevitable. But when the sci-fi memory erasing kicks in and they attempt to erase each other from their respective memories is when this movie gets interesting. It is a colorful, wild ride. Not my favorite movie, but it was entertaining. I suppose it was inevitable that Kirsten Dunst's character turns into the woman scorned who returns everyone's memory tapes, but that whole part of the film was a little sleazy. I think all of the performers did amazing characterizations. It was truly unique and gets points just for that. If you are not fond of the weird and the deep, rent Laws of Attraction. But, if you don't mind coloring outside the lines, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is worth a look.\n",

      "It is incredible with how boring a film one can achieve the notion of great cinema. \"Eternal Sunshine\" lacks originality, inspiration and cinematic inventiveness.We observe a couple, Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey, admittedly great actors, who find the \"true love\". Or at least something like this. The beginning promises an enchanted film: Carrey, a pretty ordinary guy, standing on the platform waiting for his commuter train, decides spontaneously to take a day off and go to the beach. There a girl, Kate Winslet, introduces herself to him and they spend the day together. After the introductory credits, he meets her again and she does not seem to know her. Then we get to know the story how she had him erased from her memory and he decides to do likewise. As the erasing is being done, the technician, just the perfect nerd, is having a little party with his girlfriend and the erasing gets out of hand. At the same time, we see the scenes from his life with Kate Winslet, which are being erased. Carrey decides to keep the memories and so he imagines her in his childhood, so that the technicians can find her. These episodes are just a series of pretty conventional episodes of a love story as we have seen it hundreds of times. And the imagined scenes of Kate Winslet in Carreys childhood lack any originality besides funny images of a big Jim Carrey, the size of the small Jim Carrey under his mother's kitchen table, which is not exactly a revolution (just compare the fantasy scenes in Carax \"Les amants de Pont Neuf\", to name just one example of more than ten years ago).It is pretty soon in the movie that we understand, that the scene at the beginning was an episode that has taken place after the two had their memories erased and meet again. Thus we never lose track of what is happening (which would have been interesting in a film about a loss of memory or \"virtual reality\" - compare for example David Fincher \"The Game\"). Eventually, with the two back together, or at least the possibility of this, we learn, that true love is a sentiment beyond particular memories. We had already guessed. And we know that erasing memories is cruel. Yeap, that's true!There are a number of interesting ideas and string scenes, for example when one of the technicians takes on the role of Carrey and cites lines he has stolen from his belongings, in trying to approach Winslet, but all of this is just not enough to carry the whole film.This movie has about the narrative quality of a mediocre video clip. And because his director has done video clips, we might have at least expected some visual creativity. But, helas, nothing. A hand camera is all we get, yet we never understand why. The film has a basic disposition of a classic movie, with the additional ingredient of 5% MTV. \"It might be an avantgarde movie, and even if it has none of its qualities, it shows all its defects\", says the critic in Fellinis 8 1/2 and it seems that he has give a description of this film.\n",

      "Perhaps this film would have been better had it been shorter, I don't know. All I know is that I'm quite disappointed with it. I didn't expect anything special (after all I didn't choose this film, my boyfriend did) but I did expect something, anything, to happen. But no... I might as well have left after the first 30 minutes, gone down to the nearest pub for a pint of cider and a chat with some friends, and come back to see the last 15 minutes without missing anything of importance to the story. I didn't do that though. Maybe I should have. Oh well. I'm guessing it just wasn't my kind of film. Spending more than an hour watching someones memories of lost love isn't exactly my idea of entertainment. I give this film 2/10.\n",

      "First off, the consensus that this movie is unique is bogus. Anyone thinking that need look no farther than Total Recall. Memory manipulation is well-traveled territory in sci-fi and simply removing the action does not a unique movie make. Not to say a fresh take on the potentials of the technology is impossible, but this movie fails to do so. Here memory removal plays a very small role that does no more than exaggerate the classic \"I'm throwing out your stuff and moving on\" routine, an event so thin it can barely maintain a jeans commercial much less a motion picture.The core failure of this picture is that it tries to force together two people who obviously should not be. She's a flaky hipster prone to severe mood swings and he's an introverted nebbish with zero social skills. At these two extreme ends of the spectrum there's no chance of working it out by meeting in the middle. All they have in common is personality disorders and that's a poor basis for a relationship. Spiderman 2 has a similar failing.Speaking of Spiderman 2, we are once again subjected to the screen presence of Kirsten Dunst. This time she's the center of a B-plot (straight out of soap opera textbooks) that hijacks the third act. Girl has affair with married man, gets \"amnesia\" and forgets affair, has affair reintroduced to her memory and - oh-so-conveniently - confronts married man in front of a well-lit window facing the street where his wife has just pulled up in her car. The wife, as has been played out thousands of times, misinterprets this as infidelity and screeches away with the exasperated husband chasing the car.(Side note: Considering that disposing of all reminders of the removee is required for the memory wipe to succeed, how does Kirsten's character manage to work daily in the same office as her removee with no recall whatsoever?)Tacking on this subplot was unnecessary, but it serves as a welcome break from the excruciatingly slow flashbacks that comprise the bulk of the film. Carrey and Winslet's scenes are well acted and scripted but amount to nothing more than lengthy snippets of a mostly bad romance. More negative drama that only a soaps fan could enjoy. As for reuniting them at the end...There are two lessons to this movie. One is removing your memory (or simply forgetting the past) is a bad idea - a point made several different ways with no subtlety. Two is don't ever give your panties to a guy who works at a fly-by-night brain wiping operation. Let's focus on lesson one. Kirsten and the doctor both learn it the hard way. Carrey and Winslet don't learn it at all; although at their expense the audience does. By getting them back together with no memory of each other the audience knows they are doomed to repeat history. In conveying that point the movie succeeds. Unfortunately there is a long, boring, clich√©d, needlessly convoluted road to travel to get there.3/10\n",

      "This is the kind of slippery, pretentious film, that always tries to remark that it's talking about important issues in an intelligent way, but fails to be intelligent or anything but PRETENTIOUS. It Tries, but fails to be surrealistic. If you want to watch a surreal film try Bu√±uel's \"Un chien andalou\" or \"L'age d'or\". Those films from the 1920's are much more surreal, original, modern, innovative films. About Jim Carrey: I just see him keep playing \"The Mask\", no matter the role he tries. He's a complete collection of tics. Displaying the same face of grief all the film through is not what I consider good acting. He was good at 'The Truman's Show'. In other films I always see Jim Carrey, not the character he tries to give life to.\n",

      "Yet, it is a rather melancholic film. The tone sits between deep sadness and triumphant wholesomeness.It is about loneliness and people trying desperately to find their better half. It starts a typical romantic movie, the boy-meets-girl type. But, there is something a little off. And, as the story progresses you come to realize that the film has multiple layers on top of each other, and in a very Kaufmanesque fashion it becomes a story within a story within a story.In a very clever way, the film tells the story of Joel and Clementine in reverse. And the whole movie is the unwrapping of it. That is why the beginning feels random and weird, without being neccessarily off-putting. The whole movie has a slight weirdness that is gives a dreamlike quality to the story. It elevates a rather mundane romance to a more whimsical tale of invariable love. No matter what, they always end up together.At the core, the movie tells the Joel and Clementine's romance but practically it spends a lot of time on a fictional memory-removal service's office. I enjoyed very much how it presents this whimsical memory technology in a very matter of fact way. There is a quiet routine to it: getting your memories erased is a service you pay for. It is procedure. It is like going to the dentist. Its filled with technicians and supports staff that are morons.And to be fair, the movie almost goes so far into the banality of this practice it almost becomes sinister. The whole sequence with Mark Ruffalo in Joel's apartment verges on uncomfortable and creepy. But, the movie escapes the unease by doing yet again a nested story, where it plunges the story in another story: the romance between Dr. Mierzwiak and Kristen Dunst.It completely caught me off guard. And again, it results in a love-story told from the end. But, it wraps the plot in a nice bow. The film presents two main love-stories, one that has failed and one that has endured, both in spite of the memory removal. The contrast is also visual: where the first love story is told extensively in various colorful flashbacks, the Dunst love-story is told in the office; it is cold, it is static. Ultimately, the juxtaposition of the two stories, creates a deeper meaning.The movie is very good on all accounts, the directing, the acting, the visuals. But, it really gets these elements working together to tell the story. Only while writing this, did I realize how intricate the story is. Yet, the film makes it clear and simple. The movie is eloquent yet it is very ethereal, it feels like a dream. At times, it threatens to turn into a nightmare, but at the end it reveals itself to be a nice, comfy, sweet dream.\n",

      "Joel Barish, a broken man who crashes and burns over his ex-girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski, finds out that she has erased him from her memory by hiring Lacuna Inc., a firm performing such brain damage procedures in their clients' sleep. Enraged, he decides to do the same to her, but only to hit the rock bottom reality of his persistent love for her midway through the procedure. How will he deal with the erasing Clementine in his sleep? How will he manage to keep her memory when he wakes up in the morning? What does it take to forget the past and start anew? Charlie Kaufman, known for his use of warped logic, gives the answer beautifully in a tale of love that lives but doesn't last.\n",

      "Equally praiseworthy are the performances by all. Carrey and Winslet work magic and acquaint you to Joel and Clementine powerfully, supporting Kaufman's character foundation. There's a precision in the mechanism of the film as it unfolds and blends together all the performances giving rise to one of the greatest films of 21st century.\n",
      "Interestingly, the pivotal character is that of Mary Svevo, the receptionist at Lacuna. Kirsten Dunst fulfills Mary's emotional portrayal effectively, stealing the screen from Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood playing Mary's colleagues Stan and Patrick and Tom Wilkinson as Mary's boss, Howard Mierzwiak. Proof is the title scene where Mary recites a quotation from 'Eloisa To Abelard' which is probably a scene that'll be remembered for years in the cinematic universe.\n",

      "For many years, I have been a fan of Jim Carrey's wacky brand of comedy. I consider \"Dumb and Dumber\" and \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" to be the funniest movies of all-time, and can watch them over and over without fail. However, I had always been skeptical about his ability to pull off a really dramatic role. Sure, he was decent in \"The Majestic\" and \"The Truman Show\", but in my mind he would always be typecast as that goofy guy with the impossibly stretchy face and crazy voice accents. That all changed after viewing \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\".Though trying to give a brief plot description of this film is like trying to determine what \"Alice in Wonderland\" was really all about, the basic premise centers on the two characters of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). When their once-loving relationship begins to fail miserably, both opt to partake in a new scientific procedure in which all memories of that person are erased from your brain. Clementine completes the operation with no difficult, but Joel has a much harder time letting go, and his journey through his own mind (as he re-lives his relationship with Clem) comprises much of the film.To me, one of the greatest compliments you can give a film (ala Back To The Future) is to not quite know what genre to place it in. Walk into your local video store (or peruse any online source) and you could find this movie in \"Comedy\" (for Carrey's name and subtle touches), \"Romance\" (for the lead relationship), \"Drama\" (for the aching love story), or even \"Action\" (for the incredible visual sequences that director Michel Gondry composes). The only two films I can remember watching that took my breath any at the end are \"Vanilla Sky\" and \"The Sixth Sense\", and this one tops those by a considerable margin.The acting is also fantastic. Remarkably, Carrey makes a strong case that this may be the best role he's ever played (comedy included), while Winslet is every bit his equal in terms of character depth. I could have started the movie right back at the beginning after finishing it and still enjoyed their performances (as well as excellent auxiliary cast that shines in their respective roles).Thus, though I wasn't expecting all that much when pressing the \"Play\" button on this one, it instantly jumped into the top ten films I have ever laid eyes on. PLEASE go out and find this movie somewhere if you consider yourself a movie fan whatsoever. It will absolutely astound you.\n",

      "Usually we're used to think of Jim Carrey as a comedy actor but in this film he shows that he's capable of dramatic roles, as he had done in \"Truman Show\". In this film, he tries to forget a failed romance with the irreverent Clementine (Kate Winslet) through a procedure that is, in practice, a brainwashing. But he regrets that with the process ongoing and tries to find a way to keep his memories. The film seems quite original and, in fact, the script has merit for trying to create a romantic comedy on a premise so different from the normal, but a large part of the plot is highly predictable. Another problem was the dialogues. In a film so light and so romance-oriented why insist on profanity or heavy slang? Some special effects look good, in particular the fading things and the passages from one memory to another at random, allowing us to have a wider knowledge of Joel's past. The soundtrack is quite kitsch and match the taste of both main characters but displeases the ears of the audience. Carrey was perfect in the main character, maintaining a good chemistry with Winslet, who also didn't disappoint. The rest of the cast (where we can see Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst or Tom Wilkinson) do their job satisfactorily, but leaving room for the main actors to shine.\n",

This one is masterfully confusing and sometimes is hard to read into but in the end all the pieces come together in a way that makes you scrambling to remember what happened and if you remember right. I can definitely see why some people would not like it especially since some might have wanted a Jim Carrey movie. There was one hick however, now that I look back on it, there was a slap on side story about another love story that honestly was not up to part and i would have liked it not to tarnish this masterpiece. Though, I just skipped over it and almost forgot about watching that part since I was so occupied trying to make sense of this brilliant \"mindfuck\" as they say. I would give it a 9.5 if I could but i think it is more deserving of a 10 than a 9.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a difficult movie to describe. Probably because it's unlike any movie I've seen before. It's almost like a romantic version of Inception (but without all the suicide). The movie takes place inside Jim Carrey's characters mind and takes the audience through a series of non-chronological flashbacks to fully explain the complicated relationship between Jim Carrey's Joel and Kate Winslet's Clementine. The plot, without spoiling it, is like something out of a science fiction movie but instead set in modern time and with very realistic, grounded characters - one of the many reasons why this works so well. The characters are entertaining, but at the same time delicate and real. Jim Carrey gives a great performance (one of the best I've seen from him), but it is Kate Winslet who really takes the cake. Her acting in this movie is fantastic - probably the best I've seen from her. The supporting cast consists of Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst; each of which fit into the story very well (they all appear in present time, and not in the Jim Carrey's mind or the flashbacks), and each plays their own important part to the story, subtly adding something unique in their own right.In some ways this isn't the type of movie I often watch. It is described as a drama, romance, comedy and fantasy by IMDb, and succeeds as all but one of those. As a romance, it is effective - greatly relying on the undeniable chemistry between Carrey and Winslet; it is poignant but touching. As a drama, it works from start to finish, even when a lot of the drama is focusing the secondary characters, and not Carrey or Winslet (one very effective reveal with Kirsten Dunst's character you'll never see coming). As a fantasy, in it's own weird way, it also works: the plot, again without spoiling anything, involves going into peoples minds and attempting to delete memories (see the similarities with Inception now?), and has the dazzling originality that many modern movies lack. But it is only as a comedy that it slightly falls down. I giggled a grand total of twice throughout the movie, because ultimately the rest of the comedy fell flat. Writer Charlie Kaufman clearly put a lot of work into the characters and story (and did an excellent job there), but evidently put little work into the uninspired humour that accompanies the movie. It probably would have worked better if all the comedy was simply wiped from the script.But putting that aside there is nothing more to criticise. The third act and especially the climax is mesmerising and perhaps even genius; the plot is clever and more than anything original; the cast is spot-on and the acting is great. This is undoubtedly an extremely weird movie, but whether or you like it or not, it is certainly unforgettable; and if you like it, you'll probably love it.\n",

      "I had the pleasure of watching eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and it made me wish Jim Carrey did more roles like this, because it is quite fantastic.This time around Charlie Kaufman makes to think about memories and dreams. The way dreams work and the precious idea that is a memory. Of course this leads to some very dramatic moments where it works, it will affect everyone differently which is something special.The camera work and the dream sequences are fantastic, the script by Kaufman is my favorite of his and the performances are hilarious and rather human.Overall, this is a shining gem of 2004 and cannot recommend it enough.\n",

      "Netflix, I love thee. Most notably, for giving me the opportunity for re-watching an old (depends on perspective) classic. I had the privilege to watch this transcendent flick during my childhood. My na√Øve brain could not comprehend the intricate complexities of relationships upon first viewing. But, after a young adulthood of getting to know myself compared to the relative darkness of conscientiousness, I now see this movie for what it is worth. In my own way, at the very least.My first two \"serious\" relationships give me a canvas upon which to give this movie a 'more serious review.' First, a young mind will not give this movie true thought. Only a mind grievanced with pain has the fortitude to wholly comprehend this film, which both highlights true pain and visual gratuity in such stunning detail as to make the 'human experience' something able to be transcribed by cinema. Whether I have the mind to comprehend this film is subjective. But, suffice it to say, I can understand the emotional depth this movie attempts to portray. We are all weak. In my limited scope as critic and as human, I have come with this realization. So sorry, for the hyperbole. But, the depth of this masterpiece is not fully appreciated until such a truth is realized. Humanity is recognition of weakness. And, this film recognizes this sentience in the mode of human relationships. We are all weak. We are all¬Ö",

Albeit in method of lifestyle or pure, scientific observation (as is the summation that can be derived by the two main character's lifestyles). Yet, this movie does nothing more than to portray characters that give human perspectives on an age-old enigma. 'Is life about finding someone else that gives meaning to our own?' Who can possibly know? But, this film entertains this question with such precision as to allow escapism from one's own romantic ambiguities, and transpose these problems into the lives of two fictional characters with one specific problem --- memory loss.This problem, despite the depth of human emotion conveyed in the rest of the film, serves to drive the plot on its own accord. Memory is a collection of our past livelihood. All the experiences that have been arranged in such a way, serve to be a foundation of ourselves as a present entity. What this movie proposes is a radical change in perspective. What if the very building blocks of ourselves as a person have been rearranged? What if a scientific objective became manifest and allowed memory deletion? Can you, troubled human, have the willfulness to erase an albeit important part of your life in order to mitigate pain? If so, what consequence does this pose? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind proposes such a question in a visually stunning way as to captivate both heart and mind for an entrancing ninety minutes. In the end, it will make you ask, \"Is pain worth the memory?\"And, the answer may surprise you.I am absolutely baffled by the genius that lies in the fabric of this cinema masterpiece. A 'must-see' before you die.\n",

      "An all time favourite of mine. While not incredibly gripping from the beginning, once it picks up it really pulls you in. The dream sequences and internal struggle of Joel were very interesting and real, despite being so surreal. Performances of all actors was superb, especially that of Jim Carrey who may surprise you with his ability to play more reserved, shy characters opposed to loud and impulsive ones. One problem I have with this film is the open ending, which is hit or miss. You will either love this film or be left confused, I would wholeheartedly recommend!\n",

      "The film opens as the shy, soft-spoken Joel Barish and the unrestrained free-spirit Clementine Kruczynski begin a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk, New York to Rockville Centre. They are almost immediately drawn to each other despite their different personalities, though both had felt the need to travel to Montauk that day. Although they do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are, in fact, former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a fight, Clementine had hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all of her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this from his friends Rob and Carrie, Joel was devastated and decided to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps.\n",

      "Even though this is labeled as a review, it really is not. (tangent) However, if you read any of my \"reviews\" you can easily see they are not reviews at all. Rather impressions and images which have pushed me in a different direction or helped clear up some of lives major issues. So, no this is not a review. Just a few thoughts on a great film and more importantly how it fit into this short life.So, onward. Randomly at the Library late last night I found one of my old treasured films, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Now, I have a quick moment and I am going to write about it...well, quickly.First, a great film. Exploring life, love, loss, love again, forgiveness, qorkey people and some realities of life (even though this is very much fantasy and within one own mind). A bit confusing at first, and you will need to watch it a second time through to fully understand its greatness. In fact, this was the fourth time I've watched it and I made new connections. At its heart it is a love story, between two very very human individuals. Each with their own flaws, each with their own...well...personality. And that is where it goes beyond a typical film; at the films heart there are real characters and real relationships. I challenge you to go through the film and not point at one of the characters and say they remind you of someone, or a moment/situation that reminds you of one of lives situations. Great on its own.The second part is how it fit into my life. I watched this film for the first time with my girlfriend at the time, I loved it, she hated it. Regardless, that memory is there. Moving on, freshmen year of college comes along and I finally bought it on DVD. Again, watched it with someone amazing. She asked to borrow it, and well, that was the last time I saw the DVD or her :/Haha...so, maybe a sad story. But I am able to remember the people and the relationships very clearly. And, unlike the character of Joel I do not want those memories erased; regardless of the heart ache I felt at various times. In fact, as crazy as it is, I spoke with the person today which took it for the first time in a couple years.It is amazing how much we can remember. And more importantly how much clearer we see it with five-six years of experience on us.Clementine: \"This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon.\" Joel: \"I know.\" Clementine: \"What do we do?\" Joel: \"Enjoy it.\"\n",

      "ESOTSM is one of good movies made by Charlie Kaufman. I should say Kaufman is one of my favorites. The storyline idea and originality which he made was rare.One thing i admire from Kaufman is that he never feels complacent. Time to time he shows non trepidation works and its hard to find something insipid. His works is immutable and ameliorate drama genre. Maybe some people see him as a dogmatic because he likes to play in his own sole world, but it was benevolent to create non prosaic drama. Kaufman rule the apex level of drama perseverely. If you seek for elites, this director is in peer.ESOTSM is one of most beautifully made drama. Early, Kaufman using scenes to establishing characters life and milieu. Wake up shots, train shots, and beach shots, it gives a very potent impact to the portrayal of Carrey. It relegates storyline into more charming. In the mid duration, this is the problem of misconception of love begin. This is one of story shape that only exist a few in the history. In the late duration, its all about regression and retribution. Kaufman using deep intimacy fantasy shots to grow affection to two leads (Carrey and Winslet). Sink scene, bed scene, and the last sinking house scene were core examples.Character development is a benevolent aspect to Kaufman. He likes to play with characters, digging their minds, giving mental illness, lacking of happiness, feeling deep sorrow, such things like that. He likes to do these with his own inheritance style, and his inheritance is about giving bond and affection to his lead characters. So in the end, he can choose whatever ending he wants to his leads but still inhibit strong dramatic story. Impairing the consciousness of audience and erupting sentiment.\n",

But that doesn't mean that the viewer won't be asked a lot of questions about what is happening. There is a time where you will fill confused because that is how the main character feels and that's how you should feel.While Joel is erasing the memories of Clementine, he remembers the good times that he has had with Clementine and there is a point that he want's to stop erasing the memories and it's this point where the love of these two characters distinguished the most.

      "This movie combines how we feel with how we think. I love how Charlie Kaufman can add real human emotion into a film without making it boring. People nowadays seem to think that you need action or a huge conflictive story in order to make a great film; false. Kaufman proves time and again, that all you need is a fantastic story to make a wonderful, beautiful, and thought provoking film. If you have a chance to watch this movie, I highly recommend that you seize that opportunity. After watching this film, you will want to cry out of joy and sadness. I'm tired of watching movies that are just made without proper care. In my opinion, I believe that films need love, realness, and beauty. This film has all three.\n",

      "By now, Michel Gondry has managed to establish a sub-genre of fantasy films with his use of practical effects. Watching a Gondry movie almost always means that you're going to be transported in a child's fantasy. It tries to detach itself from reality and makes the most out of the medium.But his practical production approach doesn't always guarantee a success. Be Kind Rewind, for example. So what is it that makes Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind a great film? Charlie Kaufman. Bless the soul of the academy members who voted for him. Remember also that Kaufman's well crafted screenplay won't be such a help if the casting of the film sucked. So props to the casting department as well for getting the perfect actors.This movie is very balanced. It's light and deep, funny and dramatic. It's just simply both entertaining and inspiring. And it's definitely a classic.\n",

Its a bit weird to see Jim Carrey playing a shy and quite guy, but he nailed it! The story is well made and the movie just gets more and more interesting the more you watch it! This movie is now one of my favorite films and I highly recommend seeing this. It might be a little hard to understand for younger audience and grownups to, but watch it again and your mind might not be as blown and confused as the first time you saw it! Again great movie and a must watch for any movie lovers or enthusiasts or if you like good movies with a little extra.\n",

      "What's teenage movie about? Yes, it's always about love, break-up, love again, and friendship. Seems boring, but love itself is endless. Let me give the border for \"love\" in this review. It's not about love that I usually write in my other review. Just love from man and woman for her/his couple. As simple as that, the way modern teenage know it too well. Contemporary love we can call it, and contemporary movies we often watched it about this kind of love. So, what's so special about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)? It is the unusual but still romantic idea about love. A science-fiction indeed, not about alien, computer, future, but simply about the way to move one from a man or woman. Ordinary teenage problem, and how this era help teenage to do it. Of course, it has been one decade since it was first released. And technology looks so different even just past 10 years. So, let us just focus on 2004, only cell-phone, and so few of social media. I think the more modern humans are, the harder they will move on, especially for young generation. It's interesting-subject for new-born era of the new-born century.First, let's dig about the very content of this movie. A stressful young man indeed who want to move on. Simple, humble, but there is something more. The fictional way to get it, that's the brilliant idea. I don't want to spoil about how or why, I just want to highlight the point of this teenage problem. Teens always want to be practical, instant, fast, by ignoring the way, and just focus on the results. They don't care how it would happen and the consequences, they just keep blaming, crying, and sad. Yes, it's a part of adolescence though. People gets wiser with it. And the point is the whole young- generation meets high-technology, although it's only fiction, but it's a picture of reality. Again, they don't really know the effect, they even don't really know what they really want. I mean it could be crucial for the next upcoming age, especially for our young-generation. The technology is done carefully, but the usage is not appropriate. I mean it could be no ethics at all in the next information era, when young people can do whatever they want instantly. But, that's the disastrous effect one. That's my thought, a mini-message of this movie, I recommend you to watch it to know what I really mean of those impacts.Go to the story, I adore, what a lovely story. Yes, with some feature of smooth visual-effects, I just can get the whole movie seamlessly. It's not complicated, added with twist, and full of sweet scene. However, what I really love is the touch of surrealism. A movie about dream must be surreal in my opinion. Let's accumulate all those stories of contemporary love, with the science-fiction- seasoning, great acting and cinematography, in the table of surrealism, and what a luscious piece do you really get. I give it nine out of ten, because of its genius and understandable, and it points toward the youth. Very educative, great motion picture of affection.\n",

      "This is in my opinion probably the best movie i've ever seen, it is intriguing, its emotional, i just can watch it endless number of times and always find something new that makes me love it, the scenes in this movie are dream-like, the movie itself feels like a dream as we follow Joel as he goes deep into his memories and realizes that erasing Clementine is a mistake because he's not only erasing the bad things, but also all the good moments they spent together. The dialogs in this movie are also worth remembering, as quoting poems and not wasting even one line in all the movie, making every second of this piece of art relevant and worth your time\n",

      "Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play Joel and Clementine, a couple who, when their relationship goes south, undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories. It's strange, smart, sad, funny, and just overall brilliant.This film left an indelible impression on me the first time I saw it many years ago. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen before, and I was utterly smitten. The material and the way it was translated on screen was appealing in its novelty and eccentricity. Though operating on a far-fetched premise, the film depicts a very real picture of how relationships are - sweet at the beginning, sour over time, and with at least one bitter casualty by the time it ends. What it ultimately asks though, is if it's worth it, taking in all the bad with the good. If the prospect of love is worth the potential disaster it'll leave in its wake. The film doesn't answer it for us, but I'd say the ending wraps up the whole thing in the best way possible.It may be ten years old as of this writing, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind remains to be as fresh, wonderful and unique as ever.\n",

      "I don't know why I hesitated so much before watching this movie, maybe the awful Italian title ('I'll erase you if you leave me') which made it sound to me as if it were a comedy¬Ö",
      " a bad one¬Ö",
      " I don't know.I understand I'm probably the last one to have watched and to comment this title so I feel quite weird... but I can't stop myself from saying that it's one of the finest plays I ever saw. It deserves to be considered a Classic by all means and under any points of view. It tells the essence of many true love stories, probably of most love stories, and in such a wonderful way.I don't see any difference between this screenplay and other archetypal love stories such as 'Romeo and Juliet' or 'Beauty and the Beast'. I guess this movie will inspire many plays to come, as any Classic has done over the centuries.\n",
      "642\n",
      "Simply put, this is one of my favourite films still, 10 years gone.I love how visually fresh, absurdly funny, and unexpected the whole story unfolds for all the characters within. At the time, I would have never imagined Carrey playing a role so straight, nor emotive. Furthermore, visa-versa for Winslet being so lovingly kooky! All this was backed with amazing in-camera visual tricks all but forgotten from much of Hollywood today.With years honing his skills with commercial and music clip production, Gondry certainly locked in a spot on long form autours. If somehow this film escaped your viewing, I'd say give it a go! It is a new classic my opinion.\n",
      "643\n",
      "The ending was great. It shows that no relationship will go perfectly all the way. At one point or another, it will turn sour, you will be bored, you will feel like you don't know her at all. Why is she like this, this is not the person I knew. Truth is, no one is perfect. There is no such thing as a 'spotless mind'. A quote goes like this 'it's not about finding a perfect person, but loving an imperfect person perfectly'. As the relationship goes, you will find a lot of things that you may not like from her. But before you give up and just throw it all away, reminisce the memories you have. You have to feel it, what made you crazy over her? What made you love her so much in the first place? Being with a person is to accept her fully, her good and dark side, any kind of shitty baggage she brings with her. You don't deserve her best if you can't even stand by her in her worst.\n",

      "Great movie! Arguably one of the best movies ever made. It teaches us a valuable lesson on the importance of failing and not giving up if you do. Problem with people is that they are afraid to fail when it comes to relationships. They forget that every relationship has its ups and downs and only stick around when things are looking good. In reality once you you can overcome the downs, you realize how great the relationship actually is. Not to mention the acting. Jim Carey did a brilliant job, completely different style from what he is used to. The movie proved how versatile an actor Jim is. I have watched the movie several times and every time I do, it just blows my mind as to how good it is. http://bit.ly/5greatmovies\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a mind-bending love story about the pain and joys of being in a relationship. Joel Barish (Jim Carey) is devastated when he finds out that his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) has undergone brain surgery to erase him from her memory completely. To get back at her, he undergoes this same surgery only to discover the many joys of their relationship. Through this loss he finds what he had to begin with and begins to fight for his memories of Clementine. This story is a touching tale of all the heartaches of love and that no memory is worth erasing. As the story progresses the audience is taken on a tour of Joel's memories with Clementine as they are being erased giving the audience a full picture of their relationships, including all the fights and all the good memories. Memories are morphed as Joel realizes they are being erased and he begins to control them and fight for them. All the while he is talking to Clementine, discussing the procedure and what went wrong with their relationship and how they can fix it together. This is accompanied by glances into \"reality\" and scenes happening after the procedure, and how Clementine and Joel react to their newly erased brains. And if they will remember each other or move on with their lives. This story is an untraditional love story with a strong message. \"You don't know what you have until its gone\" and for Joel and Clementine, this is most certainly true. Both characters are strong individuals in their own right, Clementine representing a very unique, strong woman with sudden urges that change her life forever, and Joel representing a very spiteful character whom erases Clementine because she did it to him. However along the way, we find that these two are perfect for each other and they fill in each other what the other is lacking. And as the audience, we can only hope that they will find their way back together. This story comes with side stories and twists and villains to allow for extra drama, but in the end it is a true love story. Showing the true pain involved in a relationship, that relationships are not always perfect and we may sometimes want to erase them, but when we remember the good memories, we realize that they are still worth fighting for.\n",

      "'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind' is a love story that differs from the norm. I really like the unique approach of guy falls in love with girl, they fight, breakup, but then the opportunity arises to erase the memory of each other from their mind. The thought of this actually being feasible in real life makes you question your understanding of what is ethical and morally right. I mean imagine some of the consequences of a procedure such as this. Joel and Clementine are the polar opposites of one another; she's impulsive, spontaneous and unstable, whilst he's reserved, quiet, unforthcoming and circumspect. This is what makes their relationship distinctive because she challenges him and makes him do things he wouldn't usually do - she brings him out of his shell. It's not until after erasing most of the memories Joel has of her that he really begins to love and appreciate her as a person, despite her obvious insecurities. I enjoyed seeing this and is what I took away from this movie. Their relationship is not perfect, in fact far from it, but it's through those difficult times that you realize how much you need each other. The idea of erasing memories from the mind is not one I personally condone. The ongoing effects can be harmful to the individual, for example Clementine's spontaneous behaviour with Patrick and Mary's perpetuated attraction to Dr.Mierzwiak. These are the results of recollecting subtle perceptions of the person they erased, which demonstrates that no matter how much you try to forget someone from your mind, there'll always be some fundamental part that prolongs. This movie embodies some really important ideas that can be explored meticulously after the film ends which I really appreciate. It's an engaging, romantic love story that entails a bit of thinking, but a love story none the less.\n",

      "First of all, I'd say that you should have been in love and lost it to understand this movie perfectly and feel it for real. This movie is not a cheap romance. This is deep. It's about real love. About the love that finds itself even without you noticing it or knowing about it. About love that knows no anger or ending. About love that even after the last goodbye, says 'I love you'. Also the acting is perfect. You can really feel the love, and pain, and everything in their eyes. Not to mention that the whole cast is just amazing.This movie is pure love.\n",

      "Jim Carey is a shy man who is more or less accosted by the extraverted Kate Winslet at a beach party. They begin an affair, then split up. Carey visits her at work, behind the counter at Barnes and Noble, but she has no idea who he is.When he learns that she has had her memory of him neurologically erased, he seeks out the clinic that did the number on her and requests the same treatment. If she can forget about him, he can forget about her.So the clinician in charge, Tom Wilkerson, hooks him up to this modernistic looking electronic junk and leaves him in the care of his assistant, Mark Ruffalo, and the receptionist, Kirsten Dunst. Wilkerson goes home to bed, since everything is proceeding normally.Not for long. Although he is unconscious in this metal helmet and electrodes are planted in his scalp, Carey still can think, and after the procedure is underway he changes his mind and doesn't want to forget about Kate Winslet because he still loves her.A conflict ensues within the confines of Carey's skull, causing little glitches to appear. On top of that, Ruffalo is distracted from the monitor by the seductive Dunst, who happens to look very good in her tiny skivvies, and soon the pair are stoned and boogieing around on the very bed on which the tortured Carey is laid out.What follows is an often confusing and disjointed narrative of what's going on inside the head of Jim Carey. There are flashbacks, accelerated motion scenes, total fantasies, and jumbled reconstructions of events from Carey's past. For instance, he wakes up in bed with Winslet, except the bed is isolated on a snowy beach somewhere. The image is imaginative, jarring, and baffling -- all at the same time.Alexander Pope's poem, part of which Dunst quotes to Wilkerson, is apt. It's from \"Eloisa to Abelard\", about two tragic 12th-century lovers who were torn apart from each other and sequestered. Abelard was castrated by Eloise's family. The lines express an envy of vestal virgins who were similarly isolated from the world of Ancient Rome, and who forgot the world outside, just as the world forgot about them. Mr. Leland expressed the same sentiment in \"Citizen Kane,\" \"I can remember everything. That's my curse, young man. It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race: memory.\" I can no longer stand wobbling cameras, instantaneous editing, and other such directorial razzle dazzle, but the tricks here are kept within certain reasonable bounds and the interpolated scenes with Ruffalo and Dunst manage to keep us anchored in the very real present. I didn't get the significance of all of the scenes. I don't know why Carey and Winslet take turns smothering each other with a pillow, both during childhood and during their recent affair. They didn't know each other as children. Maybe it has to do with the unraveling of their relationship -- somehow, each finds the other \"smothering.\" There isn't actually much chemistry between the quiet Carey and the whimsical Winslet. The complementarity theory of marriage has been shown not to work. It's a wonder that each put up with the other for as long as they did.I didn't much care for the minced logic of \"Brazil\" either, but I still get a kick out of \"Being John Malkovitch,\" which this resembles, only without the laughs from the absurd humor. Yet this movie isn't as bad as I'd expected it to be. The romantic element is confounding but at least is aimed at adults.\n",

      "This must be what they mean by when they say Modern Cinema. Movies like this and Inception, Memento, The Matrix, Requiem for a Dream(artistically).... are the movies young people should be watching not Transformers. I saw the movie last night and i just can't stop thinking about it for a moment. It also reminded me of a quote that Christopher Nolan said he based his movie Inception on: death and Nature Illuminate, Elevate. Love ventures under, the rest all never. yes, this movie is about dreams, but the difference is in that, unlike other movies that identify with the above quote, love doesn't necessarily venture under for this one. I read many reviews saying that this movie is very hard to follow especially with its non-chronological way of story telling. Nonetheless, the narrative, for me, wasn't hard to understand and i also thought the order of the story telling actually compliments the movie. The directing was top notch, some might even say perfect. I also loved the editing which helped the film not to lag. As for the acting, i was mesmerized with Kate Winslet but I thought Jim Carrey was even better. It is maybe because seeing him in such a serious role is too weird. It is hard to believe that it is same guy from Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. However, as much as i think this is an almost perfect film, the script somehow trumps them all- it deserved the Oscar.As much as i believe i have understood the hole movie, i still believe it has some deeper meaning and a higher understanding of things, which is why i believe i am gonna see it several times in the years to come.\n",

      "If there was one word I would use to describe Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, it would be visceral. The entire film is loaded with rich and honest detail, in its setting and in its characters and in its emotion. You can look at the characters in their environment and see many things you can relate to, and Gondry succeeded with this intention, because love is something that we can all relate to and it helps make this story more personal.The concept is ambitious, despite it being centered around something we are all familiar with; heartbreak. What if you had your heart broken and you wished that all of those memories would just go away? So you don't have to deal with the unbearable emotional pain that comes with it? Well in this film, such a business exists. Joel (Jim Carrey) signs up to get his memories of Clementine (Kate Winslet) erased because he's far too damaged from the turmoil.The film's narrative is told through a unique structure, which should be no surprise when you find that the brilliant Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay. The movie exists in the present while Joel is enduring his procedure, and in the memories inside his head, which include events that already happened and a lucid Joel who is aware of what is happening inside these memories and tries to run from it with Clementine. These sequences in particular are brilliant because they really capture a dream-like aura to them that are quite appropriate. It's like when you're trying to tell someone something but it's just not getting through to them. Then there's the frustration and the desperation that comes with trying to change something that feels out of your grasp.The bad memories are the ones to go first, the ones we don't hesitate to forget. The arguments and the fighting and the crying, the memories that we don't want to remember when they're associated with such good. It's only when the good memories start being effected that Joel tries desperately to hold onto those. He doesn't want to forget, he just wants to relive them and he wants to stay there forever. So he and Clementine hide in memories where they can't be found to hold onto the love they used to have. Yes, its as touching as it sounds. Kaufman made a smart choice in his screenplay in not completely setting the movie inside Joel's mind. Instead, actors such as Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson, who are the people carrying out the procedure on Joel, are going through their own experiences involving love and heartbreak. This is important because it represents how this kind of love is something that we all go through. It wouldn't make sense for just the main character and his love to be going through it, then it wouldn't seem so real. When you have such skilled actors playing these parts, it does not derail from the story or the excitement in any way, it strengthens it.But the stars of the show here are Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who share a magnetic chemistry. Carrey is shy and vulnerable and introverted, his soft-spoken narration is reflective of his personality. With Clementine, Joel's personality opens up and with her he feels the way he's never felt before. And the emotional journey he goes through as he tries to save his love with her is played quite well by Carrey. Its a wonderful dramatic turn from him that's different from his unique style of comedy he's known for. Kate Winslet is a tour de force, completely disappearing into her character's skin. She gives her charm and enough quirks to make her unique and alive but also very human. All of the actors in this film make it work.All of these things mentioned, along with the outstanding camera work and visuals and locations, even the use of its soundtrack all help craft what is one of the most memorable films to emerge from the 2000s. Its very well crafted and smart and encourages the viewer to think and feel. And what more can those of us who appreciate movies ask for?\n",

      "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mindHow happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd; Alexander Pope, \"Eloisa to Abelard\"A movie made in 2004 about a couple who find themselves hating what they loved about each one. They undergo a medical, or better yet, psychological procedure to erase the memories of the love they felt for each other. Everything goes awry when Joel wants to stop the procedure in his own mind because he finds himself remembering what he loved about Clemetine. Meanwhile, in the outside world, another story unravels and you, the spectator, realize that memories are forming what you are right in this instant. And without them, you would be a different person. You get to think that if the movie was right and you could undergo this procedure, would you go for it? Would you erased what made you cry for weeks or removed that from your life that you would like to forget? Looking for the meaning of Pope's quote some guy on the internet called Robin Patel (correct me if I'm wrong), explained the quote very well and finished it up saying: for one moment try to forget the past and stop worrying about the future.

I honestly felt the emotion the characters did, I was so into the movie even after it ended. And i love how it keeps you going, it never gets boring and just has you to the end of your seat. I recommend anyone and everyone reading this to watch it, it is SO well worth it\n",

      "In an industry (world?) full of average, prosaic, uninteresting and uninspiring people, Charlie Kaufman stands out, a true giant among men. The term \"Genius\" is used so liberally nowadays that it rarely means anything, but in this case, it may actually apply.Marry that with the incredible artistic talent of Michel Gondry and a brilliant cast fronted by Jim Carey and Kate Winslet and what do you get? Well, a masterpiece, obviously, but that's hardly a surprise. You also apparently get a completely out-of-the-world romance that is both cynical and melancholy AND hopeful and joyful at the same time.Make no mistake, this movie is *not* mainstream; it's out there and many people will not be able/ willing to make the leap. Those that do will be rewarded with a rare movie that is beautiful and intelligent and will touch them to the core. Happy viewing!\n",

      "I cannot stand the idea of someone disliking this film, it should be an iconic example of brilliant filmmaking. Michael Gondry (director) and Charlie Kaufman (screenplay) have weaved a remarkable romantic scientific fiction film following a couple who erases each other's memories from their minds. I feel like this is one of the most original movies to have been made in a very long time ‚Äì every element crafted in it has been perfected. You have never seen Jim Carrey shine as much in any other role like he does in this; he plays Joel Barrish, the soft-spoken and emotionally withdrawn man in which the story takes place mainly from his point of view, his mind. Kate Winslet is as beautiful as ever, playing the woman with never ending shades of unnatural hair color ‚Äì she's impulsive, adventurous, and vibrant, whereas Joel is more of an introverted recluse; yet they're in love, and remain in love, despite the choices they both make throughout the story.The writing is incredibly clever. Realistic dialogue and a thought provoking storyline ‚Äì leaves room to question yourself, even. Even if pain follows the good, would you erase all the good just to be rid of the pain? The story is beautiful and the characters could have books written about them, for them. You learn so much about them in such vague shots and a short amount of time, and maybe you don't quite understand why (as Joel and Clementine are quite the odd couple.) you want them to be together so badly, but you just do because they balance each other out in that unexplainable, magical way. The cinematography and lighting provide an insanely surreal feel to the movie; essentially, you are losing yourself in the mind of Joel. It's one of those films where you have to pay attention to understand the little details that make the bigger picture ‚Äì which can be confusing if you've never been properly introduced to Eternal Sunshine. I have seen it about eighteen times and each time I notice things that I never caught before, and it makes my experience even more enjoyable. It is extremely difficult to pick out flaws from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's a rare film that definitely isn't like any other. Everything ties up perfectly; it's a bit of a bitter ending but there's still a sweet, thin coat of hope and happiness to give you the reminder that it's okay to breathe again, that Joel and Clementine will be okay.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a little known science fiction movie of 2004. (I never heard of it until I watched The Simpsons episode \"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind.) In this movie, basically the movie Inception in reverse, a woman erases all her memories of her boyfriend, who decides to do the same thing. However, when deleting his memories, he feels that he's still attracted to her and tries to go back in his memory and stop his mind from being erased. The movie had a very interesting and imaginative story and it was also pretty complicated.The acting was great. I recommend this movie to anyone.My Rating *****/*****\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a romantic science fiction film about an estranged couple who have each other erased from their memories, scripted by Charlie Kaufman and directed by the French director, Michel Gondry. The film uses elements of science fiction, psychological thriller, and nonlinear narration to explore the nature of memory and romantic love.Kaufman and Gondry worked on the story with Pierre Bismuth, a French performance artist. The film stars an ensemble cast starring Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, Jane Adams, and David Cross.The second feature from Gondry finds the filmmaker re-teaming with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman for this off-the-wall romantic comedy. Emotionally withdrawn Joel Barish and unhinged free spirit Clementine Kruczynski strike up a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk, New York. They are drawn to each other on account of their radically different personalities.Although they apparently do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are in fact former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a nasty fight, Clementine hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this, Joel is devastated and decides to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps.Much of the film takes place in Joel's mind. As his memories are erased, Joel finds himself revisiting them in reverse. Upon seeing happier times of his relationship with Clementine from earlier in their relationship, he struggles to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her. Despite his efforts, the memories are slowly erased, with the last memory of Clementine telling him: \"Meet me in Montauk\".In separate but related story arcs occurring during Joel's memory erasure, the employees of Lacuna are revealed to be more than peripheral characters. Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, is dating Clementine while viewing Joel's memories, and copying Joel's moves to seduce her. Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, turns out to have had an affair with Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor who heads the company‚Äîa relationship which she agreed to have erased from her memory when it was discovered by his wife. Once Mary learns this, she quits her job and steals the company's records, then sends them out to all clients of the company.Joel and Clementine come upon their Lacuna records shortly after re- encountering each other on the train. They react with shock and bewilderment, given that they have no clear memory of having known each other, let alone having had a relationship and having had their memories erased. Joel tries to convince Clementine that they can start over, but Clementine states that it could end the same way. Joel accepts this, and they decide to attempt a relationship anyway, starting their life together anew.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a wonderful, often beautiful, and melancholy character study of romance, humanity, and the mind with wonderful acting, incredible surrealism and a funny and heart-wrenching story.It's the kind of film that could mean more to people after they've left the theater and thought about it awhile for it is the perfect movie about love's inevitable imperfections. Aside from that,it entertains for the most part and gives us a set of marvelous performances from this outstanding cast, even if it doesn't quite reach the near-genius of Kaufman's other writings.Indeed,it provides another take on love that would definitely bring out all the weirdness of the premise, sometimes eliciting disbelieving laughter, sometimes taking us to odd, chilly places.\n",

      "I've always found this movie fascinating for a number of reasons, but it's only been recently that I've discovered just what it is that draws me into this crazy story. I think what sold me on this film is the way it straddles and selects themes from many different genres. Overall it seems mostly to be a romantic comedy of sorts, though even this could probably be debated. But while mostly centering on romance with a comedic touch the movie seems to carry a strong message, which it conveys with events that seem to resemble psychological thrillers and maybe even sci-fi at a stretch.Because it uses so many elements of so many genres it is an interesting movie to look at from an analytical standpoint. It brings together many motifs to tell a compelling story that draws upon an entire range of emotions, making it very engaging to watch. Overall I really enjoyed it.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a rare movie with an intelligent script that studies the pain of romantic relationships and breakups. It's quite philosophical and requires thinking. The editing and storytelling styles are unusual which could be challenging to some viewers.In order to understand some of the philosophical ideas behind the script, one needs to be familiar with existentialist philosophy and the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who pioneered existentialist philosophy. Nietzsche believed that pain is essential to human experience. People should not numb their pain. Instead people should use their pain to cultivate their character. He likened the pain to the roots of a plant; the deeper they go, stronger the plant will be. In short, pain builds character.The other concept of Nietszche that stood out to me in the screenplay is the eternal recurrence of events. Nietzsche suggested that events in the universe could be repeating themselves in endless cycle which he called \"eternal recurrence\". Charlie Kaufman probably named the title of the screenplay after this concept. We all know that he knows about Nietzsche as he is quoted a couple of times in the movie (the lines from \"Beyond Good and Evil).The other existentialist concept is the world is what you make of it. It is how you see it and it matters more how you see it than it being an independent reality. If someone erases you from their memory, that doesn't take anything away from the goodness of memories themselves. If they mean so much to you and still a part of you then that's all it matters. Well enough with the philosophy...This is the story of romantic couple, Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey), who go through a breakup. Joel finds out that Clementine had a procedure done to erase all memories of him and their relationship. He decides to go through the same procedure and remove her from his memory. However, during the procedure he comes to a realization. This realization is the wisdom of the movie. It offers a great message inspired by the aforementioned philosophical ideas.I think Eternal Sunshine is a great movie and a rare cinematic art. If you love literature, philosophy and intelligent film-making, the chances are you will like Eternal Sunshine.\n",

      "What's the best part of this astonishingly mesmerizing film? I'd say it's the thorough mastery of the cinematic form. It's every element is blended into a towering achievement of modern movie making, whose seamless integration of story, technique, effects, and performances is truly genius. Charlie Kaufman was already one of my all time favorite screen writers, his Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Human Nature had already so completely entertained me. But Michael Gondry's direction of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (ESOTSM) has set a new lofty standard for all future celluloid captured creativity.Depicting that elusive, mercury slick quality of our thoughts, dreams and memories has long been a major challenge for all film makers. Many have relied somewhat successfully on a deft control of pace, where subtle shifts in timing and rhythm are all that's needed to prompt us to an altered reality. Gondry does this as perfectly as anyone else. Others have been much more blatant and broad, employing such conventions as blurred, hazy images recorded through Vaseline smeared lenses, or even depositing their characters into suddenly severely disproportionate sets, absurdly large or tiny props introduced as a short hand gimmick. Gondry avails himself of these conventional techniques, but only to masterfully exploit them for their comedic impact. And too many other less capable hacks have not even bothered to differentiate the two states, merely having the dreamer wake suddenly, violently, to reveal that the previous experience was all just mental chimera. A cheap, lousy stunt. Yes, Gondry even stoops to this cornball level, and does it so very fluidly, seemingly as a gesture of genuine respect to all the cinematic tactics that have so powerfully informed and shaped our own self illusions and delusions. But Michael Gondry has also fully grasped the value of computer aided graphics in merging both the exterior and interior worlds. The dreamed, imagined, remembered locales and environs are all as \"real\" as any anything else in this film till they suddenly begin to fray, crack and crumble. Rooms and houses are seen to disassemble themselves methodically, randomly, or explosively with utterly natural grace. Like a drunken, drugged fantasy, the whole of the universe unzips and inverts; gravity now repulses and cause precedes effect. It's so deeply disorienting. These meticulously rendered, dizzying episodes are precisely the experience that's needed to convey the frantic, paranoid terror of losing one's memories. It feels as though all computer graphic effects were developed exclusively, expressly for this one exact movie.The script is brilliantly self deprecating, as if continually surprised to find itself actually passing for science fiction. It's an admirable conceit that Charlie has everyone so ambivalent about the fantastical mind erasing procedure till well after things are under way. There's nothing more dizzying than to have everyone not realize just how dizzy you are. It's these subtle, unique expressions of wondrous doubt and confusion that really demand so much of the cast. Jim Carey's subdued, focused performance is often exhilarating, and always exactly on key. His moments as a tiny, not-so tiny, tot version of himself are sublimely hilarious. Kate Winslet, as clever as she is gorgeous, hits so many amazing notes with absolutely pitch perfect skill. And the support crew are all entirely wonderful, with Tom Wilkinson effortlessly animating the beleaguered but arrogant doctor, and Mark Ruffalo so comfortable as a slacker nerd with hip habits. Kirsten Dunst is adorable as his playmate coworker, and Elijah Wood makes post-teen angst feel as sharp and dirty as a rusty nail.This delicate balance of hilarity and poignancy sounds like a fine recipe for old time movie romance, and ESOTSM would have been only that if everything wasn't so expertly orchestrated towards a more sophisticated purpose. Yes, it's true we are cheering for the reunion of our tragically separated hero and heroine, that's the obvious bit. But what elevates and distinguishes this tale is it's insistence on making valid claims to virtue and nobility, much more so than any simple love story ever could. Kaufman and Gondry certainly recognize the value and power that shared affection plays in our daily existence, but they have tied this emotion to an even larger, deeper experience. They have hitched it to our sense of consciousness. What truly interests Charlie is our ability - our necessity - to consider and reflect on just who we are, on who we want to be, and on how we strive be that person. He is hoping to introduce us again to our own sense of destiny. He is a master technician at constructing elaborate devices to capture our imaginations and direct them towards more obscure, rare regions of the psyche. This treacherously seductive machine, this supremely elegant film has carried me to a genuinely higher place. I actually feel enlightened and enlarged and more human for having seen it.\n",

      "\"memories. of the way we were\", isn't that what BaBa Streisand always caterwauled and screeched about? memories are what we are made of. they make us who we are in the present.often memories can be painful and hard to live with and we would just like to forget about them and move on. i have lots of great, happy memories, but i have more than my share of memories where there can be no closure and i would just like to erase them so i can live my life to the fullest. but then again those painful memories have taught me that life is difficult and they've taught me what to be careful of and what works for me and what doesn't. i guess even the painful memories are often good for something as well.tell that to the jerks at Lacuna who like to meddle in people's fate and hearts and play God. i guess my problem with Lacuna is that they make it too easy. without the bad you can't learn about the good.'Eternal Sunshine' is probably one of my all time favorite love stories along with 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Lady and the Tramp'. i know with all the great love stories written throughout current and classical history that's quite a claim.i don't think it's a shallow or superficially trendy claim either. this is a extraordinarily deep and moving emotional experience, and for me personally, a film that holds a very special place in my heart. if you had been through as many painful break ups as i have, you might feel the same way.not only is this film very deep, it's beautifully crafted and well made. Michel Gondry is simply one of my favorite contemporary filmmakers. not only is Gondry a total fantast of the imagination, he is a very sensitive and feeling film director. nobody in this day and age is as original with film effects and photography as Gondry. not even that weenie Tim Burton,who is one of cinema's greatest and most accomplished fantast, is as original as Gondry is with effects.Gondry has also assembled some of the finest performances of the decade. strangely, with all his enormous popularity and fame as a celebrity, Jim Carrey is a somewhat underrated actor. he's given some of the very best performances of recent times in outstanding films like 'Truman Show', 'Man in the Moon', 'Liar Liar' and of course, 'Eternal Sunshine', and yet it doesn't even seem like he's even been considered for Hollywood's most prestigious award, the Oscar. go figure. for a supposedly informed academy, the Academy Awards ALWAYS does stuff like that. that's why i think i prefer the Cannes film festival.the rest of the cast is equally outstanding. Winslet is her usually accomplished self, Wilkinson gives another thoughtful performance, and Kirsten Dunst is incredible and should have been considered for a supporting award her work here.the screenplay by Charles Kaufman and Gondry is heartfelt and sentimental without ever seeming corny or full of clich√©s. if anything, clich√©d is something 'Eternal Sunshine' is definitely not.if you're in love, or just in a relationship, you should watch this film thoughtfully and give it some contemplation. i guarantee if you open your mind to it you will learn and grow through it's experience.perspectives of love and relationships rarely get any better than this. cinema rarely gets better than this. this film is perfect and a \"eternal\" joy to behold.\n",

      "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was just a real joy to watch. The film literally kept me on edge the entire time. It is a rather complex movie, with twists, turns, surprises, and subplots, but they all come together very nicely.Basically, two people are seeing each other, and the breakup is bad. Ever have a really bad breakup, and you wish you had never known the other person? Well, in this movie, it's possible with a revolutionary memory erasing system.To avoid spoilers, I won't go much further, but basically the characters decide, while in the middle of the memory erasing procedure, that he still has feelings for her.Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, and Kirsten Dunts make up an A-list cast, for an A+ movie. It has also been recently released on bluray, so now is the perfect time to give this movie a chance.\n",

      "I love this show. It has, in my opinion one flaw. That is that it appears to the layperson to be a movie with a deep complex meaning that it is trying to get across. The truth, however, is that it is a movie with a very simple and basic message to share, and it does so in a very unique way, which is why it is so easily misunderstood.The simple story is about a guy and a girl who become bored with their relationship, have an argument, and happen to live in a world where one can erase their memories. When Clementine erases Joel from her memory, the pain is too much for Joel to bear and he decides he wants her erased from his memory as well. The unique part of the movie is the way the couple's relationship is told. We see their relationships as memories inside of Joel's dreams as they are being erased. So we are at the same time seeing the past and present, such that the two blend together. During the procedure, Joel quickly passes through the bad memories and as he starts to relive the good ones, the keep being taken from him. This prompts him to change his mind, but unfortunately he is unable to wake up and stop the procedure. He tries to hide with Clementine so he can save a part of her, but the doctors keep catching up to him and in the end he loses. He wakes up the next day with no recollection of who Clementine is or anything. On impulse, however he decides to ditch work and go to the beach where he and Clementine first met. Lo and behold, Clementine is also there. They meet again and fall in love again. But when they get home they find out what they have done by receiving their files from a disgruntled secretary. As they listen to themselves talking about how miserable they were with the other, they almost decide not to give it another chance. But the last moments they decide that they don't care about that.The show's appeal to me is mostly emotional. It is truly tragic to watch as Joel's memories are taken from him. Especially when he wakes up but can't speak to tell them to please stop and as they drug him again all he can do is cry. I'm reminded of Alfred Hitchcock where the guy is paralyzed but they think he is dead and he is forced to lay in a coffin with the impending threat of being buried alive. There is a similar story by Stephen King except the man is forced to sit through his own autopsy. The simple message is that good memories are worth reliving, even if they lead to pain. Pain can be reconciled and worked through. There are other messages one can take from the show, but to me this is the one that resonates with me. I do also love that they end up falling in love again and are subconsciously drawn to places that have special meaning to them both. I don't believe in the theory that there is only one person for everyone (soulmates or whatever) but I do believe that when one finds their match, then there is only one person that can define what love means to you.The other thing about the movie that appeals to me is the very original and unique way of telling the story. The story is the same old love movie yes, but the writing is amazing. The idea very one of a kind. It is the type of movie that you probably need to watch at least twice to really follow, but once you understand that everything is happening in the present, including the memories, then it is easy to following along and enjoy the story.A few more tidbits about the other story lines. That Lacuna company has some serious ethical issues. They have sex while working on clients, inter-office relationships, stealing panties and identities, not to mention the ethical and moral issues brought up by the whole premise of erasing people's memories. Also, Kate Winslet was pretty good lookin in those white gogo boots and that 70's dress. All in all a very entertaining movie. I give it a 10 out of 10.\n",

      "Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup. Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves. At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (\"Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it\"); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.Evren BuyrukThe film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind. He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her. He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active. Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped. His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.The manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences. Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human. The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds. Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.While there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters. As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see. I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause. This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be. If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them. A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been \"Warts And All.\"\n",

      "This particular movie can be described as a sci-fi flick which has it's heart in it's place. A sci-fi movie which does not compromise on the emotional quotient of the movie and makes the audience emotionally attached to the characters. This movie is about Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who decide to erase the memory of each other from their mind so that they can be live a new improved life. The character played by Kate has finished the process of memory erasing and now Jim's character is about to do so. But during this process of step-by-step memory removal, Jim's character gets to love Kate's character all over again in his mind and wants to stop this process immediately. But as destiny would do, both of them with absolutely no idea about their past, meet again and begin to like each other once more .The basic plot of the movie itself is very engaging and enthralling. Jim Carrey who is known to be wild and nasty in his typical movies underplays his part to perfection so much so that in some scenes Kate has out shined him completely (This is even more amazing because Jim is known to steal the entire show in his earlier movies). Kate Winslet for me is the star of the show. She is a livewire on screen with her constant hair color changes from green to red, and from golden to blue. The other cast fit in their roles perfectly. A special mention goes to the editing of the movie especially in those scenes where Jim's memory erasing is taking place. And the director seems to be a fan Of Hindi songs, because in one particular scene, 3-4 old Hindi songs are played in the background .Rating - 8/10\n",

      "When one comes out of first viewing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, it is almost hard to know what to truly think of it. The film takes you on such a bizarre, mind-bending adventure that the first impression is not the one in which really matters. Like many other films from this director, Michel Gondry, it is a film that tends to get better with age.The film's premise is one of the most original I think ever used within a film. The thought that someone could erase specific memories from your mind is at times something any human wishes they could have done. Who wouldn't want to forget a traumatic experience or bad relationship? Still what this film does is make you think about life, love, and memories in a way in which no other film in history has ever made you think.The film was superbly directed by Michel Gondry, who also co-wrote this Oscar winning screenplay with ace screenwriter Charlie Kauffman. I truly believe that this is both filmmakers best works, but the film truly shines thanks to its cast, in particular Jim Carrey, who seems to be playing the only straight man in a comedic story. It is bar none his best dramatic performance to date, and any fan of his work should check this film out.Overall Eternal Sunshine is a totally unique experience that even after a few viewings I still don't know what to truly think of it, but time will tell where this film truly stands.I give Eternal Sunshine a 10 out of 10!\n",

      "'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a film full of unique ideas, characters, situations, and philosophy. It is one of the most alive films I've ever seen. It's a film so full of life and love and graceful quality. It is a film that is as ripe and as fresh as any of the best romantic comedies. It is, at times, incredibly funny. At other times, it's just simply heartbreaking. It doesn't matter if you've been in love or not, because you will get something personal out of this movie.The film basically is about the human desire to want to erase unpleasant memories. In the case of this film, it is Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) who wants to annihilate the horrible memories of his ex-girlfriend, Clemintine(Kate Winslet). The film takes this premise to it's highest potential by placing the viewer in the mind of Joel as his memories are being wiped out. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play their parts as perfectly as any on-screen couple has. While most of their scenes together are harrowing and unpleasant, they are full of truth and clarity. Jim Carrey has that subtle pacing of how to react to things in a nondiscriminatory way while Kate Winslet comes across as more authentic and blunt as she can be without going over-the-top. They both do fantastic. The bulk of the film takes place in Joel's mind, as a matter-of-fact, and while this premise may sound like it is stretching credibility it still manages to achieve that rare feeling of nostalgia, chance, and hopefulness that we all have in our lives. The idea of losing these sorts of memories is a terrifying idea, but Michel Gondry, the director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, knows this and has strategically added a serious flaw in the film, not to make the film weaker, but to make the film funnier. Enter Patrick, Mary, and Stan, three people whose job it is to do the mind erasing. Throughout the course of the film, the character of Joel repeatedly regrets going through with the procedure and tries to escape the brainwashing. This causes these three people who are working on him to encounter technical problems with their equipment and even causes Joel to enter into a waking life state in which he is wide awake but his brain is completely asleep while his mind is being fried. The problem with this is that it is only natural for someone to regret this sort of procedure while it's happening, so these three people should be used to doing this. Michel Gondry knows this and he knows that the audience knows this because he adds in a level of self-parody on top of all the mayhem. This is such a risky think for a director to try and pull off. Add to that the fact that the film is in non-chronological order, the character choice of Clementine getting her brain erased first, and a borderline manic subplot involving a secret love affair between two of the doctors and a love affair with of the doctors and Clementine and you have yourself a very complicated sounding film. If you haven't seen the film yet, what I am telling you will go right over your head. Trust me when I say that this film is a lot easier to swallow than I'm making it sound. All of these elements are developed and played out very carefully and delicately, but not to the point where any of it becomes second nature. This is a real work of art. It is Michel Gondry's masterpiece, no question. The screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, as usual, is beautiful in it's simplicity. Michel Gondry really brought it to life though, and that is something of a miracle. Michel Gondry has the mind of a child. He's so full of life and love and his mind is so open to infinite possibilities. He has taken all of that, and, with the writing of Charlie Kaufman, crafted this beautiful and touching masterpiece of film-making, and I can't thank them enough for making it.\n",

      "A fight against fear, love and shadows. Story of a special desire and ordinary traps. Grey images and gestures in a cold world, after a small miracle.It is the best character of Jim Carrey. The tension, the bones of dream, the colors of Utopian search, the figure of another Orpheus and the final victory are pieces of every man universe, with insignificant elation, angst or desire of self- destruction. The past is the same of every person, as temptation to create another place, time and gestures like pieces of memory. It is a subtle poem about sacrifice and error. Story of an old myth with another words, with same nuances. Story about games, looks and labyrinths, about desire and sense of existence, about lies and trust. About the selfishness and about repentance. About new day and its warmth.\n",

      "From hot screenwriter of the moment, Charlie Kaufman comes this superbly quirky and unique comedy/romance. It's a strange blend of humour and drama with a science fiction premise. Basically after he breaks up with his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet), Joel (Jim Carrey) finds out that he has been erased from her memory by the lacuna corporation. It's a technique that puts patients into a dream as the relive memories of what they want erased and as they relive them they are wiped out. Joel then decides that he wants the procedure because the pain is too much.Kaufmans script is superbly imaginative, if far fetched and combined with the imaginative visual stamp from director Michel Gondry (whose music video background really helps) the film is highly unique. This film also has to be the one that gets Jim Carrey an Oscar nomination. This is by far his best performance it is so subtle and restrained with real pathos that he completely encompasses the character and as such there isn't a hint of Carrey being Carrey. There is no mugging or face pulling of any sort, no flailing of limbs at all. It is a masterful performance of restraint and real accomplishment. Kate Winslet similarly movies away from her image of Kate Winslet as the effervescent Clementine. She is equally superb. She really does portray the quirkiness of Clementine's personality superbly. There is also great support from Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffulo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson. This really is a film that is so far from your typical Hollywood romance that it is immensely enjoyable and simplistic. The plot on occasion near convulsion but it comes clear excellently and the way the beginning links with the end is great stuff. ****1/2\n",

      "***MINOR SPOILERS***Such as Memento, this movie plays backwards. Charlie Kaufman, makes this backwards narrative important, although we don't realize it at the time. As Jim Carrey has his memory erased, he goes back farther toward the beginning of the relationship. This return to innocence is very touching. The brilliant script takes many of the Hollywood romantic notions and breathes new life into them, a very big challenge. There is a unique perspective when we get to see 'flashbacks' of their romance, but we are actually seeing Carrey 'awake' in his memories and trying to change them. There are the heartbreaking moments where Carrey realises all the good memories that are being erased, and wants to stop the process. The visuals are very dreamlike and are fun to watch. Had this story not been thoroughly explored and expertly executed, it would have come off dumb and been ignored.I have noticed very long and impassioned reviews about the romance and how the movie has caused the reviewers to think about their own relationships. This happened to me as well. This comes primarily from the unexpected ending where Carrey and Winslet have exposed their darkest thoughts about each other just as they are falling in love. I think Kaufman might have gotten the idea for this movie by posing this question. \"If you knew that a relationship would have many ugly moments, would you still go through with it?\". It carries a strong emotional impact as they confront the decision.So, in effect, we have a very Hollywood romantic notion that 'love is timeless'. That notion is aided by the excellent acting, especially by Kate Winslet, and the well crafted script. I am sure this script will easily get an Oscar nomination. I give it an 8 out of 10.\n",

There's no denying it had some beautiful shots in there. and the cinematography was 'nice'. but it had that music video feel. I liked the music, but it never ended, we never had silence.

      "I hate to break from the pack, but my wife and I did not enjoy this movie. In fact, we called a couple of friends and told them not to bother. The love story was cute, the acting great, and the plot was clever. TOO clever, actually. We found ourselves asking one another where we were, in which time frame, and asking what the significance was of this and that. Stolen panties, e.g. Never caught that one. Two couples walked out. We wanted to but just couldn't believe we wouldn't miss a wonderful ending that'd make everything make sense. Boy, were we wrong. I wish I could have the memory of this movie erased from my memory, but then, I'd forget how good the popcorn was.\n",

      "(contains spoilers)I expected this movie to be a romantic comedy where two people get their memories of a love affair turned sour erased and then re-discover each other.  While this movie had some elements of that in it, the majority of the movie was taken up in the nightmarish world of Jim Carrey's unconscious mind as his memories of his lover were being erased.The premise of the movie was good, but the setting served to alienate in a way that I'm not sure was intended.  The cold, wet, drab New York-area citiescape and a seedy medical clinic staffed by negligent techies who would get stoned while treating an unconscious patient gave a disturbing overtone that the viewer had to wrestle with.Too much time was spent in the dreamland sequences where Carrey's memory was being eradicated, as he was re-living the events with his lover while the conversations of the techies and the memory erasing preparations were simulataneously going on, both in separate scenes and blended with the memories being re-lived and erased.  In that sense it was an interesting cinemegraphic storytelling technique, although it took a while to realize this is what was happening and not just some nightmare of the unconscious patient.  Those scenes took up too much of the movie.That sci-fi kind of premise was interesting and had a little surprise or two.  But before this movie was over I was thinking how it could have been done differently, for example in a groundhog-day re-living of events and having Carrey stand up for himself against the impulsive and abusive girlfriend (which begged to be done throughout the movie), or some other variation that one could imagine with memory-erasing technology such as one partner having control over what was erased in the other partner, selective memory erasure, or other variations that might be more interesting.Paradoxically Carrey and his girlfriend, in the space of his mind during the all-night erasure session, decide to evade the erasure by 'hiding' in various memories, which provides some entertaining sequences.  But in the end they apparently go back together, at least in dreamland, which gives the lesson that it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.Still, the scenes were confusing, nightmarish and there never was much light at the end of the storeytelling tunnel.  There seemed to be alternate versions of lives that were revisited in the memory erasure process that never made sense.   The 'normal' scenes, the believable workaday life of the clinic, etc. were well-done, technically believable, realistically and well-acted, but this movie had a never-ending darkness to it.  I'm not sure there was one sunny day in the movie (which is how the northeast is, admittedly) but it could have been cheered up or had the nightmare of the memory evasion contrasted with a cleaner, brighter 'real' world, or given a more understandable and happy ending, or made you think more about the possibilities of the technology like Star Trek would have done for example. There was nothing happy in this movie--in the characters, events, setting or the ending.  An interesting acting sidetrack for Carrey as a 'nice guy' but the movie itself was just too interminably unpleasant for no good reason. 3 out of 10.\n",

      "I have seen literally thousands of movies and only walked out of one, (2001 A Space Odyssey) and that is because I one of a group of teens who walked out. Now I didn't walk out on \"Spotless Mind\" but it is the closest I've come to independently walking out. I entered the movie on a false note: there was nothing else to do and I knew I had no interest, and thought the movie was a stinker when I saw the preview. I was painfully right, but I hung in there, hoping for a good laugh. I got one where the older doctor character gave a such a look of total exasperation to the camera, it seemed to express the completely annoying experience of the movie.I felt like jumping through the screen and choking the Kate Winslet character. She seems to justify the bizarre sexual practice of asphyxiation. Jim Carrey, who I think is one of the funniest men on the planet, looks like an AIDS victim here and has had all his comic feathers stripped from him. It seems the only reason he's in this film is because the director told him he could sport his grungy stubble through the film and look like \"an artiste\".The movie navigates like a ship without a rudder. The story and editing look completely improvised.  I tried to exact my revenge on the lemmings in the audience who though this piece of garbage was funny by \"fake laughing\" several times in the movie, in moments when no one laughed.The last time I got this angry at a film was \"Blair Witch\". I just can't believe there are that many people who form an audience for this kind of dreck. And to vote it #44 out of 250 movies on IMDB doesn't give me much hope for intelligent audiences. It took several hours to get this movie out of my system. It was a movie I wish I was programmed to forget.\n",

      "Some movies reject the standard plots for movies and create their own inner workings, which make them perfect for heavy viewer who know the usual plots and can usually predict the whole movie after a few minutes. ESotSM delivers a much needed sense of originality and independence of the standard concepts, from the way the story develops to the refreshingly normal looking actors. Carrey and Winslet actually look like the typical boy or girl next door, hell, Winslet reminded me strongly of a young woman who works in the University. No perfect beauties, no flawless makeup, even the camera and the settings looked and felt realistic.The story itself also has its appeal, which fascinated me for a while. Although modern diagnostic can detect areas of heightened activity while performing specific tasks, it will probably take a few centuries until mankind develops that kind of technique - if it is even possible (suggesting that the brain actually works with memories stored in specific areas ranging all over the brain instead of storing them in the whole neuronal network). But the \"what if\" question is believable enough - and quite interesting. On the one hand, one would certainly feel betrayed if a part of the personality gets stripped away (even if one has decided to do so, afterwards one is a different person and may regret this change). But on the other - and reading the trivia section it's sad that this wasn't included in the movie - what about the really ugly memories. Not regarding a specific person you were in love with until you hated his guts, but the ones that give you nightmares (loosing a fellow soldier or being raped at an early age)? Should one erase those? Or are they a part of the person? Should they be worked out? And what if this is not possible?Although the movie reduced the question to the shallow pains of lost loves (compared to psychological traumatas), it intensifies the conflict in this area. Hmmm, thinking about the time it took me to get over my last love, that technique would have saved me 2 years at least ...All in all a really good movie, but only for a quiet evening. It's no adrenalin flick but one for the mind ...10/10\n",

Not only was it great directing by Charlie Kauffman, it was great cinematography, great editing, and great acting. One of Carrey's and Winslet's best performances yet!  Also, Marc Ruffalo (\"You Can Count on Me\")was a great addition to the movie.

Everything the marketing for \"Eternal Sunshine...\" led me to believe was absolutely wrong, but the reality was a thousand times better.Anyone who has followed Kaufman's work (notably \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\") will recognize his touch at once.  \"Eternal Sunshine,\" however, has a striking difference from the other films.  Though often dark, it is, at heart, optimistic and foremost: it is a love story.\n",

      "A unique thing about Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind is that the movie plot is unoriginal, but apart from that this movie is very depressing. Here we have two main characters \"Joel\" (Jim Carrey) and \"Clementine\" (Kate Winslet) who have a relationship until one day \"Clementine\" doesn't know who the hell \"Joel\" is, we find out that she had a type of brain surgery to remove all memories of him, clearly their relationship is too intense and she wants out, \"Joel\" ends up doing the same thing only for them to meet again and them finding out that the science brain project doesn't actually work, we are forced to look at things from \"Joel's\" point of view as we only see him get the operation or whatever the hell it is and we find out that he doesn't want to go through with it, but it's too late. The special effects are very well- done and clever, but that can't save this wreck of a film.The performances, dialogue and directing is very good, it's the awful plot that is the major problem.By the end of the movie they both listen to each other's tapes and \"Clementine\" tries to depart hastily, \"Joel\" practically begs her to give their relationship another chance, she tells him they would only get fed up of each other and the same thing will happen again, his response is \"okay\", and she also replies with an \"okay\" meaning they are going to give their relationship another go, the final scene is them on the beach together.This cine could have bought a strong message, but instead it ends with a romantic comedy ending which is not where the majority of the movie was actually going.This film would have been a lot better if they'd both have decided not to have anything more to do with each other at the end scene. We see that they're not good for each other hence them both wanting to wipe away memories of one another, also there's the definition of insanity - doing the same things expecting different results, that is the major problem here, they had the mind-erasing operations twice and they're now going to go through the exact same vicious cycle again.The fantasy genre aspect is something that every person has wanted to do at some point (which is wanting to erase a person from their mind whether it's a relationship or friendship) but the reality is God didn't make humans like that, you have to simply get over this or that person, accept that it didn't work out and get on with your life. Science isn't the answer, and it's proved here, this is a pretty childish movie - a person has to wipe away a memory of someone via a scientific machine, oh please! give me a break!, the brain is a powerful thing and if you really want to not think about someone you actually can train your mind to not think about them, it is actually that simple, if only the grown characters had stopped and thought \"thinking about this person causes me pain, so i'm simply not going to think about them\".Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a pointless movie with no decent message, unless however the message is showing the effects of insanity, if the director is going with the message that they're going to end up doing the same thing again, then that's at least one decent thing about this plot.\n",

By then, Joel was an undignified 3 ft tall and Clem was a Southern ho. One viewer spoke of the movie as if an intoxicating poem but whatever he read into it was purely coincidental as this movie did not divulge any such information as to why the couple broke up, for example, although we glimpse an argument where Joel apologizes for a well-deserved comment hurled at Clem. One of the worst parts about it was the fact that the audience knew pathetically little about their apparently 2 year relationship or the threads that weaved their hearts together in the first place nor the cracks their love fell through. And why on earth anyone would want to be soul mates with the impossibly dimwitted, arrogant and offensive Clem is beyond all capacity for understanding.

It seemed very intriguing in the trailer and it's ranked so high on Top 250Ôºåthat I was finally brought into by its hype. What a terrible waste of time and money!!!! Avoid this movie by all means.The beginning was a little boring, but I didn't mind because that's what the fore-mentioned \"great\" movies are, you wouldn't get the plot and enjoyment out of it till the very end. When Joel wanted his memory to be erased, I'm sensing a little excitement and hope this fun ride would last for the rest of the film. And of course, they might add in a twist, such as \"Clem was a split personality created by Joel in his rather boring life\" and whatnot. However, this movie started to focus on the boring fact that Joel tried to protect his memory from being erased, in an extremely mundane manner. Very boring. And what's with the subplot, those technicians making love and swilling during the erasure, it added nothing but length. At about 50 mins into this film, I was already getting edgy, hoping to turn it off. At least add something interesting into it. That's what Butterfly did. First it was plain boring with a series of disjointed scenes, and it started to make sense when Evan traveled back in time. But in this one, just had the disjointed scenes overused!!!!!All the time it was the mysterious disjointed scenes without a clue added to them. As with the ending, I have to say. Worst ending ever! That's even worst because there are great movies with bad endings(ie The Deparetd, Good Will Hunting)but this ending didn't seem like one. It was so out of the blue, and I was left perplexed, where the hell was the conclusion? I've never understood what happened in the end. Did Joel and Clem finally got together or what? I had no interest in it whatsoever, since the storyline itself was very weak and unconvincing. It was like a movie version of Lost, but getting worse watching gradually. Unlike Memento, it left no clue, why all these phony mysteries if no clues attached?In short, this is a bad bad bad bad film. Don't watch it. Don't waste your time and money. If you are watching it for JIM CARRey, watch the Truman Show instead, that will blow this away. Even Titanic is better than this piece of junk.I hope it will sink out of Top 250 one day.

The ending is awfully flat and disheartening after all the different scenes and you can tell the two actors kind of wanted to make it work by playing along.\n",

This movie most probably hits these people with some nostalgia they should probably better let go from a healthy standpoint.

      "Eternal Sunshine is one of the greatest films i've ever seen in my life. its a film that forces you to not only question your past experiences in life but also your past choices. The whole film, from its reversed structure starting at the end of Joel and Clementines relationship, to its use of imagery with Clementines hair among other things, is a spectacle from start to end and an absolute must watch for anybody. if you can watch a film and still discuss it long after the final credits have rolled then its definitely a great film.Jim Carrey was definitely the highlight of the film. His toned down performance as Joel was a really great change of pace compared to his more outlandish roles like in 'The Mask' or 'liar liar'. Although at times you could see his more comedic personality come out like in the baby Joel sequence, which added even more to the whole experience. The sub plot featuring Mary and Howard didn't overstay it's welcome and was a nice addition to the film. In the end it also tied into the rest of the story with all the patients who had their memories erased eventually getting all their files given to them.I can't gush about Eternal sunshine enough. This film was definitely an amazing journey that delivered an amazing message in an easy to digest package, dealing with tough themes and thought provoking subject matter. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of my favourite films of all time and in my opinion one of the greatest films every made. Even after watching it more times than i can count, i still get goosebumps when Clem says \"Meet me in Montauk...\". Please go watch this film, and as Joel puts it, \"Enjoy it.\".\n",

      "The reverse of the classic Philip K. Dick story \"We can remember it for you wholesale\" (aka \"Total Recall\"). Three people, Joel, Clementine, and Mary, are interconnected by the fact that they have all attempted to have painful memories completely erased from their conscious and unconscious memory. The technique is only partially successful. At the end, all 3 remember fragments of their thoughts. The initial device looks just like a beauty parlor hair dryer a la \"The Stepford Wives\". Joel wants to forget Clementine, so he has the procedure performed in the doctor's office and then completed at home. Something goes terribly wrong and he almost can't be \"snapped out of it\" as he remains unconscious for a dangerously long period of time. Thus, the viewer is forced to relive the same imperfectly-erased memories many times and for me this became quite tedious and boring. As expected, Joel and Clementine both tried to erase each other, (she first) and Mary almost forgets her love affair with the married doctor where she is office manager. Good effects, as fences and buildings all dissolve metaphorically as the memories shift and change. Almost like the movie \"Brainstorm\" but not in a toxic or shocking way. I didn't like it at all and I don't care how wonderful and original everyone else thinks this movie is. The only good thing about it is that in spite of all the odds against it, Joel and Clementine finally reconnect and try to start again, possibly indicating that they really belong together after all. It's not worth 108 minutes of my time for just that revelation. As usual, Jim Carrey gives a good off-beat performance but Kate Winslet is wasted as his love interest. A minor \"sexy\" scene as Mary and the technician \"get it on\" at Joel's home and accidentally leave him \"plugged in\" too long, like a bag of burning microwave popcorn!\n",

      "The idea of this movie as you might have read the plot summary, is two lovers adoring each but it eventually turns out to be a failure, they try to forget, it is a struggle, because feelings can never be dismissed, or forsaken. That is the simple message of the movie, and is quite the originality that uniquely classified this movie as one of the best concerning the \"mind-washing\" genre. There is nothing to criticize in this movie, it is a fine piece of work, kudos to all the staff.8/10\n",

      "Possibly one of the ten best movies ever made. Others here have already sung the praises: writing, performances, cinematography. My contribution, in a nutshell: Jim Carrey proves once and for all that there's a real actor -- a world-class actor -- in there. (We got an inkling of that in The Truman Show, but this film sets it in stone forever.) The cinematography does the best job of mimicking a dreamscape I've ever seen. You will believe you're inside the skull of a sleeping person. All of the shots, sets, and locations are flawless; lighting, camera angles, blocking... holy crap! And then there's that story. Ever loved somebody? Ever break up? Somebody finally made a map of your heart. There. Now I can rate it a 10 and move on.\n",

      "To begin in an unorthodox manner, I have to pose you Taylor Swift's question; Was the high worth the pain ? The reason for this is simple, it is one of the hardest questions anyone can be asked, and the answer is not always clear. This also happens to be the primary subject matter of this film.Featuring Jim Carrey in one of his rare serious performances, and Kate Winslet, who we largely get to know through Carrey's memories of her, this film handles that question elegantly. The rawness of the performances by the leads is both a shining monument to their prospective acting abilities, and gives you a sense of realism to their relationship that is seldom found in these types of movies. This is no fairy tale, but instead the story of two people that shows the highs and the lows, the love and the resentment, the connection so many love, followed by the loneliness so many fear. For all it is centered around a philosophical question, the film manages to avoid the pitfall of pretentiousness, and remains emotive and relatable throughout, which is a key feature that most great films possess. By the ending, which is a satisfying climax to the film as a whole, you are left questioning. Is it worth it ? That is the hallmark of a truly great film; not the budget, not the actors, but the sense of engagement you feel during, and the inquisitive questioning you feel after.I would highly recommend this to anyone with an appreciation of love stories in the truest sense of the term.A comfortable 9 out of 10\n",

      "I rarely give out perfect scores on IMDb, out of the 200 or so movies that I've seen and rated, this one is the third that I have given a 10/10. Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind mixes romance with a Being-John-Malkovitch-esque quirky sort of feel. It's original plot provides an unpredictable storyline that ties back into itself, intertwining on an unprecedented level. Before seeing this movie, I would have laughed at the notion of Jim Carrey playing anything less than a slapstick comedy role, and it genuinely surprised me how perfect for this movie he was. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind still provokes thought within me even years after watching it. The depth involved in this movie makes it able to fit all the detail of that of a book, while still being only an hour or two long. Overall, I cannot rate this movie highly enough, and I strongly recommend it to anyone with a thirst for a psychologically captivating film.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004): Dir: Michel Gondry / Cast: Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood: Intriguing comedy about those memories we wish to treasure and those we would rather forget. Jim Carrey romances Kate Winslet but when she has her memories of him erased he decides to have the same procedure done only he may not want her erased at all so he attempts to hide her image within other memories. Visually stunning and a more unique romantic agenda than usual. Stylish directing by Michel Gondry with unique visual appeal as memories overlap. Jim Carrey is sympathetic as he goes from abrupt closure to a fear of losing what he initially loved to begin with. Kate Winslet with a punk like appeal completes the chemistry realizing what she was willing to lose is what she will ultimately fight to obtain. Tom Wilkinson heads the clinic and will be called upon when complications arise with Carrey's memories, but certain facts surface that haunt him. Kirsten Dunst works at the clinic and falls into a romance until she learns certain facts that lead her to realize why she is at the clinic to begin with. Elijah Wood is featured as someone whom seems to replace Carrey and fill in where he had once been although his attempts prove frustrating. Original and solid analysis about memories while regretting those times that brought no sunshine. Score: 10 / 10\n",

      "What makes this film so amazing is not only the adorable chemistry between Kate and Jim, but also the brilliant plot. A film about two people having each other erased from their memories through a fictional procedure might sound stupid and overcomplicated. But in truth, it is bloody genius! Usually when making a romantic film directors follow the same recipe every time. You start with two young and attractive people who fall high over heel for each other after their first date. Then you add 20 minutes of the perfect relationship where their love blossoms like never before. Then a big fight and lots of drama over just some silly thing and every thing seems to go wrong, but then just before the movie ends the two of them find their way back to each other and live happily ever after. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind totally scraps this recipe and instead relay on a extremely creative story. And the result is perfection. Neither does the film have the stereotypical cast like in most romantic films, and don't misunderstand me, Kate Winslet is a beautiful woman! But her role in this film is maybe not her most \"sexy\" one, as she is mostly dressed in baggy pants and hoodies with cheaply colored hair. It is also incredibly fun to see Jim Carrey in this film, as he is not exactly known for being a sex symbol.I believe this film to be a peace of art and I love seeing Jim and Kate on screen together, portraying two people different as night and day. And the sub plot with Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo's characters works just as perfectly. There is not to many characters to keep track of and all of them are given their own personality (Elijah Wood's one being extremely annoying). Though I must say it is not a film to watch with one eye closed, as it craves a lot of attention if you want to know what is actually going on.Truly one of my favorites films.\n",

      "The story is very touching. It opens up subtly soft with the ending, and then builds its base conflict straight up. The details reveal themselves very neatly afterward, and the turning point and main conflict is then presented in a very touching yet somehow funny and cheerful way of story telling. I like how this movie even has spare time to develop a side conflict between the supporting characters. The main conflict and the side conflict both serve neatly designed twists that are quite unpredictable up until the very moment they're about to arrive. The acting is very nice. I love seeing Jim Carey doing something other than comedy, although he still doesn't leave his funny-man aura. Kate Winslet gets into the carefree and careless Clem very nicely. The appearance of Mark Ruffalo, Kristen Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson made this movie more alive especially with those extra twists.\n",

      "One of my all-time favorite movies. Seeing Jim Carrey in a more serious role was a new change of pace. His and Kate's connection was almost too real. I felt like I was actually standing in the background, watching from afar in some scenes. Even after a dozen times watching, I'm still brought to tears by the story line. Especially the scene where Joel is crying and begging, \"Please let me keep this memory, just this one.\" It was truly heartbreaking.Every time I watch this, I find a way to connect with one of the characters. Whether it's with what they are saying or thinking, or just the way they react. I haven't found many films that I can say that about. This movie is definitely worth your time.\n",

      "Translated to \"The Awakening Of The Mind\" in my country, Sunshine is an homage to the beauty of love, but also its ugly side. Combined with a scientific feel, the movie delivers a funny and witty love story that makes some rather important questions that are mainly associated with moral and ethical dilemmas. The plot revolves around a man that chooses to have his former partner erased from his mind, after finding out that she did the same procedure. The leads are played wonderfully by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who show off their acting skill by playing characters not usually associated with their type of roles. The direction and co-screenplay by Michel Gondry is a visual and quirky feast for the eyes and will suck you in right from the start. The supporting performances are also very pleasant, as they deliver what we ask of them. A very beautiful film and a true awakening from the complications of life, Eternal Sunshine nails the mark.Rating 8/10\n",

      "Great acting, original plot line, makes you feel, ideas for contemplating life. Is it possible to rate a movie without leaving a review? I wouldn't even be leaving this review, but I can't find another way to leave a rating. I need to write the minimum of ten lines. This seems really silly. Can anyone tell me another way to leave a rating without having to write a review? If you can't leave a rating without leaving a review, doesn't this seem silly? It will just cause people with nothing to say about a movie to write a bunch of nonsense. I guess this is still not ten lines of text. I think the best way to judge a movie is if it makes you feel something strongly. This movie makes me feel.\n",

      "This film is a complete mind bender! I had not seen anything about it really apart from the poster. I Didn't see the trailer or read the synopsis before watching the movie. I just decided to see it because it had Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet in it.I had been told it was not a comedy so knew not to expect Jim Carrey's over the top comedy acting that we all expect from his work. But when I started watching this I felt sorry for him... he plays a depressed man really well. He had problems and seemed so lonely. So at this point I thought I was watching a movie about a guy with personal problems meeting a woman and their lives together trying to cope with his depression... I was wrong!Imagine my surprise when all of a sudden memories are being erased from their minds thanks to a company that can help you lose all the bad painful memories in your life.I won't give too much away just in case you want to see it, but trust me when I say that this movie is all over the place. One minute you are with Jim and he is sad because his relationship is not going well and loses his partner (Winslet) and he goes to get his memory erased to get rid of the pain, the next minute you are seeing him happy with Kate during happier times, but during these times things around them are fading and blanking out.There is another side of the story which involves the staff at the company that erases the memories. This fits well in the movie and ties nicely up at the end of the film.Jim Carrey plays the part really well and I now see him as a good actor as well as someone as you can just laugh at when he is over the top . He has proved he can calm things down and play a serious role. I feel Kate Winslet did a good job too, but didn't shine as much as Jim did on screen.The supporting cast also has some famous names in there too including Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood who play employees of the company.Final mark I personally give this movie is: 6 out of 10.But whatever you do, do not watch this film unless you can sit down and watch it from beginning to end. If you are not concentrating on it or catch it from the middle of the movie, you will struggle to understand it.For more reviews check out my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204\n",

      "Highly recommended. The brilliance of the movie lies in the way the emotions of the two main protagonists are dealt with. Jim Carey as 'Joel' is his role of a lifetime and 'Clementine' played by Kate Winslet complements him perfectly. As the memories are being erased, the way 'Joel' realizes how much he loves 'Clem' is apparent with the fear of losing her that can be seen in his eyes and by his actions. 'Clem's' character has been played brilliantly by Kate Winslet whose acting skills have always been out of this world. How she pulls of those vivid hairstyles and tops are a mystery in itself. The locations have been selected with great care and go hand in hand with all the scenes that are being shot. This movie has all the flavors of emotions' present in it. Its a unique experience in itself. This movie is not only meant for the people who understand love or have been in love, its meant for anybody who loves 'good cinema'. A must watch!\n",

      "This is perhaps my favorite movie of the last decade. It is certainly in my top 5. Written by Charlie Kaufman, and directed with by the wildly imaginative Michel Gondry, I was lucky enough to see this movie at the theater during the summer of 04'. The timing couldn't have been any better for me personally, as i had gone through a horrific divorce 2 years prior, and had just moved to California to be with my new girlfriend. This is the kind of romantic movie that even guys will hold very near and dear to their hearts. The movie presents us with 2 flawed characters who have broken up, Clementine gets her memories of the relationship erased, and when Joel finds out about this, he opts to undergo the same treatment. The movie presents the memories of their relationship in reverse order starting with their bitter and angry break-up,(during which both of them say things that the audience can tell they don't mean) and ending with their initial meeting on the beach. The memory scenes inside Joel's head are all shot with beautiful cinematography, the images are haunting & iconic. Gondry uses his signature camera tricks to great effect, and manages to create a fully realized world of disappearing memories. The movies main storyline runs along simultaneously with the story of married Dr. Mierzwiak(Wilkinson)& his inappropriate relationship with his secretary(Dunst) which takes place in the real world during the events taking place inside Joel's mind. The movies only flaws are in this secondary plot line, which attempts to point out ( rather heavy handedly) how unethical such a procedure is, and how it would only leave the recipient with a sense of being raped and robbed of a piece of ones identity. It all seems forced and obvious, as if all of the writer and directors efforts went into telling the story of Joel and Clementine, and the rest of the story was just kind of thrown together halfheartedly.Or maybe its just that we, as the viewer are so drawn to the story of the main characters, that we just fail to care at all about the extraneous story. Dunst and Wilkinson, (to their credit)play their parts with skill and nuance, she is so obviously in love with him, and wants desperately to gain his affection. While he wants to avoid her, and keep from possibly doing more damage to his marriage. Dunst and Wilkinson's relationship only serves to underline the same points that are made by the main storyline of Carey and Winslet's characters. That being that a person may remove their memories, but the soul that has been touched by those memories, cannot be changed. Love cannot be forgotten or erased, because it is fated, because it is too precious to us, it becomes an indelible part of the fabric of our selves. we are forever changed by it, and without those memories, as beautiful and horrible as they may be, our soul's will know that something big is missing.\n",

      "how do i describe this movie... i was skeptical at first. i didn't expect it to be that good because most romantic-type movies are cute, sad,or twilight(what a disaster that was) but this one had a twist i would have never seen coming. It's sort of science fiction, and the farther you get in the movie the order of events in his mind change which was so cool, that really blew my mind. Im still a little confused about the ending I'm going to have to re-watch it, but man oh man this movie was good. Also i liked the fact that they were both a bit weird, they weren't the typical office workers who find each other when the quirky girl drops her paper work in front his cubicle non-sense. i think if you want to mix it up you should definitely choose this movie. :)\n",

Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are so lame, the first one we used to watch goofing himself and Kate is just not that good actress at all, especially in this movie. I hated this movie from beginning to the very end and everything about it! And why is rating so high, usually I agree with all IMDb ratings, but this one is wrong. I think that this movie is similar to another f*** up Carrey movie \"Number 23\" and \"Lost in Translation\" which is most boring movie of all times (and this one is second).

      "\"What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.\"Would you want to erase your most painful experiences from your memory, if you could? Heartbreaks, disappointments, regrets, all gone over the course of a night? Is there any value in memories from a failed relationship?Feel free to come to your own answers about all that, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has it's own POV to share. After the relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) comes to a messy end, she decides to have it all deleted from her mind at a clinic that specializes in that sort of thing. Upon finding out that he's essentially been erased, Joel opts to have the same procedure done. As he's lying comatose, trapped in his own disappearing memories of the woman that, for a time, he loved, he starts to wonder if he has made the right decision. Maybe some memories of Clementine are worth holding on to.¬†I like this movie. It's smart, it's thoughtful, it's inventive, it's harsh, and it's touching. The cinematography is beautiful, and all the little transitions and visual flourishes that happen as Joel loses his memories are pretty cool. Winslet is as great as always, Carrey pulls off an excellent, understated (for him) performance, and a bevy of solid supporting actors are present in the side-stories that compliment the primary tale of Joel and Clementine.My personal favorite thing about the movie was seeing a relationship in reverse, from ending to beginning. You see the cracks shrink and smooth over, but the seeds were there from the very start. Is it worth it to try again, armed with the both the knowledge of what to avoid, and the knowledge that history may inevitably repeat itself? I don't know. But, I do know that this movie is well worth the hour and forty-eight minutes it takes to watch it. Recommended.\n",

      "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!I'm no poet, nor do I normally favor it over other mediums. But this snippet of Alexander Pope's poem is as mesmerizing as the excellently written movie it takes its name from. If only I could write a story with such great intentions, romance, suspense, comedy and heart.I truly loved this movie. I love the fact that it starts in normal Jim Carrey fare ‚Äì Goofy with a touch of romance, but sooner than you think, you're drawn into a science fiction story of a mind-erasing clinic for love-lost humans. And by the time you think you've discovered all the movie is about, it splashes the whole picture across your face and it tricks you. You've been watching an incredibly deep and romantic picture all along.Talk about one of the all-time best written screenplays. It even dupes me each time, though since I enjoy it so much, I allow it to twist and turn me until I've been eternally satisfied all over again. So much so, after each viewing, I just sit back with wide-eyed amazement and in complete awe of the creators of this movie.The scenery is beautiful, the soundtrack and score wonderful and the performances by the leads ‚Äì Carrey, Ruffalo and Wilkinson are great while Winslet is perfect. Again, along with the story, you think she's some kook ‚Äì I would, if I met her in real life, but the depths of both her character, Clementine and the performer, herself, gives me shivers. Thinking small, you will call her a great actress. As a whole, she will surely go down as one of the greatest actresses of all time. Heck, I even liked her in Titanic, but following that movie, she's blown me away each and every time making her \"Rose\" character in the big boat movie look like a High School play.Despite not giving away a synopsis of the movie, I feel like I've given away far too much. Suffice to say, if you like a great movie with depth deeper than the abyss all wrapped up in a movie that screams independent, watch this movie. It's one of the few movies that not only makes you want to press stop at the end and re-play from beginning. In fact, you will. I did.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an eccentric film brought by eccentric film makers, who wanted to revolutionize the look (literally)and quality of romantic films. Gondry and Kaufman's film collaboration is phenomenal. It's a film that started a new era of film making in this clich√©d genre, setting aside every other film of 2004 and undeniably making it the best.A distinct film that has its plot about a couple, who are having a detour in their relationship and now want a permanent erasure from each others' memory so they can finally move on. A plot that sounded easy at first, but the succeeding events seemed not to be easy atall,especially for Joel Parish played perfectly by Jim Carrey.I really think this is Jim's best performance to date. His character as an actor is expedient for the role that it felt believable, having said that this is actually an \"almost fiction\" film. As I said this film is full packed of people who are eccentric that make Eternal Sunshine a film that shines brighter than any other. Make no mistake; he's great (Jim Carrey) in this film, but not to dominate Kate Winslet's performance as well.Kate Winslet playing Clementine Krucynzki , the other half of Joel in the wreck headed relationship is the first the one to do the memory erasure procedure. After months to their relationship, she realizes that it reached the point of dullness and that they can't survive living together anymore. Kate Winslet is just alluring, easy and at times lovable to watch. She can do any role and can give the exact justice for it.Filling the great casts are Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson who are all portraying to be a team of people responsible for erasing a certain person's memory towards another.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a train ride type of film. You just seat and look out for the next station, in which metaphorically means your personal expectation. You need to watch out what happened at all. Why do they even need such a procedure in the first place? And why sometimes we feel \"a love that is fresh is a love that seems perfect\".It's a film that realistically reminds us of the idealism and pragmatism of romance, relationship and most of all, Love. But for me, I simply describe the film's essence as the song by Beck describes it, \"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometimes\".It's definitely one of the best films of the decade if not the best.\n",

      "Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an eccentric, thought-provoking love-story that explores the relationships we form with others in our memories, and the age old philosophical question of whether true love can prevail over the scientific nature of life. The plot derives from an idea captured in a quote from the infamous poet, Alexander Pope.\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;\"\"Sunshine\" sees Joel (Jim Carrey), a socially inept and withdrawn character, and the mysterious, eccentric Clementine (Kate Winslet) falling in love after Joel's spontaneity leads him to a train station in Montauk. But there's a catch, to Clementine something feels a little too familiar about their encounter for it to be real, however Joel puts this feeling aside as an after thought. That is until Joel and Clementine have a deal breaker fight. Desperate to make amends and win the love of his life back, Joel goes in search of Clementine, only to find that Clementine appears to be completely unaware of his existence, let alone aware of their previous long-term relationship together. Introduce Lacuna Inc, a company that specialises in erasing the memories of those who simply cannot live with them. Although such a set-up seems all too predictable, Kaufman merely uses it as a device in order for his audience to access the films message on a deeper, more philosophical level. In an impulsive act, Joel turns to Lacuna Inc, and seeks revenge in the form of erasing the burden of Clementine from his mind forever. \"Technically speaking, the operation is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.\" Joel is assured.However, once the procedure is underway, in the light of increasingly intoxicated Patrick (Elijah Wood) and Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Joel suddenly has doubts about getting rid of Clementine, perhaps it was a step too far. In true non-chronological fashion, Kaufman unravels this twisted science-fiction tale before the audience's eyes, as Joel slowly relives his memories with Clementine over again, he realises that with every memory that passes he's slipping further and further away from Clementine Whilst the books tumble, letters erase and faces fade, Joel begins his desperate struggle against the inevitable erasal of Clementine.Jim Carey is particularly brilliant in his heart-rending performance as withdrawn Joel Barish, successfully demonstrating his versatility as an actor to perhaps speculative critics, after many type-cast him to his Ace Ventura antics. Kate Winslet is particularly excellent in her portrayal of the vibrant free-spirit Clementine, who gives a thoroughly insightful, though-provoking performance. Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst also provide a commendable, performance, as Kaufman lets loose the last trick up his sleeve with his perception of other consequences that could arise from such a procedure. Unbeknown to Mary (Kirsten Dunst), she's had more experience of the Lacuna procedure than she thinks. After an affair between Mary, and Doctor Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), who masterminded the procedure, is uncovered by his bitter wife, Mary consents to the process herself in order to prevent such an affair ever occurring again. However, unforeseen by the Doctor, although Mary's memories of their affair were eradicated, her feelings towards him certainly never faded, so much so that Mary begins to fall for the Doctor all over again. After a fumbled kiss, Doctor Mierzwiak's wife pleads with him to finally reveal the truth to Mary, whom before hadn't ever considered how ugly such a process can really be. Distraught, Mary mails back all the tapes to any patient that has ever had their memory erased by Lacuna Inc; causing untold consequences for those who may be unaware such an event ever occurred, including Joel and Clementine.Although many critics of the film argue that Kaufman's non chronological order is too much of an obvious and repetitive technique, I feel that it's presence within the film is invaluable, as not only does it emphasise Joel's state of confusion, it allows the far deeper message of \"Sunshine\" to seep into our imagination. Joel's inability to prevent Lacuna Inc from forever erasing his entanglement with Clementine could be related to one's own inability to control the acts of everyday fate, with our own higher power acting as Lacuna Inc. \"Sunshine\" is ultimately Kaufman's expression of a deeper, psychological message concerning the human mind itself; how the different relationships we form with others (particularly those whom we cherish) in our minds can completely differ from the relationships that exist in our former life, and how we often glorify the positive memories in favour of neglecting the perhaps more unpleasant ones.\n",

      "An exceptionally interesting, moving and superb performed movie is what Eternal Sunshine provides. An insight on love, but from a different point of view. A movie that very much deserves its spot in the top 250.I highly recommend anyone -who accepts somewhat more alternative movies- (though casting provided Hollywood's most famous) to watch this as it gives you goosebumps, but in the best sense possible. Spoiler: It's definitely got a bit of a 'Vanilla Sky' theme but in a different context.It's truly a breath of fresh air to see Jim Carrey step out of character and show his true talents. Kate Winslet once again shows that she is without doubt the best actress of her generation. Other stars like Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are very able to fill up any backing vocals needed in this song about love.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a movie that discusses the road of love, not the destination, however depressing or sad we know that destination will be. But to choose love for love, not for that destination.Truly a masterpiece, with highest regards to Kate Winslet. 8 out of 10.\n",

      "This was by far the best film I have seen in years for real life romance. Living paycheck to paycheck and trying to find love out there had these two in a whirl. I love the end for the imperfections not getting in the way of their lives together. Even with Clemintine's hair changes and Joel's mood swings these two still rocked in their own special way. Sometimes life is like that. You get kicked out on your doorstep in the cold because there is something for you to learn out there to make you a better person or lead you to better people to suit you. There is an innocence about these two characters that comes through giving you hope that no matter how messed up some people are, there is that special someone for them. I am forever grateful to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet for making this script come to life.\n",

      "This is such a brilliant and beautiful film. Michel Gondry takes Charlie Kaufman's excellent script (I've read it) to the next level ¬ñ using a unique visual and stylistic approach to carry out the story. The performances are spot-on, and the chemistry between Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey (who plays a very different role than he usually does) crackles. At its heart, Eternal Sunshine is a very insightful love story that pulls at the heartstrings; there is a certain lyricism and sensitivity to the story that is hard to find in movies these days ¬ñ and it is that sensitivity that makes the film so alluring. When most other love stories are a matter of life and death, this one is a matter of memory, which relates to the question the film asks: how far will we go to forget the relationships that, upon coming to an end, have hurt us the most? It also happens to be very funny.\n",
      "722\n",
      "The film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, gives the audience a brand-new view of the blended style in representing memories through film-making. Although it seems that the film is made out of order, actually it follows a structure, that is the stream of consciousness. The non-linear representation, the irregularity of narrative, and the subversion of the normal impression of space and time are all vivid embodiment of human's dreams and memories. According to Freud's psychoanalysis theory, \"Dreams are the royal road to the unconscious\". He argues that dreams are wish-fulfillments, and those wishes are the result of repressed or frustrated desires( to him, mainly sexual desires). Dreams can be the deep, profound memories in people's life which they purposely hide behind or intendedly forget with the help of certain medicines. However the question is, can memory be effectively erased, or does it be turned into unconscious? In the movie, when Patrick exposes his feelings to Clementine with the words he steals from Joel, it's very strange that Clementine reacts to it in an uneasy way, it seems that she senses something wrong, that sense can be explained as coming from the unconscious. The major themes in the film are, of course, about love and memory. There is still the big theme in American culture, escapism or flightism. People tend to escape from the reality whenever they confront with difficulties and frustrations. In the movie, we see the characters, Clementine, Joel and Mary, escape from the unfruitful love experiences by erasing all their memories related through medical treatments. Escape does no help in solving problems, but is simply self-deception. When the unhappy memory comes back and presents itself in front of you, it becomes more unbearable and crueler. Mary resigns her position. Out of revenge or responsibility, we can not ascertain, she mails all the clients' records, forcing them to face their obsessing memories. It is interesting that the ending is designed in an open way. The two lovers seem to be ready to reunite, but have they learned any lesson from their previous experiences? Are they going to escape again if they have any problems? There are uncertainty and indeterminacy left behind.\n",

      "My embarrassing confession is that lately I've been having trouble following movies. I was worried for a while that maybe I was becoming dumber, like I couldn't understand great films any more. But maybe it was because I stopped following certain movies because they actually weren't that great, and hence they lost my interest. I say that because two movies I've watched lately, Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) and now Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), both of which are complex movies, actually did manage to hold my attention and I loved both of them.So what's good here? Although the movie is categorized at the local video store as a comedy, I was looking for something heavier- a serious drama- and this hit the spot. There's little funny here; at most it's a drama with some comic relief. The writing is smooth and that's no surprise because it's from Charlie Kaufman, the man behind Adaptation (2002), who with that film and this one, is establishing himself as one of Hollywood's best writers. The acting is good. The storyline is interesting- it's about a couple named Joel and Clementine (played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) growing unhappy with each other, so they go to a special clinic where they can have their memory of each other erased. But during the procedure, Joel soon regrets his decision to erase Clementine and desperately tries to hide her deep in his memories. The way this unfolds is very dream-like, with surreal sequences as things in the memories begin to disappear and blur. This took some imagination and you have to admire it. The movie won an Oscar for writing and probably deserves more recognition. It's a latter day classic.\n",

      "It's now been nearly five years since Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was released. I have commented on quite a few films, and why I never commented on this before is beyond me. The story sees a normal guy who has broken up with his girlfriend. He then finds out she has had some modern medical procedure to remove their relationship and him from her memory. He then decides to kind of get his own back and get it done too. then halfway through his procedure, whilst under a deep sleep, he realises that he still loves her and wants to keep hold of every memory he has of her. its sounds strange, and what do u expect it comes from the mind of Charlie Kauffman. I cannot stress enough how beautiful this movie is. Michel Gondry deserved an Oscar nod for his direction, its out there but suits the tone brilliantly. Jim carrey does an amazing job as Joel, showing he is not the one trick pony many thought. Yes he is great at physical comedy, and has made us laugh out load for the last fourteen years, but he is also a very very brilliant actor, capable of showing true emotion through heartbreaking scenes. Kate Winslet is already known through the film world as being a hugely talented actress. Here is no different, she plays a deep eccentric character, who has an edge. She is terrific. All the supporting players are very good too. Elija Wood, Mark Rufflo, Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst all succeed in their roles, showing that even in background roles they still shine. What I believe to be an important part of this movie is the soundtrack. The haunting piano music for different scenes is fantastic. There are not a lot of films people can call perfect for its genre, the shawshank redemption, the godfather and American beauty maybe. I claim this to be a perfect film. Its upsetting yet uplifting, a very rare breed indeed. Everyone has to see this once, and when you've done that, watch it again. This in my eyes is the greatest film ever made. I'm gonna go now, as I wanna put the DVD on and fall in love all over again\n",

      "How many times, have we as humans wished to forget someone. Maybe an uncorresponding love, a relative who has passed away or a long time girlfriend who is going to study outside the country. Maybe not a person, but a shameful situation, that time you made a fool on stage or when you just couldn't contain a gas any longer. Now imagine that by a medical treatment you would be able to forget, just like that. That is what happens to Joel's (Jim Carey) girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet).When Joel finds out she has decided to forget him, he decides to undertake the same process in order to erase Clementine out of his mind.Joel goes home and goes to sleep, the therapists then come in to apply the treatment. Joel will experience each of his memories involving Clementine in a reverse chronological order, from his last memory until the day he met her. Here we are transported into Joel's mind and at this point is were the expression \"Don't know what you have until its gone\" is applied. Joel finds out he does love CLementine and has now to try to stop a delete process which is no longer under his control.Both of the main performances are genius. Carey proves he can act just as well in a more serious movie. Kate Winslet character is just amazing, I instantly fell in love with her. There is also a side story involving the therapists Kirsnt Dursnt, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson, which deals on the ethical view of doctors, patients and the treatments they use. Michael Gondry's direction is also five stars, with amazing landscape and screenplay. He has proved to be something else than a good music video director. Finally I would like to say this is the type of movie you will enjoy better if your significant other is by your side. Sometimes few bad moments make us forget the great ones we have spent.\n",

      "The teaming of whimsical director Michel Gondry and mind-bending writer Charlie Kaufman was bound to end with the creation of a film that refused to stick to normal cinematic boundaries, but still compelled the viewer. However, Eternal Sunshine went beyond levels of wacky beauty and intellectualism that even the most optimistic viewer would've hoped for.Starring Jim Carrey as Joel Barish, who wants to remove his impulsive ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) from his memory after she did the same to him, it focuses mainly on the importance of memory to humanity, and how beneficial it is to keep even the worst memories. The film is composed mainly of a journey through the psyche of Joel Barish, as he watches as the team of erasers, Lacuna Inc, destroy all his memories However, the main reason for watching is the beautiful, quirky and tumultuous relationship between Carey and Winslet. The chemistry between the two is unmistakable, with Carey leaving his ordinary comedy role to play a timid neurotic who is too nervous to appreciate the joys of life, and Winslet playing up her role as the extrovert girlfriend that awakens Joel's senses.The two main characters play on every emotion that the audience can bear; doing the utmost to ensure that there is no minute of film in which our humanity is not being played like a violin. Each insult they hurl during their relationship hits us hard, each tender moment is felt as deeply. Gondry and Kaufman set up scenes of eccentric beauty throughout, from Carey and Winslet lying on their backs on a frozen lake, to a comically sweet \"baby Joel\" scene. And throughout this, our beliefs on what memory is, and what it does, is poked and prodded, examined whilst we watch and wonder ourselves what our own memory would be like.Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood provide fine support as Lacuna staff with their own intriguing secrets. Wood excels especially, a side plot involving his character falling for Clementine and using Joel's identity to try to win her heart is a fine separation from the main plot, whilst still adding more layers to Clementine as a character.The universe that is created here, where people can be free to run around their own minds, experiencing their lives all over again, is one that simply should not be compressed into under two hours. The audience wants more when the film finishes, more of the elegantly idiosyncratic touches that are deftly moulded into the memory scenes for one, but also more of Joel and Clementine, what is next for them in their relationship. For without their engaging love story at the centre of proceedings, this film will be no more than a series of fanciful but emotionless tricks. With Carey and Winslet pitch-perfectly playing this ambiguous relationship, emotion is one thing that this film certainly isn't lacking.\n",

      "Simpley the best movie ever. From the direction to the acting to the story this film is brilliant. Kate Winslet steals the movie with the greatest performance of all time. I hate and love Clementine and thats what I think thats what the writer wanted to feel about Clementine. Jim Carry also gives a great performance and for some reason Jim Carry and Kate Winslet didn't get the Oscar and that has mad me mad, even though it dosen't matter that they win or not. The co-stars did a great job and worth being notice. To my point of view this screenplay is the best that has ever been written and may stay that way for a long time. The filmaking of this movie is great too and should be like by movie gores. This is only romance story I could relate too even though I haven't found love yet. There's only been two films that have change my life on this level and there are this movie and Fight Club. This is also the movie that got me into the romance movies and have become my favorite movie genre. I can't express how good this movie and the most heartwarming and heart breaking script and story of all time. This is the movie that made want to be a filmmaker for sure in my life. I would recommend this movie too anyone that loves movies and want to see a good movie.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman scripts are tricky things. With all the right other elements in place, they can be great (Adaptation, for example). If not, however, they just don't quite work. Sometimes, a director who can handle his work right (e.g. Spike Jonze) is on board, but the film is miscast (Being John Malkovich - I really thought Diaz and Keener were wrong). Other times, the cast is right, but the director is all wrong (Human Nature). This film falls under the latter. It just felt like the movie never quite came together. We never got too involved with the characters, and the editing, pacing, and direction didn't let them develop at all. I thought it was a very interesting idea, and I thought the actors did fine jobs, but the movie wasn't what it could have been.\n",

      "I went into this knowing a few vague things about this story, and a recommendation from my sister. I like Jim Carey when he does something different, and this is definitely different. And I adore Kate Winslet.But even beyond the actors, I wasn't disappointed at all. It's a fabulous film, as long as you don't mind a slight mind-bending experience that really makes you think. The idea that you can just wipe your memory is intriguing, and Elijah Wood's character is pleasantly creepy. The interplay between reality and memory, both created and real, is quite well-done. It's a fascinating film, if you're willing to wrap your mind around it. And the ending, while ambiguous, works quite well.\n",

      "Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) has just discovered his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) went to some company to have her memory of him erased. He's so devastated that he goes to that very company to have the same procedure done. During the process of erasing his memories of her, he realizes he still loves her and tries to stop the procedure.Jim Carrey, playing against type, gives his best performance to date. He shows his funny side but proves he can also be a good dramatic actor. Kate Winslet is nothing short of wonderful. She glows as the eccentric Clementine. The supporting actors all do very well, even when they're given little to do. The script by Kaufman is second to none. He pens a classic and beautiful love story in the most original and interesting way. No wonder he got the Oscar. Michel Gondry's direction is weird, to say the least, but it is imaginative and inventive.I think the message of this film is that no matter how many faults your partner may have, you can't help but love them for who they are. It's a message mostly everyone can relate to. And the actors and filmmakers make it memorable along the way. Satisfyingly Sweet!\n",

      "This movie is wonderful in so many ways it cannot be explained. The acting, the story and the way it has been told are so original and refreshing that it makes you want to learn the entire movie by heart. The two main characters of the movie represent, for me, the excellent archetypes of the modern day man and women. A man that is cold and closed in his world, unable to communicate with other people and isolated in his gray life of getting to work, working and going back home and an impulsive and sensitive women that is always looking for ways to live her life to the fullest extend, fall in love to each other. The problems that happen later start happening simply because of this differences and the relationship suddenly ends when Clementine impulsively decides to erase Joel from her memory. What Joel then does is the begging of the movie. He is unable to cope with the fact that someone he loves has completely erased him from his life and decides to do the same. But during the procedure of erasing he suddenly realizes that those memories are to important to him, that he really wants to continue loving Clementine and that he needs to start fighting for the love he haves. A the end the couple get together again but this time aware that relationships are something you need to fight for in order to work and that life will never get perfect. I think this movie will become a true classic.\n",

      "WOW. what a movie - this one of my favorite movies of all time, and if there was a perfect movie, in my mind, this is it. This is why:There are movies like the recently released 300 that are low-brow but entertaining purely for their visceral delights - they hold your attention, amaze you, but they offer nothing to think about. Accepting them for what they are, they have their own merits. While they are empty - all fat and calories and no nutrients - I will continue to watch these \"blockbuster\" popcorn movies on opening night.Then there are the intellectual movies, so absorbed by themselves that they loose their audience. They set out with the goal of enlightening you, changing you - but they have the tendency to be tasteless and bland. The worst one that comes to mind being \"Waking Life\". This one actually tried to be eye-candy, but it bored me to tears. The philosophical musings themselves were interesting but basically it was a college lecture in CG graphics. Sophomoric at best, I would have watched Die Hard instead if I had the choice. It lost me at about 25 minutes in...and the theory, thoughts, and the message went through one ear and out the other...The best movies in my mind transcend themselves and become experiences. They leave you with something, you learn from them, you think about them, they influence how you think about yourself and how you see the world. However, they also fulfill what a movie is supposed to do - entertain. Eternal Sunshine did this - and left me with something new, something I could think about and bring into my life, and at the same time, it held me, entertained me. That is a rare achievement in my mind.Make no mistake, Eteranal is a movie that demands your full attention. Even so, it warrants a second and third viewing to fully grasp the beauty of this film. The jumps in the story can disorient and I can see how some will be put off by this. However, if you watch carefully and are able to understand this you will realize the beauty and craft behind the mixed pieces scattered throughout the film.I haven't seen a movie that captures the feeling of a \"dream\" like Eternal. You will see the absurd, and the surreal...and yet it in your gut it makes sense - just like dreaming. Needless to say, what you will see will arrest you. The direction alone is a masterpiece - the scenes are loaded with creativity, and there are times where you will go \"how the hell did they shoot that?\". Gondry should have won an Oscar for this.Finally, I have looked at a lot of the discussion around this film, and while the central themes remain the same, what people have taken away from the film seems to vary - there are different levels to the film beyond the visceral, which is already amazing in and of itself. The tone of Eternal is melancholic, however IMO it's message is very positive. Eternal's message to me is this...when you try to forget the pain, be it a person or an experience, you forget all the good that came with it.Go watch this movie!\n",

      "Eternal Sunhine of the spotless mind is one of my favorite movies, It's some of the few movies were actually everything was excellent. One of the (If not THE) best direction work I've ever seen, a lot of symbolisms and well put scenes, the complexity of the work makes the movie a little bit bizarre but that just makes you appreciate more the quality of work we see. I was completely surprise by Jim Carey's acting, I actually didn't knew he can act, but this movie states he can not only act but excel in this field, maybe if he would have dedicated to this kind of movies he would be in the same place as Johnny Depp or even Eduard Norton. Kate Whinslet always great!! the secondary characters (Elijah Wood, Kristen Dunst...) were also very good. The photography is awesome. The Script was a really incredible piece of writing, if I was too say the 2 best things of these movie, the script and the direction will definitively be my decisions. this one is one of the few Incredibly good movies that we can see now, A TRULY PIECE OF ART. 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!\n",

Michel Gondry's excellent technique of serving the breath taking scenes of this film is totally astounding. There are times when I desire to beam my self up into the enchanting scenes of the film, there are also times which forced me to miss some scenes due to my inner evaluations of my past relationships. Be prepared to go blank sometimes. You may need to rewind some scenes because of self-criticism. Those who are prejudiced against Jim Carrey, will experience a great shock while watching this gifted gentleman. And Kate Winslet is mesmerizing with her performance. The soundtrack and the lighting of this masterpiece is also flawless. Supporting players like Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst have shown a great performance.

Please believe in feelings and destinies, and your sun will shine again soon. I wish I could tell you the secrets of love, but I don't have a clue.

I don't think anything comes close to this. It's one on it's own. To those who say it's too high in the top 250, I say it's way better than the 'Godfather'.

The most original love story i have ever seen, not like the predictable, love stories, with traditional plots, this is creativity at its best. The imagery, the acting, the directing, everything in this movie is great. The only problem with it is that you have to wait t'ill you get almost in the middle of the movie, because it is kind of complicated, but once you start feeling it, you will agree with me that this is an excellent movie.

One day, the letter, which says: \"we erased Clementine's memories about you, so we would like you not to tell her the memories about you.\" He also goes to the same doctor's to ask him to erase his memories about her, But during the procedure, he realizes that he still loves her and doesn't want to lose her. So he struggles...The pictures are very beautiful and it has an interesting plot and a good twist. Jim Carrey usually acts a funny and humorous person, but in this film, he acts a quiet and boring guy. Also he looks different like cool and chic, so I think it has novelty. In my opinion, this film teaches us that we want to forget about someone who hurts us, but it will be probably more important to forgive them.\n",

Jim Carrey along with Kate Winslet and the rest of the cast, did a great job in this movie, and not only could i not tear myself away from it, I found that I my face was mimicking any emotions that were being displayed throughout the entire movie.

Trust me, if you miss anything in this movie, it is hard to catch up to what is happening. The effects in the movie were also great,I very much enjoyed the way they put this whole thing together.

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is an excellent romantic and intriguing comedy-drama about two people who don't truly realize they are in love until one loses the other. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is a lonely yet sweet man who is looking for true love and the ideal woman. His search ends when he meets Clementine Krucynksi (Kate Winslet), an energetic and wild young woman. Clementine is everything Joel isn't... at least not the Joel the world sees. The feelings locked up inside of him are released through Clementine. They prove you do not have to make love or kiss all the time to be in love. This couple can play music, in the snow, go shopping, or just lounge around at home and the audience can tell they are in love. But as time goes by, their relationship begins to shatter and really goes to the extreme when Joel discovers Clementine erased him from her mind, thanks to a brilliant doctor's invention. Joel contacts the agency, Lacuna Inc., and its main doctor, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), for Joel to receive the same operation. During the evening Dr. Mierzwiak and his team: another doctor/technician (Mark Ruffalo), a lovestruck receptionist/assistant (Kirsten Dunst), and a naive twentysomething (Elijah Wood)perform the operation, Joel evaluates his relationship with Clementine and realizes he is still in love with her and wishes to keep the memories of her.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is an incredible film and one of the greatest modern romantic comedies of our time. It is smart, clever, and charming with an exceptional cast and an intelligent crew. This movie received many excellent reviews and anyone that I've known that has seen it agrees. This movie is unique and makes the audience think and comprehend of what is happening. A movie like that is superb. You also get to see the gentle and serious side of Jim Carrey and the wild and funny side of Kate Winslet, what you would think would be vice versa. The supporting cast consisting of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson is does a great job. Charlie Kaufman, as always, writes a phenomenal script with such creativity and intellect. Speaking of intellect, director Michel Gondry uses his own intellect to make this film a spectacle. The shots are captivating and exhilarating. It is just a shame that a film with such an amazing story, performances, and film-making did not receive many Academy Awards or awards similar. This film was overlooked and should be appreciated. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a romantic motion picture unlike any other. It is definitely not one of those typical romantic comedies when they both love each other without realizing it, blah blah blah. This film captures beauty and the true quality of a great film. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, perhaps of all time, and anyone else who has will agree.\n",

      "This is one of the best movies ever..it's just so touching and i find it quite helpful..i mean it helps ppl to see how important relationships and especially the memories in the ppl we love or loved are for us.J.C and K.W are just great in this movie,they really make u believe it is a real story even though it's a s.f one...i know ppl that didn't understand what the movie was about so they didn't really liked it but i think that it's just because maybe it is a hard movie to watch just like vanilla sky where u don't watch the movie for 1 sec u kind of get lost in the action and u just don't understand what is happening...i do not really agree whit ppl that say it is a romantic comedy...it's more like a drama..but..whateva'..all that matters it's just that it is a great movie\n",

      "The movie is fantastic, so the actors are. It is very refreshing to see Jim Carey playing a part like this. When I met him for an interview a few years ago, he told me that he would love to be not only the funny guy. We all know this is difficult, because once you played some funny characters, the people and the producer wants to see you staying in that. This brilliant movie proves his all-round abilities. I am happy for him.This is one of the very few movies that successfully brings action and drama together with a good love story. It has also very well dosed slightly funny and sarcastic peaks that prevents this movie from getting too heavy. Every couple an therapist should watch this. :)\n",

      "I first watched this movie in October 2004. My relationship of over 4 years had just ended a few weeks prior, so this film couldn't of come at a worse time, or better time. I could relate to every word, and every scene. One of the first thoughts i had when my relationship ended, was wishing i could erase every memory of her from my mind to stop the pain. Few films today are successful at touching the viewer emotionally, and if anything, this one does TOO good of a job. So i commend the cast and crew of this film for their excellent work. Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Michel Gondry, Charlie Kaufman, Jon Brion, Ellen Kuras, and the amazing editing job by Valdis Oskarsdottir.I recently watched this along with Kaufmans's Being John Malkovich as a double header. Two films that remind me that originality in films is still possible.\n",

      "This movie is excellent in my humble opinion; It's that kind of movie you can see over and over again, and always there's something new for the eye, something that you didn't get before.The plot is really amazing and unexpected, and the whole mind game stays with you for weeks. It's a little bit confusing at the beginning, but half an hour into the movie things start to get explained and, by the end, the whole movie fits like a glove.Eternal Sunshine is a deeply moving picture and a brilliantly executed drama, without falling into clich√©s. I think all the issues of relationships are treated within the movie, and you will feel very close to the characters.I highly recommend this film to anyone that has been ever into a relationship that has ended for some reason.\n",

      "There is a quote from Nietzsche's Zarathustra, something along the lines of, when you say yes to one joy, you say yes to all woe. There is a moment, half way through the erasure process for Joel, when he cries out to the doctor erasing his memory, \"Please let me keep this memory, just this one.\" With that, Joel is essentially accepting the entire course and swoop of his love for Clemmentine; not just her confession that she feared being ugly, or her tangerine sweater, or even her crotch, but her changeability, her alcohol consumption; even the painful end of the affair, all for one memory. And at the end, despite his having forgotten everything about her, and despite knowing from her that the relationship is going to fail, Joel says yes one more time.This is a wonderful movie. I had resisted seeing it because of Jim Carrey; for the same reason I avoid Robin Williams in serious roles, when I see them acting drama, they always look like the improv is busting to get out. Here, though, Carrey never gives a hint that he is about to go all Ace Ventura on us. Instead, he gives a restrained, effective performance as Joel. Winslet as Clemmentine is likewise fine.But the real stars are the direction and the screenplay. The movie creates an unnerving feel throughout, especially in the memory sequences, with quick cutting and effectively unsteady camera work. The screenplay is intelligent and witty, and makes effective use of the non-linear story - we may be jumping around but we are never really lost.Well, except maybe once; the circular nature of the story - it begins more or less at the end - came as a nice surprise to me. But it is honest, the clues are there - the differences in the \"meet\" story Joel tells, Elijah Woods's unexplained presence at Clemmentine's building, Joel's not knowing My Darling Clemmentine.... A nice job by the screenplay.By the way, on a couple occasions, characters sing My Darling Clemmentine. Note that both times, they stop just before the line, \"You are lost and gone forever/Dreadful sorry Clemmentine.\" Not as long as we have memory she's not.One of the best films I have seen in years. It will live in my memory... I think.\n",

      "brilliant....brilliant...brilliant....the plot is very good, very original...a very nice, emotional story...it could seem a little weird, in the beginning, but it turns out just a brilliant story as you go and understand everything, so if you're watching it don't stop in the middle of it cause you are f---ed up and seem to not understand anything, you will... basic plot: Joel finds out that Clementine, his girlfriend erased him from her memory and decides to do the same...but during the process he starts regretting losing all the good moments he had with her and tries to stop the process and stop losing her... the person who had the idea for this movie should be honored as a genius, as it evolved from the an message like \"-nickname erased you from his memory\" (wich you can get on e-mail, or messenger or other programs of that sort) into a brilliant story about love, about life, about regret...just simply brilliant movie, brilliant story, brilliant acting.... \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" a movie worth seeing...\n",

      "I haven't read any reviews for the movie but I am sure mine will sound the same. Wow. Jim Carrey was excellent and so was Kate Winslet. Jim Carrey has really showed what he started to in the Truman Show that he can play non comedic roles. Not only can he play them but he is great. Along with that the concept in this movie is great. Who wouldn't want to be able to erase some memories or a person from their memory. However, this is not the reason this movie is such a hit. Condry moves in and out of Joels memories telling a story of both Joel(Carrey) and Clementine's(Winslet) relationship and the reasons that have led them to erase each other. What really gets the movie going is when Joel decides not to erase Clementine and the interesting events that unfold. While skipping from Joel's memories while he sleeps to what is going on around him all the characters stories tie together. I do not want to reveal anything a preview will not but I do want anyone who has not seen this movie know that you are 100% missing out on a good movie experience that has many interesting events and does not follow the typical Hollywood form of the money making movies today. This is a story that makes you feel for Joel and Clementine almost like you are involved in the whole thing. I watch this movie a lot. Which says a lot as I have about 250 movies on DVD and another 60 on tape(and these are movies I like not just any movie I see) . I typically don't watch movies to often but this one grips you. So if you haven't seen this movie take a 5 minute trip to blockbuster, best buy, or wherever and rent/buy this movie.\n",

      "This move is amazing. It is a story of love and heartbreak. It really defies the science fiction or speculative fiction genre. If you enjoy movies of romance/science fiction/ and high morals, Eternal sunshine is for you! The movie centers around Joel Barish who just broke up with his girlfriend Clementine. Clementine has gotten a procedure done by a company called Lacuna to erase all of his memories, meanwhile Joel decides to get the brain procedure done as well. The story is so different and interesting, it also has a background mini story with the workers of Lacuna who play a role in the turn of events. Seen as confusing by many the story takes you from the beginning and back to the beginning.If you think you will enjoy this movie please don't hesitate and give it a try. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a heartwarming movie and will leave you satisfied in the end. Beautifully captured, give it a try!\n",

      "Yeah, what can be said about Charlie Kaufman's and Michel Gondry's masterpiece? Well, it is just so wonderfully directed and written and at the same time so terrifyingly romantic that every real film lover will enjoy it! Here's the plot: Joel Barrish (just fabulous: Jim Carrey) is facing a bad crisis: It's Valentine's Day 2004 and he dooms this day because it was \"invented by greeting card companies to make people feel like crap.\" He's alone. Not long ago we was happy with a nice girl - but he doesn't know that anymore! This girl, Clementine (Kate Winslet at her very best), has had Joel erased from her memory and because of that, Joel has done the same to her. (What a great idea is that?!) But when Joel meets Clementine again on this Valentine's Day both have to realize, that true love cannot just be erased... Again, we get such an imaginative and completely original screenplay by genius Kaufman, but this time he brings in his very emotional and romantic side, making Jim Carrey something like his \"alter ego\" and Kate Winslet the crazy kind of girl he (perhaps) always wanted to meet. Michel Gondry is Kaufman's fantastic partner in the project for \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" and shows what can be done with Kaufman's beautiful scripts. His directing is completely addicted to the beauty of love and the depression coming along with it. He can also do this because of his amazing actors Carrey and Winslet, who also seem to have fallen into this world of deep emotions and chaos. But also the minor characters do excellent jobs. Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Mierzwiak, Mark Ruffalo as Stan and even Elijah Wood as Patrick and Kirsten Dunst as Mary in very self-ironic roles are absolutely satisfying. All in all, there is no doubt about the fact, that \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is one of the best romantic movies in the younger past. But that's not all: Also the great cinematography, the beautiful soundtrack and of course the excellent cast make it a modern silent masterpiece, combining virtuosity with deep emotions.\n",

      "The thing that surprised me the most about this film is that it was made in Hollywood. This is an absolutely beautiful film. This is the sort of film that Hollywood should make more regularly, but I know films like this don't make a lot of money. To see both Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet play against their usual characters, and pull it off with skill, heart & determination is also a very pleasant surprise, as well. Many of my friends didn't even recognize Jim Carrey until well into the film. This is a true testament not only to both these actors, but to the direction of Michel Gondry. It is obvious that he does not compromise when he makes a film (or if I might be so bold as to say \"a piece of art\"). The final surprise and another pleasant one, is that, much as in life, this movie does not have a happy ending. In fact, Gondry trusts the intelligence level of his audience enough to leave the ending open and allow the viewer to extrapolate as to what will happen next. Kudos to the Hollywood production company and/or the producers who let the ending stand.\n",

      "I didn't see this movie for years because I thought it would be something like 50 First Dates (which I found dull). Far from it. Like Being John Malkovich - I think - Eternal Sunshine... revolves around the existential notion of the self-creating individual. What comes to mind is the story \"Metamorphosis\" by Kafka, where a man finds himself transformed into a cockroach one day and finds how his life or he himself turns out to be totally inadequate. The story plays upon the \"what if..\" - things would be so great if I were somebody else, what if I were John Malkovich, or if a part of me I don't like could be erased, like in Eternal Sunshine... Existentialism holds that it's ridiculous to think you could be somebody else, as there would be no you anymore. The self-responsible, self-creating individual cannot take shortcuts without failure, as we can see in the case of Joel, who chooses to delete all of his memories of a past girlfriend, only to find that he really needs them. Most of this movie takes place in his mind. Like \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation,\" \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" feels like a European movie shot in Hollywood. It's just a great movie, with extremely good, natural performances (Kate Winslet rightfully received her Oscar nomination for this role). Just go and check the Awards and Nominations list. This is romantic, and a comedy, and food for thought at the same time. You'll find yourself coming back.\n",

      "Finally Carey has shown the actor he had inside!! The rest of the cast is also brilliant, even Elijah wood doesn't recall he was in lord of the rings. The music is awesome, the filming and photography amazing, it's a shame I didn't know about this movie before. It's one of those movies you can't figure out the hole plot from the beginning, and I think that is very good nowadays where movie writers don't seem to find any new stories. I recommend to watch it without reading anything about it. The plot will surprise you, make you laugh and think. The only thing I found quite weird but acceptable for plot purposes is that with such high-tech machines that can erase your memory, people are still using tapes for audio recording.\n",

      "Wow, where should i begin? This movie is one of those films which makes you question your life, your existence. If seen with the one you love it makes you wanna just embrace her/him and never let go. it is a story of true twisted and unusual love involving two complete opposites yet we end up with a perfect match. I know this sounds lame, but Gondry and Kaufman made something thats so over the top that is almost the undeniable definition of movie making.Kate Winslet, one of the most talented actresses ever, is again marvelous yet with a role that is very unlikely of her previous ones. Jim Carrey once again proves that he can do some serious acting along with his comedy influence at hold. I guess it would only be fair to say that Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey have switched roles for this once. Kate Winslet as Clementime Kruczynski draws a portrait of a sensational impulsive girl while Jim Carrey as Joel Barrish is a timid young man looking basically for companionship.Charlie Kaufman is the clear explication of what talent is, not only with e.s but also with his other screenplays.(e.g being john malkovich, adaptation) He grasps the audience by heart and gives them the experience of a lifetime Congrats, two thumbs up(if not less)\n",

Needless to say, I was completely blown away. I had never really seen Jim Carey in anything except his movies like dumb and dumber and i thought he surprised me with his performance here. I was expecting just another love movie but trust me, it's much more than that. It's story is complicated and overall good. The ending was a little sad, but i like that it didn't have a clich√© Hollywood ending were everyone lives happily ever after, without giving it away the ending is open to interpretation. So in conclusion GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!\n",

      "This movie was simply fabulous. There's no other word for it. I loved Jim Carrey in the Truman Show, thought he was robbed in that case as well. But this movie was just so beautiful, and moving, and thought-provoking. What would you do if you could erase someone from your memory? From all aspects of your life? Would you do it? Should you do it? Jim Carrey played the seemingly straight man to Kate Winslet's zaney Clementine. And yet, they were such a great compliment to each other. In a way, you begin to see that perhaps she dyes her hair such wild colors to cover up her insecurities. And Jim Carrey is a quiet soul, with a lot of energy behind it that Clementine brings out.I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending is rather a surprise, and you don't end up where you thought you would. The entire movie is shot beautifully, and just thinking about the creativity behind it, gives me chills. It's such an awesome concept, and if you loved this, you'll really love Adaptation, by the same makers.The supporting cast is great as well, with the exception of Elijah Wood who seemed very misplaced and lost in the film. But watch this, and see what a great actor Jim Carrey can be when he's not in knee-slapper comedies. I love him in those as well, but it's a sham that the critical acclaim seems to always pass him by.One of my favorites!\n",

      "Originally when viewing the trailer for Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind, I thought it looked like an okay movie. It looked like something I wouldn't enjoy, and to be completely honest, I thought a little less of it knowing that Jim Carrey was to be playing such a serious role. Now, almost a year later, I sat down in front of my television and nearly hit myself for not watching it sooner.ESOTSM was one of the most amazing movies I have seen in awhile. It had an original story line, unlike most of the movies you see these days. From the moment it started, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Every single part of this movie, including the parts that made me want to cry, were done beautifully. There are memorable moments where the words just stick with you long after the movie is done, and scenes where you feel as though you are living through Joel or Clemetine's pain.Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey did such justice to their characters, saying each line as if it wasn't scripted at all. If not said already, I think this was their best movies yet, for all the cast and crew alike. I cannot stress enough how completely wrong I was about Jim Carrey's work in this movie, he really blew me away!If you don't enjoy this movie for it's amazing story line, or the amazing job done by the cast, you will definitely notice the poetry of each word said. One scene in which Kirsten Dunst's character Mary is reciting lines from Alexander Pope's poem \"Eloisa to Abelard\" had me hooked. I've never enjoyed a script as much as this one.All in all, I highly suggest this movie to anyone who has the time to sit down for 2hours. I don't think you'll be disappointed!\n",

Even if you're single and never dated you can learn almost all about the relationships between a man and a woman the good, the bad, and the ugly in this film.. Watch it now before you watch King Kong even. Ace Ventura ( Jim Carey) Rocks and so does Mary Jane (kristen Dunst?) from spider man. The names aren't important what is important is that the show is decent budget, but down to earth, gritty yet abstract and all the time exceptionally real. It is in my top ten movies of all time and also is a safe film for the children although they will probably not grasp the theme, therefore not get the movie and just be oblivious, I recommend this film for everyone, however if I had to force an age group I'd say 15-30 years of age.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind How does one describe a film such as this? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind exudes a far different feel than pretty much any other movie in the history of film. Strictly speaking, it is a romantic drama, but there are so very many more layers to it than that. Eternal Sunshine is refreshingly surreal and weird, and yet at the same time painfully realistic and honest. This may sound like a contradiction - one of the film's points is that life is full of them. Director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman have masterfully succeeded at creating a completely unique world in which to tell their wonderful story. Being that almost the whole movie is told in the mind of Joel (Jim Carrey), and is essentially a dream of sorts, Gondry and Kaufman have concluded that many dreamlike occurrences may occur. It's sometimes hard to follow the storyline, since the story is being constantly barreled abruptly in the opposite direction, with us as the audience being taken into areas we have never seen before. But this never comes across as a problem; instead we only become more intrigued by this surrealistic storytelling, and more interested in watching the relationship of Joel and Clementine unfold in reverse. But, uniquely bizarre storytelling fashion aside, at the heart of the story is a genuine and painfully honest love story. We connect to the characters of Joel and Clementine in such a deep manner which is simply lost in modern fiction. Never once in the movie do we interpret Joel and Clementine as fictional characters - these are real people, and this is a genuine love story unfolding its complex beauty in front of us. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet each give career defining performances, and capture our hearts like no other mere \"characters\" before. The supporting cast are equally note perfect, when given their moments to shine. Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood each manage to astound us in turn, and there is not a single character in the film who we as an audience fail to relate with and sympathize for. These are frighteningly real people, interacting in a very genuine fashion. Yet the movie really belongs to Joel and Clementine, and Carrey and Winslet whisk us through, dreamlike, and never fail to astound and delight us. I think it's safe to say that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the best and most unique films ever made - it boasts easily the best script of its year and one of the best ever written, in my opinion. It demonstrates a complex storyline in an intricate and dream like manner, and gives us one of the most truthful and affecting love stories ever captured on film. Be warned - this movie will stay with you for a very long time, and you will almost certainly start to see parallels in your own life. Such is the beauty and power of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind. A proud 10 out of 10!-10/10\n",

      "This is, in my opinion, one of the best films I've ever seen. I have only seen very few films that don't mold to what the general public views love and actually bring to attention the way relationships truly are; a constant struggle that usually ends in anger or hatred, and afterwords realize that the insecurities that one has eventually takes control of every situation. This story is an excellent display of the human psyche involving love, which I haven't seen very often. A movie that I find to be similar is Edward Scissorhands. I made the connection between the two films because they both deal with love going unexpressed as the end result. It's hard to rate the two because they're both very different, even though at the end the same feeling is shared. Edward Scissorhands is more of a fantasy or fairy tale, and doesn't really go into too much depth of the feelings of the characters, which can allow the viewers to explore that with their own point of view. Eternal Sunshine is more harsh and for the most part presents the emotions in a way that is fairly obvious\n",
      "764\n",
      "For me it was a second time to watch Eternal... Around a year after first view. The stuff is as great as it was then. I'd like to point out what a great performance of Jim Carrey this movie really is. For a long time I belonged to the probably pretty large group of people who just hated Carrey altogether with those stupid and kick-in-the-ass \"comedies\" he was appearing in. My view of him started to change when I saw \"Man on the Moon\". A different, multidimensional character started to appear. So Eternal was not a complete surprise in that sense. Still, in this film he proves himself being a true actor. Just the same can be said about Kate Winslet, of course. What is now left is to hope that there will be more chances for Carrey to show his acting skills at their best!\n",
      "765\n",
      "I don't think there are enough appraisal words to bring to this movie. I watched it while going thru a depressive heartbreak, and it proved to be the perfect remedy. This is not just a movie, it is a brilliant \"painting\" about deep feelings, about love's eternal comeback victory, about people we don't appreciate until we lose them, about hope, fear and everything that comes with love's hard road journey. This movie will haunt you with flashbacks long after you've seen it, making you watch it again and again. Jim Carrey didn't win the Oscar, as I've expected to, but I think its better this way, the prize for Best Actor, would have been too little for his enormous talent. He showed everyone that he is not just a comedy actor with silly moves, but that he can play drama very well, making the character look very natural, and this makes him a perfect actor, an exceptional one I must say. I was also very impressed with Kate Winslet's playing. She was absolutely lovable and charismatic making the character's messy way of living very impressive. With this role and the one in \"Finding Neverland\" she has established herself as one of the most talented and respectful actresses of our times. Also, great music by Jon Brion and Beck, it stuck to my mind for weeks. Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have made a masterpiece hard to equal by anyone, even by themselves I guess. Remember, if you're ever feeling down, this is the movie to watch! It will probably hurt a little, but it will bring to you serenity.\n",

The acting is brilliant. The script is well done, with just the right amount of swearing in context to believe the characters. The plot is humorous, dark and touching.Kate Winslett and Jim Carrey portray people who are very flawed, in a very flawed relationship, trying to work out their differences in an unconventional way. Smaller roles by Elijiah Wood and Kirsten Dunst are also done very well. I loved this film because you really believe the two main characters could be someone you see walking down a busy street. And the way they seem to slip in and out of reality is masterfully achieved. Most of all I loved the ending, but I'll let you find out what that is... All in all I really loved this movie!!\n",

I was transported into a world of such intense emotion and completely forgot about my surroundings and circumstances. I was really swept away by the superb performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslot. The story is so outrageous, yet in this movie, so believable! The supporting characters are fantastic, and the movie as a whole, from start to finish keeps you're mind enraptured, and transports you into Joel and Clementines world, and the beginning and ending, and yet another beginning of their love. The underlying message to the story, which could mean so many things to so many people is clearly shown in the plots and sub plots of the movie.

My modest effort at a review pales in comparison to a previously well-written piece - I will only say I've now watched this movie upwards of ten times, and the tug on my heart and admiration for the directing excellence and cast just keeps getting stronger. Jim Carrey continues to amaze me, reprising- and surpassing -his unexpectedly sensitive and brilliant performance in The Truman Show. I felt compelled to offer my humble opinion of this fine production. I can't help but wonder if Mr. Carrey had a hand in writing the script, or screenplay. The role suits him perfectly.

This film will be an all time classic...and it will be studied in film schools around the world (it already has been in some) Jon Brion's score is so beautiful and subtle...and has wonderful variations from whimsical and playful to romantic, and excitement as the memories are being erased in the more thrilling sequences.This film is a masterpiece and Michel Gondry is a great artist.\n",

He is said to be a very weird but incredibly creative person in real life, and his works reflect that. Together with the extraordinary performance by the leading actors (Winslet and Carrey), his visual genius is the highlight of this movie. (By the way, in my humble opinion the co-stars weren't as good, especially Wood, whose expressiveness ranges from starry eyed to eyes wide open). Gondry's visuals give this movie a very particular touch, but they constitute a limitation, too, in that one would like to see Gondry's directing talent emerge in a very ordinary setting, without the frills that characterize his videos. Will he be able to stand the normality of an everyday life drama/comedy? He has to prove that video directors can be great movie directors without making a 2-hour version of the videos they're used to directing. Anyway, Gondry has succeeded where other high-profile video directors have failed (see Joseph Kahn's \"Torque\", which is as badly edited and confused as his U2 \"Elevation\" or Britney \"Toxic\" videos, or Mark Romanek's \"One hour photo\", which is so clean and neat it's almost boring like Lenny Kravitz \"if you can't say no\" or Jay-Z \"99 problems\").\n",

      "Maybe I have a different perception, maybe I was in the wrong mood for this movie, but I agree with the predecessors only in one point: Kate Winsley and Jim Carrey did an awesome job. I like movies like \"Twelve Monkeys\", \"Memento\". But watching this movie I get the impression that the bizarre elements are more likely an attempt to wrap an ever told love story in a 21th century coat. Further more there are a lot of illogic and not fitting side plots. Smoking joints and having something like sex in the bed with the patient suits right in movies like \"Donnie Darko\" and those from the Coen brothers but not in this movie. It seems that in the year 2004 even a classic love story cannot be told without elements of \"Total recall\", \"The Forgotten\", \"Vanilla Sky\". For my own very personal view, this movie is artificial not art.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman, seemingly one of today's hottest screenwriters, serves up another strangely cerebral concept with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. If you're a fan of the guy's work, you'll probably find this one a delightful treat too. What really struck me was the emotional relationship between the characters portrayed by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet¬Ö",
      "it was at least believable, if not realistic. But I guess that's sort of the point of the movie, an exploration of personal relationships (through a weird, scifi-like journey of the mind). In the end though, while I did enjoy the movie, at 32 on the IMDb 250, I think it's highly overrated.\n",

      "Though fans of Gondry's music videos will be a little underwhelmed by the visual whiz bang, the Kaufan script is better than his par. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) discovers that his ex Clementine (Kate Winslet) has erased their relationship from her memory after an intense but eventually short-lived relationship. Part in anger and part in sadness, Joel decides to visit the company, run by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and have the procedure done to him. During the procedure, Joel remembers all the heartache both good and bad of him and Clementine and starts to regret the erasing. In his mind, he struggles to fight what's happening to his physical body. The script integrates this with a parallel story of Stan, Patrick, and Mary, three people who work for the firm and are love-crossed, amongst each other and others. The music is wonderful and the movie makes you think about all the good and bad that come with relationships and how sometimes all you have are memories.\n",

      "You either love it or you hate it, but one thing is for sure; it's not going to be easy to forget. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, has not only, with the help of Gondry, taken his viewers though a well structured yet completely topsy-turvy maze of the inner workings of the human psyche but has managed to place the two main characters (Jim Carey and Kate Winslet) at the core of a classic bouncy yet re-invented screwball relationship scenario.What is very interesting and thought provoking about this film is how they approached the journey of the mind as it filters through Joel's memories, not only allowing him to see things as they were, but being able to place himself inside these memories and interact with the people they contain. This idea supplies us with a very accurate interpretation with the same helplessness we feel when trapped in a bad nightmare. It is through sequences like these the once music video director Michel Gondry can strut his stuff, providing us with a very stylistic representation of events, whether it be the disintegration of his childhood home or the teleportation through distant memories which in some cases lands him in bed in the middle of the beach where he first met Clementine. We join Joel as he travels through doors to places which should be miles and even years apart. But it works! Even though Gondry's visuals represent a surprisingly splintered path the movie is very fluid and testament to Gondry's ability to superbly compliment Kaufman's vision.The relationship in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind rings true to the screwball romantic comedy where after a series of absurdly blessed adventures of beautiful surrealism the characters may live happily ever after in their own clumsy way. We affectionately embrace the age old philosophy that it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. The film has given us a unique approach to the human psyche and allowed us to observe the value of our memories and how we choose to articulate them. If you were to erase your memories, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a keeper.\n",

      "Simply stated, Charlie Kaufman is one of the most talented, original presences in modern film. So far, he's delivered the strikingly innovative \"Being John Malkovich\", the quirky and amusing \"Human Nature\", and the vibrant masterpiece, \"Adaptation\". I find \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" to be somewhat more difficult to rate. I will tell you why later in the review.First, the story. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a man heart-broken by the loss of his eccentric girlfriend, Clementine (Winslet). He finds out she underwent a controversial new procedure (offered by a company named Lacuna, Inc.) that erases a selected memory from the human brain. Her selected memory was the long, meaningful relationship between her and Joel, which came to a bitter end. After learning this, Joel impulsively decides to have the procedure done on him. The film then shows us what goes on inside Joel's head while two young Lacuna employees (Wood, Ruffalo) carry out the procedure. Joel relives his relationship with Clementine, revealing all of their most intimate moments and quirks, and in the process, realizes how much he loves her. He then attempts to hide from the memory erasure with Clementine, burying himself in his most humiliating memories, trying to save some memory of the woman he now does not want to forget about.The film features wonderful performances from the entire cast, Carrey especially, who delivers arguably his best performance. The writing, of course, is top notch, Kaufman is a genius. The directing from former music video director Michel Gondry is teeming with life, vision, and personality. The film itself is absolutely excellent, as it perfectly portrays one of the most realistic, down-to-earth relationships ever conveyed through film, striking a delicate balance of joy and pain, revealing the couples most intimate and candid moments while never exploiting sex between the two characters.Now, here's my dilemma in rating this film. For some reason, I just don't love it like I feel I should. I don't know, for some reason it just doesn't connect with me like it does others. But this is just me personally. If I were rating this film on quality alone, I'd give it a 10/10. But since I rate films based on how much I like them, I give it an...8/10\n",

      "I had the pleasure of watching this movie for the first time with my girlfriend. Scrolling through the selections of movies, she saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind on the channel guide. She and both of her friends suddenly went ballistic, saying that I must watch this movie with them! I reluctantly agreed as I had never heard of it before. I checked the info, and saw that it had Jim Carry and Kate Winslet in it. 'Good actors', I thought to myself and I turned it on.My skepticism quickly vanished and I became hooked on the movie. The storyline, the soundtrack, and the especially the acting are excellent. Carry and Winslet are at their very best in this movie. Talk about chemistry between two actors, it's a shame they haven't been in more movies together! Carry shows in this movie that he indeed can transition into serious roles, much like Robin Williams did during his career. Winslet on the other hand absolutely steals the screen without taking the spotlight to much from Carry. They both touched emotions and feelings that most of us have experienced sometime in our life flawlessly.The storyline in itself is unique and makes you think of all the 'what if's'. It brings out every emotion you can possibly think of, and the soundtrack amplifies it. Speaking of the soundtrack, there are sometimes that it is absolutely haunting and in general fits perfectly.I'm a pretty solid guy, especially in front of my girlfriend. But the movie did indeed bring out the flow of tears. It has joined a short list of movies that have stimulated those hidden guy emotions. I found that the more I related to the characters, the harder it was to control my emotions.I highly recommend this movie if you like new and refreshing ideas on screen. It has joined my collection of DVD's and has joined my list of favorite movies. This movie will not leave your mind spotless, as it reminds us of the important, and sometimes forgotten parts of our lives.\n",

      "What is the purpose of reincarnation if one has no memory of a previous life? How can you learn from your mistakes if you've forgotten that you ever made them? And what passes from a previous life to the next if there is no memory of a previous existence?In a subtle way this movie addresses these questions. But instead of lifetimes, love affairs are used. And it's love that passes through the generations. Soul mates are destined to find each other, again and again, despite the trivial incompatibilities. This is a marvelous, original movie. Beautifully, and acted directed. The film is not really a science fiction. It's a moral parable.\n",

Iwatched it in the afternoon and invited a friend over to watch it in the evening... I have never watched a movie more than once in a months time let alone in the same day... The way Joel(Carry) tries to get out of the memories mapped to be erased lightens the mood of the movie and you start to have hope... The end when they are listening to the tapes shows the reality of the two love thirsty lovers... it is amazing how hard it is to make a movie like this without loop holes... like if the mind is erased wouldn't you think your mother would be like\"you need to get her... you were happier with her\" and bring her back into his memory??? but he doesn't even bother with the extreme details and allows the viewers imagination run wild...He didn't tell the story as if he read it from a text book... he told the story as if he lived it which allows the listener to run wild with their imagination... I loved the Story...Charlie Kaufman & Michel Gondry did an amazing job together on this one... Must See!!! A- *Top Shelf W.B.\n",

      "This film is quite simply jaw-dropping. Jim Carrey turns in a career-altering performance - one which I believe a lot of his fans were faithfully awaiting - as a lovestruck, confused individual who gradually comes to realize that his memories of the romance of his life were completely erased and by his hand, no less. The film itself is inventive, quirky and, I believe, a revolutionary step in not only romantic films, but in cinema as a whole. While many of you guys may be thinking that this is a chick flick and the total opposite of your own tastes, it is rather a film that can be incredibly enjoyable to all and especially to men, according to a survey at a film website (I forget the name just now) but the point is that you should let society's stereotypical views of romantic movies prevent you from renting this one.\n",

      "This movie is a love story, except if you go in to see it, it's anything but ordinary. First things first, you must let your imagination roam a little bit. The whole process of being able to actually be inside your own mind as you slowly watch the love of your life being erased in front of your very eyes can be a bit much if you don't use your imagination. Best thing to do, put yourself, whether your male or female, in Joel Barrish's (Jim Carey) shoes. Now, the basics of the story are very relatable. Man and woman meet, opposites attract, and they fall in love. However, as with all things in life, they come to part ways. Joel discovers rather quickly, after running into his former girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet), that she has had him permanently erased from her memory. Confused, Joel seeks out the doctor who performed the procedure, and in a fit of anger, possibly even revenge, he decides to have the procedure done himself. However, as the procedure takes place, as he moves from the last memory of Clementine (a wonderful scene mixed with harsh feelings and dialogue) backwards to the memories of when the relationship was at it's peak, he begins to realize that in his heart he still loves her. Joel panics, and begins to think of every way possible to change the track of his memories so that Clementine will still be there in his mind whenever he wakes up. Fate, nonetheless, does not conspire with him, and he finally comes to the last (or in this case, the first) memory; the one where he and Clementine first met. The following scene is absolutely wonderful. This is where it all comes together...everything that has happened in the story, with the addition of the strong feeling's Joel has for Clementine (and in Clementine's case, the feelings she may still have for Joel), it all climax's in this beautiful scene, highlighted with:Clementine: This is it, Joel...it's going to be gone soon. Joel: I know... Clementine: What should we do? Joel: (pauses) Enjoy it.This scene comes crashing down and gave me such a great case of emotion, because Joel, even after trying to hide from having Clementine erased learns this simple lesson: Life is fleeting. Life, and the people you meet and love, is a gift. And even though he knows he is about to lose her forever, instead of trying to run and hide, he swallows those feelings back, and tells himself to 'enjoy it,' a truly mature and engaging line that will bring chills down your spine. And the final scene in the house, brings the climax to it's end in a truly remarkable way. As they say their final goodbyes inside an old house on the beach, as Joel's character let's out every single emotion and thought inside of his heart out. Not only is the dialogue amazing, but the image of that memory being erased and the fact that he is losing her is amplified by the fact that as the scene slowly progresses, the house begins to fall apart. You begin to feel such an apathy for these characters, and maybe it's because we've all been there before. Everyone of us. This story is so relatable it forces you to become immersed in the story's emotions and characters. The writing and directing simply phenomenal, my hat's go off to Micheal Gondry. The only reason I give this movie a nine of ten is the ending. I won't give away too many details, because the ending makes the story. I would've changed the ending slightly and not have gone into the ending like the story portrays. However, my opinions aside, if you haven't seen this movie, you must. It may be confusing at first, but you'll get it. Watch it again if you need to. But if after watching this movie, if you don't re-examine certain aspects of your life, if this movie doesn't make you love your significant other ever more or make you pine for the lost love of your life, then unfortunately you didn't get the point. Watch it one more time. For those of you who do feel as if you have watched an eye-opener, take life by the horns and 'enjoy it.'\n",

      "Michael Gondry's Eternal Sunshine is a brilliant piece of film-making. The story is told in such an original, yet charming and emotionally charged manner that one basically has no choice but to feel for these characters. Its the story of a man (carrey) who falls in love with an oddball girlfriend who suddenly acts like she doesn't know him. The film is superbly written, Kaufman's screenplay is finer and richer here than in Adaptation or Confessions of a Dangerous mind, IMO. The performances also make this film worthwhile, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are absolutely perfect in the leads, both deserve Oscar nominations last year if you ask me. Also two actors who i usually do not like much in Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are at the absolute best here (partially due to them, mostly due to the great script). Mark Ruffalo was a highlight for me, never have i seen him be a character so good, he was my most memorable performance of the film. Tom Wilkinson was also great, playing the role of a doctor. This film is beautiful, with great music, direction and extremely good chemistry. This is one of rare love story type films that i love, saw it twice just this week. 10/10 #50 on my list of all-time favorite films\n",

      "If you are looking for a film about love that doesn't include cheesy chat-up lines, heart-shaped chocolate boxes and the guarantee that the protagonists will all live 'happily ever after', then this is likely to be a film for you. For once, I have found a film that is not about love in a fairy-tale, but instead, is about true love that you find in the real world, with the bad and dull bits left in. In contrast though, this film never gets dull. For the entirety of my first viewing, I was sat in the cinema, with my eyes glued to the screen and welling-up throughout. I was impressed by Kate Winslet's (Clementine) and Jim Carrey's (Joel) acting, especially since I can not sit through most of Carrey's films because I generally find him so annoying! In this film though, Carrey performs wonderfully as a man whose life seems a bit dull, until he falls in love with an exciting and interesting woman, who brings out his personality and makes him shine. Winslet has succeeded in acting superbly, once again as a character who does not quite conform and strives to be different. Carrey and Winslet have succeeded in producing an extremely convincing relationship as well; working even better together than they do alone.The heart-felt performances from the supporting actors can not be ignored either. Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson add an essential ingredient to the film, with another, unexpected relationship that, at first appears to support the work that Wilkinson's character (Howard) does. Howard works at 'Lacuna' which is a company that erases parts of people's memories so they can forget whatever they wish to. The affects of the procedure are beautifully described by an extract from Alexander Pope's poem 'Eloisa to Abelard' that provides a wonderful juxtaposition to images that are gradually being erased of Joel and Clementine when their relationship was happy, as the poem is read by Mary (Dunst)over the images that so strongly suggest that to have your memory erased is to take away a part of your soul. At the end of the film Mary and Howards relationship becomes proof that memories are what makes us who we are, and to forget a part of our lives is to forget a part of who we have become.As Joel goes through the procedure for erasing his memory he starts to remember why he felt so much for Clementine and rediscovers his love for her and as they meet by co-incidence in Mauntauk after they have both had the procedure they can start to rebuild their relationship as if it were the first time that they have met. What I find most wonderful about 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' though, is that after they discover that they have had the procedure to erase each other from their memories and why they wanted to forget each other, they agree to give it another go because it is worth it, purely to remember the good times, even if the outcome is the same as last time.Overall, the entire film really sums up what a true relationship is about and is beautiful to watch, not only because of the superb script by Charlie Kaufman, but also because of the wonderfully created mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing and music. Consequently, I give this film a very big thumbs up! Watch it, you won't regret it!\n",

Well, if you're looking for Jim Carey to be like he was in that ANIMAL DETECTIVE MOVIE, then this is the MOVIE NOT FOR YOU.The movie is about a very emotional Jim Carey and his weird relationship with that girl from TITANIC. It was a good movie but FRODO did not deliver the goods as he did in the Lord of Rings movies. His character was lame. The doctor was good.

The plot wasn't bad or anything, but it could've been better. I was pretty much bored near the end of this movie, not because it was a bad movie, but because I just found it to be neutral. Nothing was going on in this movie. I had great expectations before having watched this movie. After hearing all the time from everyone that this movie was the : \"Best Film of the Year!\", i was amazed at how disappointed I actually was at this movie. Mostly because I thought it was going to be a masterpiece or a \"one-of-a-kind.\" But, what I liked a lot of this movie, was the morality of the story. I got to admit that Kaufman's got a lot of guts making his movies, and I respect that. This movie wasn't at all as I supposed it to be, but, then again, no movie is perfect.Overall score: 6/10\n",

But now when I'm a bit older and know a bit more about movies i still love he's comic movie, but i also love he's more dramatic movies like The Truman Show and The Majestic...Then last year a new movie came out with Jim Carrey co-Starring with Kate Winslet, and i thought to myself: it sounds exciting. I went to the movies and saw it and thought it was going to be a ordinary romantic flick, but MY GOD! when the movie was over, i just wanted to see it again and again and again.. The Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman wanted to make a romantic movie like no other, and that's exactly what it is.. a fresh, beautiful movie with music that really touch your soul.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet and so as the rest of the cast does a magnificent job and you totally forget your watching the man who gave us Ace Ventura and The Mask 11 years ago. He plays Joel, a Shy guy who cant communicate with woman and has the problem that he falls in love with every woman he sees. Kate Winslet, as Clementine, on the other hand, plays the total opposite of Jim , she's a spontaneous, wild, bobbling person who Joel falls in love with immediately. They both fall in love and has a wild love life, she really gets the wild side of Joel to come out. Both it doesn't last and Clementine, spontaneous as she is, gets him erased from her memory, which of course make Joel sad, and leads to that he decides to get the same thing as she did. But while the erasing goes on he suddenly regrets and want to call it off. The story is told in it's own special way, which make perfectly sense if you see the whole movie. So can i recommend this movie? yes i can. It's my favorite movie to date and i don't think any movie will top it.\n",

      "Jim Carey and Kate Winslet give endearing performances as the two main characters who fall in love. The idea that one could completely erase someone from their mind is a complicated and interesting one. After all, isn't that what time does? Time allows us to remember the pleasant and dulls the unpleasant. This movie also speaks to the nature of love. Why do we love the people we do? Is the pleasure worth the pain? etc. I think the movie tries to answer some of these questions.My problem with the movie is it tries to be too clever with all the time changes and jumping around. I also thought the some of the dealings of the other characters was unnecessary. It is a little hard to follow. I think it could have been more emotionally potent with a little straightforwardness. It was still a good and thought provoking movie.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: 8/10: Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is in a league of his own. If cloning is ever allowed in the United States we need to clone Mr. Kaufman. (If there is any community that will embrace cloning it will be Hollywood. Name any other place in America where nepotism is a religion. Hiring your own clone is the ultimate in nepotism.)Charlie Kaufman has found that fine line between realistic dialog and interesting dialog. Characters talk, fight and fall in love just like they do in real life. But unlike most movies that try to mirror real life speech Kaufman makes it interesting. (Of course it helps that Kaufman's always throws in the bizarre such as adulterous homicidal book authors addicted to sniffing Angel Trumpet or people entering John Malkovich's head.) Now just imagine if a Kaufman clone could, oh I don't know, help George Lucas write romantic dialog. (If there is anyone who occupies the opposite side of the good dialog screen writing scale it's Lucas. His dialog is so wooden it would embarrass a marionette. Plus think of the Variety headline \"Kaufman Clone helps pen Clones\") Oh the movie. Eternal Sunshine has some great performances especially by a subdued Jim Carrey. (This should surprise but after his brilliant turn in Man on the Moon, the only real surprise is how with his quiet desperate performance you forget its Carrey.) There is a really good subplot about the goings on at a mind erasure clinic. (The movie sensibly sets it up as a no big deal four-man operation like one of those laser eye surgery places in a strip mall.)And there is a really realistic romance between Carrey and Kate Winslet that blows most movies away. Currently ranked thirty-second greatest movie of all time by the IMDb. Eternal Sunshine is one movie you won't be able to get out of your head.\n",

Ultimately love conquers all, just like in the movies.I saw this film 4 times in the theater and I bought the DVD. As always, the small screen does not do the film justice. The 2-disc collectors edition has a few more deleted scenes, but it does not add that much to the film.This is a very special film.

      "This movie is probably one of the best love stories of all time. Its main strength is that it shows us a really human couple relationship, with good moments and bad moments. Even while being a science-fiction movie, it shows a normal story, the normal life of two lost people, to whom we can easily identify. We face a introverted everyman, wonderfully played by an unexpected Jim Carrey in his best role to this day, a man who doesn't really know how to handle love, and even life ; and an unpredictable girl played by a fabulous Kate Winslet. Both are in love, both are lost, both have many doubts, and hopes. Both show us a real face of love, so frail and so strong at the same time, and, for many of us, they show a reflection of our own feelings, doubts, and hopes... and hearts.This movie is a marvel.

It certainly wasn't funny for us.But that wasn't Carrey's fault, who is brilliant as Joel. Joel falls in love with Clementine, played by Kate Winslet in her best performance ever. After an argument, they decide to take to drastic measures to rid themselves from all memories of each other.This is the start of a surrealistic sequence, where we share what goes on inside Joel's mind as the erasing process takes place. Fascinating stuff, except that the woman stubbornly refused to stop laughing: angry looks or verbal abuse didn't help, and the movie's plot apparently didn't either.I'll probably buy this on DVD when it comes out so we can see it again.\n",

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was one the best films I've seen in some time. Penned by Charlie Kaufman (\"Adaptation\") and based on a story that Kaufman wrote with newcomer Pierre Bismuth and director Michel Gondry (\"Human Nature\" ¬ñ also a Kaufman story), \"...Sunshine...\" has the odd effect of warming the heart of the coldest prosaic cynic and convincing them that romance is not only in your head but in all the world around you. No matter what drastic measures you take to clear your mind, you will always find the one you love ¬ñ for better or worse. This is the odd part: This film realistically covers the \"worse\". It is at times as funny and as charming as a proto-typical, teen-friendly romantic comedy, but at its core is this heavy, adult-relationship, surrealistic drama. Just thirty seconds from a laugh-out-loud segment you could be saying to yourself, \"Aww...that's sweet...\", and thirty seconds after that be bawling your eyes out with you fists clenched tight screaming silently inside your head \"Why, God, WHY?!\" Or that could just be me. Regardless, the movie's passion and intensity alone is worth the price of admission. Yet there so many more reasons to see it. Using old-school techniques, archaic tricks and outdated equipment (whether out of love for traditional film-making or due to minimal financial resources is unclear), Gondry creates a visually beautiful film that tells a beautiful story. How many times have you seen a great story turned into a mediocre movie because of over-stylized production or flashy (and often unnecessary) special effects? The filmmaker's devotion to simplicity keeps the audience's focus where it should be: On Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey. These actors are two of the most famous and attractive people on the planet, yet they are so good are transforming into characters that ten minutes into the picture you forget that you are watching Superstars and truly believe that Clementine and Joel are ordinary people sharing an extraordinary bond. I'm sorry, I refuse to give anymore away than I already have and I can't write anymore about this unique, brilliant and truly artistic film without wanting to tell you every little detail about it, scene by scene, quoting line by line. I must show some restraint. What I can tell you, however, is that it overwhelmingly affected me. It is one of those rare moments in cinema where you realize you are witnessing something grand. In 60 years will it be considered the \"Citizen Kane\" of its day? Maybe not. But it might be the \"Casablanca\". Oh! If only Ilsa had whispered to Rick \"...Meet me in Montauk...\"\n",

      "Though it goes without saying if you've seen his earlier work, Charlie Kaufman is amazing. He is and will always be known as one of the most original story and screenplay writers of our time. In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, he attempts to show us an understanding of a person's mind when it comes to such an emotional attachment as being in love with someone. Based around a small limerick by Alexander Pope which states: \"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd\", Kaufman exemplifies this through the eyes of Joel Barish, played brilliantly by Jim Carrey. In the story, Joel Barish has a hard time coming to terms with the fact that the woman he loves (Clementine Kruczynski played by Kate Winslet in a stunning role as well) has taken part in a new scientific way of erasing bad memories. When he goes to the doctor who performed the procedure, he also wishes to have his memories of her erased from his mind. Though, while the procedure takes place, Joel finds himself having second thoughts. What ensues is an utterly odd but at the same time breathtaking film. It once again asks the question why we can't forget the ones we love, no matter what happens. Also starring Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood.\n",

      "This movie really touched a nerve with me - it's the day after I watched it & I can't stop thinking about it.The editing is amazing (very trippy & reminded me of my experiences with acid and ketamine). It had scenes that felt like dreams I've had before, mostly to do with love & loss. Perhaps I have some issues that need a closer look :)Watching this film forced me to explore my deepest fears and feelings about being in love, and it brought up emotions I thought were buried deep inside me. If I can get through this (the effects of seeing this film), I think I may have a chance at dealing with the stressful but compelling & ultimately rewarding ordeal of being in love - something I never thought I could achieve.The fact that at the end, the two main characters are faced with a summary of their worst features, as perceived by the other party, makes it even more difficult for me to deal with - I can't possibly write this comment from any perspective other than my own experience.Never have I felt so emotional after seeing a film - I can't wait to put myself through it all over again.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was bittersweet. I have read many, many other comments on IMDb regarding this film, some of which blasted it. Those folks that don't dig this film are the ones who just are not getting it. That has been said by others besides me. I won't go into plot because of the spoiler factor, as there is potential for much spoilage, however, I will remark that this film touched me where no film has gone before. I became somewhat confused at times during my viewing it but that did not deter me from enjoying it. I like a little mystery with my movie. The camera pace was quite hyper at times, but i think this was needed in order to convey the message. The cast is fantastic, although I did not particularly get into the supporting roles until one or two subplots sprang up. As for Carrey and Winslett, each carried their roles like no one else could have. I rarely heap praise on anything that gets the hype this film got, but I feel that this film is special. I wanted to pity Joel and hate Clem, but the progression of the film wouldn't allow it. The characters were not even the best part of this movie...the storyline is intriguing, whether you have been in love or not, whether you have failed at love or not.I laughed, I got a little choked, and will definitely see this film a second time as I am sure amid the quick moments of some of the camera work I may have missed some things that I should have caught the first go around. I am amazed at the films such as Groundhog Day and Eternal Sunshine because they carry such weight with me. It could just be me, but Groundhog and Eternal Sunshine shared more than one or two qualities regarding relationships. Direction for Eternal was a bit more artsy for the sake of the plot, I think. At any rate, I give Eternal Sunshine a 10/10 and it deserves everything it gets when they start handing out awards. This film should not have been advertised as a comedy, although it could pass as the 2004 equivalent of Annie Hall with great comedic timing exhibited by Carrey when needed. There is a certain something that really grabbed me about this film and I wish I knew what it was exactly...just see it and experience it for yourself. Winslett is just right in this. Particularly the scene when Joel relies on a visual of one of Clem's most redeeming qualities...as a child, though, all Joel could say was \"YUCK\". I wonder if Bill Murray could play opposite Kate Winslett in The Eternal Sunny Groundhog Day...now there is a film that'll touch any body, any where...But seriously folks...am I the only one who noticed the symbolism of Joel and Clem carrying their baggage into the train station as people began disappearing around them? The baggage is symbolically left behind as Joel is running (as a memory) to hide from the erasers with Clem. Could be that I might be reading too much into this, but I'd say it sure seems that way. Eternal Sunshine is the most cerebral movie I've ever seen. I am not the least bit \"artsy\", nor do I want to portray myself as an intellectual. However, I know an entertaining movie when I see one. It's not for everyone, but it is certainly worth the time to visit this film if you have an interest in films that don't insult your intelligence by trying to feed you the same formula as the run of the mill so often represents. I'm glad that movies like this come along so seldom as it makes me appreciate them that much more.\n",

      "This movie did something very original. Unfortunately for me it did not strike the emotional chord necessary in a love story. I wanted to feel more for the characters than what I actually did. I thought the scenes of Ruffalo and Dunst getting stoned while Carrey's mind erasure was taking place was out of character for the film. It just seemed so opposite to the point the film was trying to make. But the scenes where Carrey has second thoughts about his love for Winslet and then tries to resist his mind erasure and we see the visuals in his head play out was something special. A good film but not a great one. At the time of this review it stands at #32 all time on the IMDb's top 250 films list. Come on, guys. Better than love stories with great sub plots like 'On the Waterfront', 'The Apartment' and 'City Lights'? I think not!\n",

      "Entering the movie theater, I expected the Eternal sunshine..., to be one of the many mediocre movies dealing with love, where the most intriguing thing would be when and how the couple will kiss, make up and then the lights will go on and the female part of the theater will leave happy while the males, a little bored and already thinking of going home and watching the sport news, will be trying to suppress their moans....but NO this movie was something different, something out of the ordinary and truly inspiring. It would recommend it to anyone who is willing to explore his own feelings, reach out to the bottom of his soul and maybe, just maybe at the end this will help you understand why men and women need each other no matter what\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a movie you have to see. Well, okay, lot's of people won't like it, but that always happens. If you have a mind for creative, unconventional film, you'll like it. Maybe even love it. If it weren't for the magnificent \"Napoleon Dynamite\" this would be the most creative, unconventional film of the year. Okay. So it's the second most.Of course, Charlie Kaufman wrote it, so we should expect that, I guess. Kaufman's first widely liked film was \"Being John Malkovich\", in which John Cusack and others venture into John Malkovich's mind and wreak all sorts of havoc. His second (and best) was \"Adaptation\", which was supposed to be based on a Susan Orlean book but then became a quirky drama about Charlie Kaufman ¬ñ yes, the same Charlie Kaufman ¬ñ and his deep personal problems. After these two films, people would just sit there, long after the movie ended, thinking \"Huh?\". But the films were just so intriguing and different that those same people loved them, too.And now comes another abstract, quirky creative film. This time it's directed by Michael Gondry, not Spike Jonze, proving that directors other than Jonze can successfully work with Kaufman's material. The film starts with Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) waking up in bed, then spontaneously ditching work to take a walk on a beach. He sees a woman far away. He sees her again, in a restaurant, then at the train station, then in the train. Then she talks to him, introducing herself as Clementine (Kate Winslet).They like each other, they hit it off and spend a whole day together. Then a few things happen, and we see that their relationship has ended badly and Clementine has impulsively went to a rag-tag business called \"Lacuna Inc.\" to have her memory of Joel erased. Joel is shattered when he finds out, and so he Joel goes to the business to check it out.The technology is impressive, but it is a strange little office, run by the soft-spoken Dr. Howard (Tom Wilkinson) and with a team that practically worships him, made up of Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood) and secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst).Joel asks for the procedure to be done, and so Stan and Patrick are sent to his apartment at night after Joel's been drugged to go to work on him. They attach a large metal dome to his head as he lies in bed, set up a computer and start. These scenes are pretty funny, because it's surprising how the team using this fantastic new technology is so detached and incompetent. Stan and Patrick drink and talk about women and whatnot, and then Mary comes over and they get high and do...well, nothing suitable for a successful workplace.The bulk of the movie takes place in Joel's mind, where his subconscious (in the form of Jim Carrey) tries to fight the process and hold onto as many great memories of Clementine as he can. We get many episodes showing great (and not-so-great) moments in the past of their relationship, where Joel is simultaneously either enacting in them, watching them, or trying to break free to save his wonderful memories. Confusing, I know.So Joel and Clementine (the Clementine made up of the memories in Joel's mind, not the real Clementine) come up with a plan to hide in memories in which Clementine was not present, and we get many scenes of Joel as a child, or in a miniature child's body, or...well, it's bizarre, but bizarrely effective.Back in the real world Dr. Howard is called over to solve the problem, and we see the real Clementine breaking down, and also being romanced by Patrick...lots of other stuff happens, but that's all I can explain. See the movie and you'll get it.The film has been widely praised because of its fantastic portrayal of dream states (which I don't think are as good as those in \"Waking Life\" but hey, that's just me) but the film is primarily about its characters. Sure, the dream states are great, I loved how things are crumbling or disappearing around Joel as his memories are being erased, but it's more stupendous because of its characters, which all are fully realized and perfectly acted.I have a few qualms with the film, my first and most important one being that there are many romantic scenes with Joel and the Clem of his mind, but they aren't effective or sincere because this is not the real Clem, and nothing is or can possibly be accomplished when Joel asks her \"Can't we give it another go?\". The scenes with the real Clem and the real Joel are definitely the most touching. Also, sometimes the dream scenes feel repetitive, and there are a few moments where there are so many things happening at once that the focus is momentarily gone and the movie is just too frantic.It has a heart at its center though, a wonderfully imaginative screenplay and fantastic performances from Jim Carrey (at his best here), Winslet, Wilkinson, Dunst, Ruffalo and Wood. The flaws are forgotten soon after you watch the film, and the strange albeit touching story stays with you. It's good.8/10.\n",

      "As I have said in other reviews, Jim Carrey is one of my favorite actors, both comedic and dramatic. He is able to take the plot of this sometimes bizarre and often intimate film, and bring it to a personal level that the viewer can relate to.It is a means of looking closely at the ups and downs of a relationship between a man and a woman. This is an engrossing film and one you will need to pay attention to if you hope to follow it completely.Frenetic effects and surprising plot twists are handled well in this movie, but you need to be a fan of the somewhat obscure to truly appreciate this movie.Overall I did enjoy this movie, and was moved by both its symbolism as well as its direct poignancy. I recommend seeing this movie.\n",

      "I just have to write a few words to neutralize the overrated position that this movie holds in the top 250.The movie is quite entertaining and fairly original, but it certainly does NOT belong amongst the 250 BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME.I have to admit that this movie was one of the best films of 2004, but hey, that was easy since 2004 was a disgrace. Many people thought that \"Lost in Translation\" was the best movie of 2004 and I think that says enough. Don't get me wrong, I agree that these two movies were the best in 2004, but (again) they cannot compete with the majority in the top 250.I saw this movie two months ago in the cinema and I can't even remember what it was about. I remember liking it, though. 7 points out of 10.\n",
      "803\n",
      "Though I disagree with many thematic interpretations (because of my biases about relationships and the mind), I find the most praise of this film accurate.From Carrey's remarkably believable humanity, introversion, and the subtle yet unmistakable way in which his emotions leak through an apparently sterile exterior to Winslet's chaotic, fun, and intensely emotional ways to the supporting casts rock solid performances, I think it would be hard to say there was finer acting in any film this year.Until I watched the little vignette of the DVD, I appreciated Gondry's direction less. And I think that is as it should be. Direction one can take for granted is typically solid and reflective of the writing. Some of the technical challenges met and the spontaneity in the direction were very impressive. In lesser hands, I believe this story could easily have come across much more poorly.The musical score complemented the film, never incongruous or distracting. The moods produced by the music did a fine job of reflecting the paradoxes and ambiguities in this complex film.It's my personal belief that the writing in a film is the true guide of a movie, which is generally a story, and a great film must have a solid writing foundation. The more I see of Charlie Kaufmann, the more I like. I appreciate his quirkiness that produces movies which involve greater imagination and unfamiliar territory. I also feel like he has an excellent understanding of his own feelings and desires. I get this sense because I get the feeling I can relate to his movies and that he can understand how I feel which, because I have no true basis to understand others, makes me suspect he understands emotions as a whole. I'll make the hyperbolic statement of saying that Kaufmann understands humanity. You can sort of discern Kaufmann's understanding of humanity and feel it intuitively though it's not logically accessible.Kaufmann makes efforts to portray the complexities that occur within the human mind and related to being in love with what I would consider to be obviously the wrong person. I'm a sucker for a script and film that does a fine job of portraying internal mind states and thoughts, for a film which details paradoxes and complexities involving human emotion, and a film to which I can personally relate. The film scores on all counts. Gondry's solid understanding of the script brings Kaufmann's script to life. Though I'm biased toward films involving the mind like Fight Club, Altered States and Freejack, I believe given that the mind is our way of understanding the world, it is a fairly applicable subject to all.Thematically, I depart from other reviewers. Many see a positive statement about love, giving it a second chance, or believed that Carrey's character really had something in his relationship at the end.I think the two main characters make naive, poor relationship decisions. The two are so clearly incompatible (Kate's character is bright and self-honest enough to see it) yet they pursue a relationship a second time with obvious clues (particularly the knowledge that they hated each other only days before, prior to having their brains wiped) that it will fail. I don't believe they have any kind of reasonable chance at another relationship. I think instead that Joel desperately needs a human connection and that Clementine is self-destructive consistent with high levels of internal chaos. I don't think that's the theme though.I think the movie, more than anything, stresses that there is positive in loving relationships (the clich√© \"tis better to have loved...\") and that people need certain things at certain times. Joel and Clementine need something like each other and once they are excised from each others' minds, they again seek their psychological and emotional fuel.We see clich√©d notion that one cannot wipe the slate of the human mind. We see this in Robocop, A Long Kiss Goodnight, Total Recall and many other films. We see a sense of destiny related to the mind, a sense of complexity to the mind that promotes the notion the mind is too complex to fully understand. Joel and Clementine seem to both have some leftover trauma from their relationship leaving Joel much more withdrawn than in his earliest memories, and Clementine panicky (responding completely differently to a different person, but with identical context and words) like when the Patrick reenacts the scene on the ice attempting to seduce Clementine. Is Kaufmann promoting a separation of the mind into conscious and non-conscious parts? Do the non-conscious parts of these two bring them together? Is it all some intangibly sexual attraction that drove them and once the conscious part is gone they are free to pursue each other? Clearly, the fact that the two pursue each other, going out of their way to interact is indicative of some intangible attraction.Kaufmann searches for the positive in painful relationships with incredibly poignant results as Joel travels back to the more loving and less hostile, dysfunctional periods in his relationship with Clementine. I went from not liking Joe's boring and socially inept ways to relating to him profoundly. The film reinforces the idea that all experiences are ultimately positive. Being able to critically examine the past and feel melancholy, rather than angry or hurt gives Joel his most human appearance, providing the film with its greatest tenderness. The last ditch effort to save Clementine's memory shows wisdom and short-sighted thinking (considering mostly how he felt right then rather than long-term consequences) and show that Joel is impulsive and flawed just like the rest of us.These characters have the tragic (to Greek proportions) interaction that makes them very human and very easy with which an audience to identify. While the technical and substantive components of this film are truly great, I think it is the human component that makes this film most impressive.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman is the first writer auteur. I mean, how many people know I.A.L. Diamond (Billy Wilder's partner), Nunnelly Johnson (Howard Hawks, et al.) For once the screenwriter is all important (or at least most important). Change directors, change stars and you STILL have a distinctly \"Charlie Kaufman\" event.Admittedly, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" lacks the shear audacious originality of \"Being John Malcovitch\" or \"Adaptation.\" After John Woo had much the same concept for \"Paycheck.\" Nonetheless, Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry (He a low-tech genius) have fashioned a story out of time. Frequently, it is very difficult to determine \"what\" is happening \"when;\" and, for once, that's a good thing.It's Kaufman genius to place the company performing the \"brain damaging\" treatment, in what appears to be a dishevel dentist's office. Or to give the \"medical\" crew less professional than the worst \"roto rooter\" service.Jim Carrey is brilliant as Joel, the uptight writer/artist of journals. Joel lives his life through his writing, whereas \"Clementine\" (Kate Winslett, simply lives. It's Joel who suddenly realize the tremendous loss of experience, even the unpleasant ones.The profound subplot involving Kursten Dunst came at me right out of left field. However, this \"real time\" experience gives the movie its weight; more so than anything Joel or Clementine express or experience.If Charlie Kaufman can be faulted, it's that he can't leave well enough alone. The silliness nearly undid \"Being John Malcovitch,\" and it doesn't help here. If \"Adaptation\" is any indication, this is due to Charlie's neuroses. I hope one day to see one of his movies, where he doesn't eventually cheapen his characters a mite with his absurdities. For now, it's just enough to appreciate the beauty of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" until it, too fades from conscious memory.Charlie Kaufman Charlie Kaufm CharlI give \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" a \"9\" for originality, performances, direction and singular profundity.\n",

      "For three quarters of this movie, I kept asking myself \"How can the director sustain (and even build upon) this level of intensity and inventiveness?\" The relationship intrigue unfolds like Ten Little Indians, except with what you think are just two characters. This movie will win the best original screenplay Oscar or we should never watch the Academy Awards ever again. I should add that Jim Carrey gives us another Truman Show performance, showing again that his real talent lies in more serious acting. Kate Winslet also makes a believable, nuanced foil in this twisted tete-a-tete. So, what happens in the last 1/4 of the movie? Well, there's a rather silly subplot that makes fun of the state of American workers (and of relationships in general) that takes away from the emotional momentum. The ending isn't entirely satisfying either...perhaps others who have watched have a better ending suggestion. Nevertheless, this movie's superb acting, dialog, and directing deserve special mention -- for 3/4 of its length, it is pure, unadulterated genius; and for the last 1/4, merely very fine.\n",

      "This is a great looking film, top directing, superb acting and a quality script. Even so I came away feeling unsatisfied. Jim Carrey is an excellent actor and he worked with Kate Winslet very well. Its just a shame this movie feels like it has a inferiority complex.It dwelt on the mind erasure process far to long. I respect that they wanted to relate the romance to memories etc, etc.. but they lost an opportunity to make a great film and ultimately made tosh. This film is as pointless as Lost In Translation.A visually stunning film that never really gets to grips with its plot. However the performances of the leads are good enough to make one care for the characters we are expected to explore.At the end of the day a boring film.\n",
      "807\n",
      "I am sincerely curious as to why so many people seem to like this film. Does it awaken their own desire for \"endless and unquenchable\" love? Have they tired of \"12 Monkeys\", \"Total Recall\", \"The Butterfly Effect\", and \"Irreversible\"? Do they want to feel hip? Is there a Carrey/Winslett cult out there? Do people want to see their primal fears about exactly what medical personnel do when they are undergoing a procedure? But, let's get back to the movie itself and some of its major flaws.First, as many reviewers have pointed out, Carrey and Winslett simply have no chemistry. Zero. Nada. Zip. This lack of chemistry makes it very difficult for us to believe that Carrey would be so tenacious and, presumably, unique in fighting the memory manipulation. The fact that he does can only reflect the weakness of character and the dependence he has on others for any meaning in his life. Basically, he's one degree removed from being a stalker.Second, there is no plot. There is a cute concept - not original, but cute - around which a whole movie has been made. Compare this to \"The Sixth Sense\", which was also a movie built around a single \"trick,\" but which redeemed itself through the rich characterizations and growth of the main characters. ESotSM has none of this.Third, the ONE actual piece of plot involves a very silly deus ex machina the writer uses to get out of a clumsy situation. It is unbelievable, irrational, and unsatisfying. (I'm referring of course to the \"subplot\" involving Dunst and Wood.) I find it quite insulting.Last, it is just plain boring. The acting is flat and the characters simply don't earn our sympathy enough for us to care what goes on in their \"dream or reality?\" sequences. In \"Groundhog Day\", most people actually come to care for the self-centered and boorish Bill Murray as he repeats that single day ad infinitum. You won't do that in this movie.In summary, this is a slightly classier version of a Harlequin romance: True Love is too strong to be denied, even using the strongest force (technology) available to us. Now that I think about it, Fabio would have been good in Carrey's role, since Carrey can't seem to master that look of longing he needs.* out of ****\n",

      "It has been a few years since I've added a user comment, but after seeing this film and reading some of the reactions before mine, I can't keep quiet. As of now, the Db has 783 comments in all for ETOSM, and from the 30 or 40 I've read, it would seem this film is destined to be the next all time classic: think Godfather, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, whatever. There are a few commentators who lean otherwise, and generally they seem to simply hate the film. I can't agree with either side, though.On the one hand, I liked the film on several levels. Underneath everything, it was an above-average average-Joe sentimental romance that keeps one hooked to the end. Overlying everything, it had technical appeal that almost erases any flaws. And throughout, Jim Carrey's acting nudges the film up another level, not just because Carrey is intriguingly out of character but because he actually makes a stereotypically boring nerd character more believable.On the other hand, there are flaws. I'm not impressed with the newest science fiction premises, the loop around plot or the various altered realities of the script, not because they're confusing but because in the end they are not much more than an emperor's proverbial new clothes. Ultimately they do not hide the writing flaws of an overly contrived wrap-it up conclusion, they do not excuse the weak and shallowly scripted subplots and they do not make the film more than a sentimental sci-fi romance. To the extent that love is profound and prevailing, this film gives us something to chew on, but not much more than, say, An Affair to Remember.In between the good and the bad, there is nothing really ugly about this film, although Elijah Wood's character, part of one of those weak and shallows, comes close. Kate Winslet's performance is respectable, although beyond the blue hair her character is not developed as much as it might have been. And the direction, with all the technical coattails is good, even if I'm not ready to burn the director's name to memory.I'll watch this film again on a rented DVD but I don't want to run out and buy it.

      "This movie was an absolute gem. However, if you don't like slightly odd films about a guy that loves a girl so much that he erases his memory, then you probably shouldn't see it. My mom couldn't sit through it.Jim Carrey plays the oddball who just climbs onto a train one day, just out of the blue. He skips his work, and heads to a beach, where he meets Kate Winslet. I can't remember what color her hair is at the time, because it changes color so many times. Anyone, after many plot twists, it turns out they've already met. Kate's character (Clementine) erased her memory of Jim's character (Joel) You can tell something is slightly wrong with Clementine, but that is besides the point. Something is obviously wrong with Joel as well. Joel finds out, and in his grief, decides to erase her memory as well. HOwever, during the process, he discovers that he can't live without her. He also discovers that Elijah Wood (Patrick) one of the people working to erase his memories stole his girlfriend after erasing her memory and stealing her underwear. Anyway, they meet back up and agree to work everything out after Kirsten Dunsts character realizes that she erased her memory of a affair with her boss, who happens to run the agency that erases the memories of both Joel and Clementine. Kirsten's character sends everyone back their memories, all of the stuff they gave to the doctor so he could make a map for which he could use to erase memories.Overall its confusing, but if you partially understood what I wrote and enjoyed it, you should see the movie. It is really, really good.\n",

      "The best thing I like about this movie is the way it is filmed. Like a confusing dream with things that don't make sense (like raining indoors) and the whole thing focusing on a few people like Clementine and the clinic staff whereas the rest of the people are distant and even faceless. Whoever thought of this obviously has spent lots of time dreaming and has understanding of conscious unconsciousness. I like this very very much as I myself have dreams almost similar to this where my surroundings are never constant and it never makes much sense.The characters are very well drawn. Joel in one hand, introverted and shy, somewhat anti-social, but \"nice\". He's a very believable person and in fact my personality is similar to his. It's his flaws that makes him so believably human in nature. His unintentional bursts of speech that hurt Clementine, his constantly depressed mood when he's without Clementine. The unconventional ways he chooses as an outlet for his emotions- colourful journals and arranging food on a plate. Joel's character is so colourful, yet believable at the same time. Clementine on the other hand, is such an exciting character that seems to be the dominating one at first, but as the film goes on we start to see flaws and weaknesses in her character but that only makes me like her even more. Her insecurity- \"Am I ugly?\". Her desire to start a family and live a less wild life despite her wild character. Her hair that constantly changes colour which I think signifies how she has not found herself yet, yet has so many exciting things to offer. Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet deliver these roles very well as well.The story itself flows very nicely as the entire operation is slowly revealed to us as the film progresses as profound changes to clear (like waking up from a dream) and we start to hope for Joel to save his memories. SPOILER------------ What I personally enjoyed very much was the part where Joel said \"goodbye\" to Clementine in the beach house. I thought it was a fantastic idea to think of, saying goodbye to someone who you will never think of again, in your head, in a dream. The concept of how there is not such thing as the \"eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\" is brilliant as well. Joel and Clementine finally find out that the obstacles they have to overcome are inevitable and necessary, and only through them, can they find happiness. Also, I like the idea of never being able to erase fate and destiny and how everything is meant to be.A very puzzling, creative, intriguing, and thought provoking film that seems more like a dream than a film. Fantastic stuff but it takes awhile to figure out. 9/10\n",

      "** HERE BE SPOILERS (AND I MEAN IT!) **(You might want to have these memories erased). Joel (Carrey) wakes up, but instead of going to his job, he goes to a cold beach in Montauk. There he meets the girl Clementine (Winslet) and they soon hit it off. It actually seems that they know each other from before. Well, they do. We get to see a previous relationship between them evolve and disintegrate, leading up to both of them having their memories of the other erased by Lacuna Inc. Enter subplot. The people working at Lacuna are very intimately involved. Secretary Mary (Dunst) has something going with technician Stan (Ruffalo). Co-worker Patrick (Wood) actually uses material handed in by Joel to woo Clementine. However, during Joel's procedure to have his memories of Clementine erased, he is having second thoughts and start to fight the procedure. He desperately wants to keep at least one memory of Clementine. But how to do? A hunt in his own mind, through all his memories ensues. And both inside and outside his mind, secrets wait to explode.This is an extremely strange movie, that needs you to actually be alert to have hope to keep track. (One tip is to keep track of Clementine's hair). I think the journey through Joel's mind was interesting, as it showed, from a unique perspective, situations were he didn't really know why he reacted the way he did. Situations were would have wanted to act differently. Situations we have all experienced. Carrey and Winslet have a nice relationship going between their characters and the entire cast is good I think. However, sometimes it was hard to really pay attention to the story while I were trying to coop with the strangeness (I was a little tired when I saw it, maybe that wasn't the best start). And the strangeness was all over. Now, don't equal strange with bad, because that is not at all how it is. But a lot of things were a little strange, or had an strange effect. All from music and sound to the plot, special effects and cuts. All in all, a very unique movie, an experience.6/10\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the latest from screen writing superstar Charlie Kaufman, may be one of the best films you'll see all year.Jim Carrey shrugs off his mannerisms to play Joel Barish, an introvert who falls in love with the flamboyant Clementine (a well-cast Kate Winslet). When the relationship ends a year later, and she has him erased from her memory at the Lacuna Clinic, he retaliates by undergoing the same procedure. While unconscious, Joel works backwards through key moments in their relationship ¬ñ trying to change the past, and the future. Meanwhile, the Clinic's employees ¬ñ perky receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst), technician Stan (Mark Ruffalo), the self-serving Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) ¬ñ face the ethical challenges of the work they do.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind can be enjoyed on many levels. It's an engaging comedy drama romance with A List actors, capably directed by Michael Gondry (director of Kaufman's Adaptation). The cast work well in ensemble and the characters, even those bereft of memories, manage to mature. Like Kaufman's sublime Being John Malkovitch, the film successfully weaves fantastical elements into the commonplace. Yet it's structurally and philosophically that the film enthralls. Eternal Sunshine uses a non-linear narrative to simulate the complexity of someone's mind, and demonstrate how memory constructs identity. ****1/2/***** stars.\n",

      "I have to say that this movie is probably the best in this century. It just keeps twisting your mind all through the 108 minutes. I can't even find words that can do justice to the movie. Michel Gondry knows exactly where he is going, he makes no mistakes, it just keeps getting better and better, the longer you get into the movie. To sum it up to those who haven't yet watched it, see it as soon as possible, and let your mind get blown away. If Jim Carrey doesn't receives any awards for his performance, is the world even more twisted then the movie.I will end by quoting Jim Carrey,: \"Why do i always falls in love with others, when they show me the least of attention.\" Absolutely magnificent, who hasn't felt that way...???\n",

      "This is one of the best movie I've seen for ages.. It shows the complexity of the human emotion with a very simple/basic story line. This movie gave me and my friends different messages/meaning for each of us about life itself... because this movie relates to many aspects of life. Sometimes we would like to erase parts of our life or run away from it, even though you manage to do so, it will haunt us back or we will regret erasing it. As Clem said, Enjoy It .... enjoy and cherish whatever memories you have and also life itself. A very good movie with a twist although some people might find it boring and slow moving especially if the could not relate to the moral of the story. The end of the story makes us wonder.... :))\n",

      "I had little to no expectations of this film when it was put into the DVD player, however, by the end of it, my brain was broken and my heart had dissolved.I looked to my friends who had been watching it with me and said: \"I don't know how to feel. I'm happy, i'm sad, i'm feeling ambivalent, i am feeling passionate, i do not feel yet i feel everything.\"There have been few movies, if any others, which have affected me in the way this film has. If you have ever had your heart broken by a lover, or lost something important to you and grieved after it, this film will make sense (in it's chaotic and sketchy way) of why it's better to have loved and lost (and remembered it) than to have not loved at all.KUDOS!

      "I've never seen a film that better embodies the \"decompression\" that one undergoes at the end of a relationship. This film is brilliantly directed, beautifully shot & edited and there is some very good writing.There are two stories here, the main one (Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet) which I consider the \"brilliant\" part and the secondary story (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo etc.). The secondary story brought this film down. It starts off great but really trails off lamely. The mind erasing people are supposed to be \"kooky\" and they are, but it's pretty forced and not funny at all and pretty pointless. Similar to Shakespeare's use of comic relief in secondary side stories, at least in S's case, the side stories had a point and were often poignant themselves. This \"comedic relief\" simply wasn't and really had no relation to the main story except that the characters interacted. Also, the numerous pot references were tiresome. That stuff is only funny to dedicated stoners and seemed incongruent to the rest of the movie.SPOILER: A truly brilliant moment comes at the end of the film when, considering whether they should stay in contact, Clementine says she will only end up getting bored and hating him for it (as if it's her pattern with men and she knows it) and Joel says OK, that's fine with him. As if his love for her is so important, he's OK with having to deal with that major, inevitable obstacle. He doesn't care. -- That's material with real depth, obviously coming from a writer who's had some life experience.There are no easy answers about love in this film, which is why it's brilliant. It really captures the complexities and wonder of relationships.\n",

      "First of all this was a film where Jim Carrey needed a hit with a dramatic role,instead of his stereo typical comedy films.My opinion, is that its his best performance of his career to date,or at least his best with a dramatic role.This is a thrilling film with wonderful performances by the lead roles, such as carrey and Kate Winslet,and brilliant supported roles with Elijah Wood,Tom wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst. Directed bt the ever eccentric Michel Gondry and with a kauffman script, it was bound to be, as people say \"different\" and it is,by far the best independent film of the year! When i first saw this film on DVD, i did not know what to expect!i found out it is a film with different elements, such as romance,drama and the occasional bit of comedy from surprisingly winslet and not carrey!I don't want to give anything away, but its simply a film about 2 people who realize love, is everything.A film that will open your eyes!Enjoy.\n",

      "I thought this movie was creative. Anyone who has been through a break-up can appreciate this film! It presents a good idea (erasing the mind), but teaches you at the end that memories--even the bad ones--- are essential for you to grow. The movie is not a particularly happy movie because at the end, you already know what their destiny is.Jim Carrey has improved on his serious side of acting although as usual there were those silly parts when the comedian came out. Kate Winslet looked fab even with the crazy colored hair.BTW, if you watch it a second time around, you catch things that you didn't get the first time.\n",

      "Charlie Kauffman has once again dumbfounded me with his ability to capture the strange but true things about this world and the humans that live on it.The Eternal Sunshine is without a doubt his best work yet (yes, even better than Being John Malchovich and Adaptation.) while using Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in a mind boggling drama that actually puts you inside someone else's dreams. This, by far, was Jim Carrey's best acting job yet and should definitely be up for Best Actor for his stunning performance. But though this film was superb in every way, it isn't for everyone. If you're not into the whole \"play with your mind\" thing, I wouldn't take the time to watch this one. But nonetheless, this movie is the most touching and gripping film I have ever seen.\n",

      "I really loved this movie, as I loved \"Being John Malkovich\". I was very surprised however to discover that some of my friends found it utterly boring... For me is a 10 out of 10.One scene puzzled me though: Jim and Kate are talking to each other in Kate's bookstore, where the books have blank covers. She is reproaching him about \"his marriage\". What marriage? The only marriage man in the movie seems to be the scientist in charge of Lacuna. I found certain similarities with Philip K. Dick's story \"We can remember it for you wholesale\", which inspired the movie \"Total recall\" (1990). For anybody interested in the possibility of playing with memories, I warmly recommend reading this great story, whereas the film is rather weak in my opinion. Also a wonderful Spanish movie, \"Open your eyes\", by Alejandro Amenabar (the maker of \"The others\") goes in that direction. This movie was poorly remade in the US with the title \"Vanilla sky\" (keeping from the original version the Spanish Penelope Cruz, who met there Tom Cruise and became his fianc√©e, while Nicole Kidman was shooting with said Amenabar \"The others\"... )\n",

Full marks to Jim Carrey for his performance - Shows he can do a lot more than just slapstick. I thought all the cast was well selected and all gave a good performance.

      "I've watched several hundred movies in the past three years and haven't felt the need to write many reviews at IMDb.com, but for some reason I feel the need to defend this movie. Why that is I am uncertain, particularly since less than 10 percent of the ratings for this movie have been below a \"7\". But those who hate it...man do they ever seem to hate it.First of all, there are several reviewers who merely decided to say this movie was \"crap\", with no thought or reasoning as to why that is. They are irrelevant until they are willing to defend their opinion. Of those who pointed out specific deficiencies, nearly all of them were--in my opinion--incorrect. The editing? That's the style of this movie. If it isn't your cup of tea that's fine, but to act as though it was unprofessional of the editor is ridiculous. The acting? You must be joking. It's a wonderful cast, and in my opinion they are in top form. And you have never seen Kate Winslet and seldom seen Jim Carrey doing anything like this. Not original? Again, you must be joking. For god's sake, it has Charlie Kaufman's name on it and that's about all you need to know. Below average for Kaufman? I think that it's every bit as good a script as \"Being John Malkovich\" or \"Adaptation\"--but I feel that this is a better movie than either of those. Not funny? There are a few laughs, but I'm unsure why this movie was ever classified a \"comedy\" in the first place. However, I don't think a movie is *required* to be funny, just good. Hard to follow? I knew little about the premise before watching the movie and had no trouble following it; that wasn't the case with several other movies I could name. If you listen before the opening credits when it's made clear that what is taking place happened on \"Valentine's Day 2004\", it helps immensely (although unless I am remembering something incorrectly, that would rather strangely constitute playing hooky from an office job on Saturday).What this movie qualifies as is a particularly original romance. And the healthy dose of skepticism and reality toward romance that are thrown in the mix (particularly at the end) doesn't detract from that at all. That's quite an accomplishment to me. It's worthy of one of the few \"10\" ratings I'll ever give on IMDb.com. And of the hundred or so movies I've seen from the 21st Century, I can't think of a better one. If it isn't up for Best Picture, AMPAS will have made yet another major blunder.\n",

      "Not at all what I expected, both Jim Carey and Kate Winslett are amazing in this twisted story that investigates the interplay between the mind, emotion and medical science. Carey slinks about, the embodiment of unhappiness and confusion, barely alive except when with Winslett. She, on the other hand, bubbles with energy and curiosity. Both seem made for their roles. Dunst, too, is excellent as the officiously sexy receptionist and Elijah Woods,in a role that couldn't be further from the innocent hero,Frodo Baggins, allows us a glimpse into the mind of one who perceives himself as desperately inadequate - his superficial attempts to create a relationship through mimicry contrasting with the attempt to superficially destroy one that is real. The obvious similarities between this film and \"Being John Malkovitch\" have undoubtedly been pointed out, but frankly, I prefer this one despite its solemness. This is a study in both ethics and metaphor by which one can't help but be disturbed. I loved it!\n",

Kate Winslet's character was a walking horror. I've known a lot of people like her and sadly, not enough of them are dead.5. No one else in this movie did one thing that made the slightest bit of sense. They're not characters, they're plot contrivances. Lone exception: the wife of the man who ran the clinic. The scene where she confronted her husband was the only honest moment in this film.5.5. Okay, the lighting was gorgeous, and the special effects were pretty good. But if the lighting is the best thing in your movie, then your movie really sucks.Final analysis: I still hate Jim Carrey. I now loathe Charlie Kaufman.

      "I sincerely do not understand what the buzz about this film is about. Charlie Kaufman's story is based upon the idea of erasing memory and the way it affects relationship and love. For science-fiction fans the idea of memory manipulation is not that original at all. Recently the 'Bounty' series or 'Paycheck' brought it to the big screen, and did it in a more attractive way, leading to good action films. The relationship story in 'Eternal Sunshine...' is rather banal, and even Kaufman could not resist to a quite routine ending. A lot of screen time is spent into simulating the effect of memory erasing, but I found much of it not-inspired and artificial. Jim Carrey is mis-casted, he wears a monkey grimace much of the film that let me ask how he could raise the emotional interest of Kate Winslet. Kate is better than Jim, while Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst do good supporting roles. Overall, I did not find the film too interesting, it's just fair entertainment that tries but does not succeed to be something else. I cannot share the enthusiasm of many other viewers about it, and gave it a 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.\n",

The heroine's performance is tarnished and not convincing. Jim is great, sometimes making me laugh so loud. But sometimes did not speak clearly enough. Elijah Wood is mediocre as usual. In my opinion, he is more suitable for a role of goody-goody, instead of this one. \"Eternal sunshine of spotless mind\" is nothing special. Only watch it to kill time. I have not understood why it get a high rate yet, since I could easily give a very long list to beat it.\n",

That's gonna be hard.This is a film that rates as many things... it's sci-fi, it's a love story, it's a little funny (although not as much as you'd expect from a film with Jim Carey in it.. although this IS one of his better roles). (BTW: If you're in the UK and watch Emerdale (I don't ... but mah siblings do) - look out for J.C.'s hair cut! LOL) Anyhow. It's a very good look at the way we see things, and pick on faults, and at times arbitrarily decide the things that we think we would be better off not knowing.There's innumerable films with some government or other being responsible for hiding the truth... but what if you've decided for yourself? Are you always in the right frame of mind to MAKE that decision for yourself? Would you let a child decide for itself what it thought was a reasonable risk? It's a bit of an eye opener.Is short: It's a film about two people who may/may not be in love. They decide to erase the other from their mind... to \"forget\" it ever happened. And although we only see Careys side of the experience (a good think the way we see it pan out), we can assume that the other would have been along the same tracks.It's not an action movie, and there's no lasers, no blatant SFX (They're there, but they are no, thank god, for once the center of attention in a sci fi flick) it's just a dammed good film that explores many aspects of how things come to be what they are.There's a good layering of one story on top of another on top of another.. and it's a fantastic cry to the days when decent science fiction was more a study of how one advancement would influence PEOPLE, than how it's a study of how many ships can be fit into one frame all firing their guns at once!If you like a bit of a mushy film... and you like a film that invokes deep thought, and a film that reminds you of what you may need to go through to be happy - without the need for once of a definitive hero... this is it.Don't knock this one until you have seen it. And if you do see it and still don't like it.. hell! Watch it again with an open mind.\n",

The idea of it all is better in theory than in the practise of watching it. It left me empty and the only feeling I had was to register on IMDb to post a comment on it (my first ever!). I was expecting a lot from this film and all I got was sense I had just watched a collection of memories, sometimes randomly put together, none of which we're really that interesting.I would rate it 5/10 and say it was a major missed opportunity.

There is so much to enjoy of this film, starting with the incredible idea of someone who is willing to erase some of his memories in a company call Lacuna Inc., then there is the love story (so new and fresh like no other since Punch Drunk Love)and finally the visual contest between the mind of Joel and the company guys that are trying to erase all his memories of Clementine.So sad and yet so lovable, this story has many awesome dialogue lines that theorize about the live in couple, the inner problems of individualism, the ethics of the man manipulating the nature and the minds in order to make it profitable and others that I can recall right now. I was so happy to go see this movie with all the hopes to be intelectually challenge and just get what I wanted, this is a work done by people with the creativity and the will to do some meaning, a product that gives a good earned credit to its audience from the begining, if you haven¬¥t see it WHAT ARE YOU WAITING?

The film takes a while to build up, but when it did, goddamn, it blew me away! With a combo of drama, love story, and a touch of sci-fi all rolled into a slightly wacky package, this movie is one of the best in recent years.Stellar acting -- best performances I've ever seen by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and nice showing by Elijah Wood as Patrick (completely un-Frodo like!). I always like Jim and Kate but in this film they really shone -- for once not typecast, they show their tremendous talent. Overall, the acting is fantastic.The time sequence of the movie is a bit convoluted which creates a very interesting puzzle and storyline for the viewer. In general I like non-chronological time lines in movies and this film did it particularly well because it was NOT overdone -- just enough so that you couldn't quite tell if it was chronological or not until towards the end.Much of the movie takes place in Jim Carrey's (Joel's) mind, which is fascinating and reminiscent at times of Being John Malkovich (screenplay was written by the same guy, Charlie Kaufman I believe) -- especially during memory sequences that went back to Joel's childhood.*** SPOILER The film wasn't a happy one though it does have a good ending; but while usually I don't like depressing movies, I was truly moved by this one.

      "A unique problem arises when a movie tries to separate itself from your average, run-of-the-mill film: When too many other movies make the same attempt, it becomes anything but unique. Such seems to be the problem for \"Eternal Sunshine\". The storyline seems almost formulaicly fractured, in a way that what should be a confusing and misleading transition become as easy to detect as a simple scene change. Plot twists seem to be forced in at exactly the moments you would expect them, effectively draining them of all weight.This aside, the story is often very compelling. It is all too easy to relate to the frustration of the main characters, even though the circumstances are pure science fiction. All said, this is a very enjoyable movie that suffers a little from structural elements and poor plot twists.\n",

      "'Eternal Sunshine' is another brain-bending riddle from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. I didn't like 'Being John Malkovich' or 'Adaptation,' but I thought 'Eternal Sunshine' was really a good movie. Long, but good.This is a movie with an interesting concept: how do people deal with bad situations? Here, a company offers permanent repression of memory.The story focuses on Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), two people who awkwardly meet and fall in love (I suppose). But, their lack of communication skills prevents any sort of meaningful relationship. Over time, they grow weary of other.This are the most interesting, surrealistic scenes and once that force to you realize that everything you're seeing about Joel was a memory or something erased from his memory (pay close attention when you watch it again to the beginning scenes prior to Joel's going to the clinic).During the latter part of the memory wipe, Joel starts to concentrate on all the good times that he and Clementine had, realizing that he is still in love with her. And the latter part of the memory wipe is Joel trying to manipulate his memories to hide them from the fast sweep of the memory wipe process. Essentially, he tries to manipulate his memories and save Clementine in another part of his brain. It is like Atreyu being chased by the Nothing and salvaging what he can of Fantasia. Joel is salvaging what he can of Clementine and in the end, memory wipe doesn't seem like the best solution afterall (although, Joel probably would've gone for a technique that just wiped out the bad and kept the good). But the interesting part is the finale. Because, these people continue to have their memory wiped again and again (making it one wealthy enterprise, no less). Although, what I don't understand is why would those people keep doing exactly the same thing that led up to meeting that other person (or doing whatever it was the they had erased). Would Joel jump on the train to Montauk (something that seemed out of the ordinary at the time, anyway) every day after he got his memory wiped? So, even as an old man getting his memory erased for the umpteenth time, would he be compelled to go on the train to Montauk and start all over again? It seems pretty stupid.Though this movie is somewhat long, given that you're forced to follow Joel through every single damned memory of Clementine, the repetition is somewhat alleviated by this surrealistic journey until the whole thing becomes so totally bizarre and the situation for Joel so desperate. In the end, the movie suggests that it is more painful to try to ignore everything (and very counterproductive), instead of just trying to face those problems. It seems like Joel and Clementine, two eccentrics, seem really happy together when things are going well. If they just would've honestly confronted their problems, they wouldn't need the memory, and they'd have probably been a couple that was well off for as long as they could be (not to say that happy endings last forever). Kaufman's surrealistic style strikes gold here, as does a pretty fantastic cast. Especially, Jim Carrey proves he doesn't have to overact to do well. Although, I must say Elijah Wood does take yet another weird part as Patrick, the lab assistant, who tries to steal Joel's identity in order to woo Clementine. But, the whole movie is really Carrey and Winslet.\n",

      "i totally disagree that it is the worst movie. this is a movie that stands right in between the boundaries of artistic and mainstream movie. those who aren't able to actually grasp the beauty of it should not slam it. those who are looking for a story line, forget it. this movie is about emotions, and it explores emotions far more than the feelings one can experience in life due to its injections of sci-fic flavor. it is like letting a person who only knows french to read Chinese. of course it is difficult to appreciate unless the person is slowly exposed to more artistic forms of movie. i applaud Jim Carey's efforts to venture into a new form of movie with interjections of comedy, i recommend everyone to look at the quotes in the IMDb. it is very meaningful and i feel this movie is definitely a marvelous production, especially the scriptwriter.\n",

      "I have seen Adaptation, which is also by Kaufman, and I couldn't believe that someone who shows himself as being completely unable to maintain or even begin to have a relationship, could understand and illustrate the finest detail of relationships.I was both frightened by the thought of losing memory of anyone I loved but I was also filled with joy when I realized that pure, true love that is out of our control can exist.I have written a comment on Adaptation and posted it on IMDb. I found Eternal... to be very similar in style. Very sleek but highly detailed. I think that there was a greater focus on subconscious or subliminal thought in this film. For example: Joel talks about how Clementine is not the type of person that he can talk to about books, he says this in a conscious, analytical state. But a lot of his memories and safety zones involving Clementine are associated with books and book shelves and stores. Strange our reality can warp ones true emotions.I haven't been able to think about the film properly because I saw it recently, but would like to discuss this film more.\n",

      "Consciously or not, Hollywood often concurrently releases a number of films that treat similar subjects. Last year, the common thread was the defence of the family home. This year, it is memory and its erosion, in a line that runs through 50 First Dates, Paycheck, and now Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. With its science-fiction trappings ¬ñ a man (Jim Carrey) decides to have all memory of his ex-girlfriend (Kate Winslet) erased from his brain ¬ñ Sunshine threatens to be one of those gimmicky, what-if movies (Witness Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451: what if all books were banned and we had to memorise them in order to keep literature alive? The film itself is flat: the premise is everything.) Thankfully, the film is more interested in how our sense of identity relies on what we remember.Carrey has ¬ñ who would have thought it ¬ñ a gentle presence here, as befits a man whose brain has just been re-formatted. His face is no longer rubbery, flip: ruffled, unshaven, it has never seemed so lived-in, with a crease in one cheek. He has a touching hesitancy. The film begins with one of writer Charlie Kaufman's trademark mumbles, an obsessive monologue full of insecurities and minor detail. Carrey plays hooky from work, goes on an impromptu holiday. There he meets Clementine (Winslet). Their first meeting is awkward: like most of Kaufman's men, Joel Barish is a bit of a stiff. Clementine tries to stand out by surrounding herself with oddball details ¬ñ she has dolls made out of potatoes, and her hair changes colour every five minutes. Winslet has an aggression here that keeps her from being merely whimsical. We see why she is with Carrey: Clementine feels more wild and free by contrast. He needs her prodding.SPOILER ALERTThe film really begins once the couple split. Anyone who, post break-up, has ever done something rash will understand the impulse to delete an offending ex. While Carrey is in bed, two technicians (Mark Ruffalo, with tousled hair and a sleepy drawl, and Elijah Wood) call on his house and erase those parts of his brain that store memories of Clementine. \"It's a controlled form of brain damage,\" says presiding doctor Tom Wilkinson, \"but no worse than a night of heavy drinking.\" Much of Sunshine is set in Joel's brain: we relive his memories as they begin to vanish. The details are sucked out of existence, and they begin to have the confusing blankness of a nightmare. Michel Gondry is a whiz at weird, dreamlike distortions of space and time. The slats of a picket fence disappear one by one. Faces become blank, lose their identifying marks. In one scene, Joel careers to and fro down a single street, always ending back at his car. All this happens very fast: there is an exhilarating sense of invention.\n",

      "First of all, if you like to go to the movies to unwind aka no-brain- activities-possible, then don't watch this movie. You'll get confused and you'll miss what is so wonderful about this movie. But it does not take a genius to appreciate this movie cos I'm not!This movies hits home real hard especially to those who had experienced relationship that had turn sour. That is the time when you wish you knew Dr Howard to help you erase the memory of it all. This movie tries makes bring you to the other side and let you see the effect of actually having that done and put the choice back in your hands. Of course if you've met a monster, then go ahead and get that procedure but sometimes relationship turns sour because of many ridiculous things that when accumulated gives the impression that it was 'horrible'.This movie if compared to '21 Grams' is nothing in terms of the timeline sequence. It is pretty much a) the present day and b) the past which keeps going backwards. It does brings you back and forth (that was the whole point of the movie) but that was not the main reason that makes it wonderfully intelligent. It's how it was nicely packaged. Carrey was great. He is a good actor. There's classic Carrey for a while in this movie (which cracks me up real good) and he actually remains the same throughout but the difference is that we do not feel like laughing at him. He has shown that you need not have a Deniro face to show that you're seriously acting and it worked. Winslet as usual, a good actor she is does perfectly well as a devil-may-care Clementine.There are only 5 main characters in this movie and it was more than enough. Each and everyone of them are important that even though Woods character has the least amount of lines, this movie cannot do without him.My review may not help in helping you make a choice to watch this movie or not because I don't want to give anything away. You have to watch it yourself. A must watch, trust me.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is unlike any other movie I have ever seen or experienced. It's really really good, draws you in, and I don't want to say too much here to give it away or detract from its goodness and status as a film and experience. Best in its first viewing, and I'll watch it many many many many many times again. My favorite movie of all time (and I feel very safe in saying that it will remain my favorite movie for my entire life). Go see it - go see it. Go see it. Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski are two people that are...well, once again, go see it. Oh, I almost forgot - man - the soundtrack of this movie is amazingly good! Beck's \"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime\", E.L.O.'s \"Mr. Blue Sky\", the Polyphonic Spree's \"Light and Day\", are all great, especially Beck's tune. But the movie music is truly unique and a part of the movie that is indistinguishable from the film as a whole.\n",

      "SPOILERSFrom the start, let me just say that I'm an enormous fan of Charlie Kaufman. I can't say what it is about the guy which I enjoy so much, but in both \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\" he created two films which whilst are VERY obscure, are simultaneously brilliant. In fact, the one criticism I do have for Kaufman is one which is often repeated. The problem with Kaufman is that often he isn't particularly good at conclusions. Don't get me wrong, his conclusions are often above average, but compared with the rest of the film, they're disappointments. With this in mind I was intrigued to see what he would do with \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\". I've seen some criticisms, I've seen a lot of praise, personally I love it.In this film we are introduced to Joel Barish (Jim Carrey). Joel is basically useless. He has negligible people skills, doesn't express himself and just doesn't seem to fit into life. Suddenly one day he is introduced to Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). \"Clem\" is an outgoing hippy style of person who teaches Joel about life and together they begin a relationship. At some point however, things inevitably go wrong and after learning of a technique to remove memories (already used by Clementine), Joel figures he is better off without her. This leads to a unique and often obscure trip through Joel's subconscious as his mind is purged of his love.In \"Eternal Sunshine Of A Spotless Mind\", Kaufman has continued a run of form. I'll confess I've never seen \"Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind\", but his films I have seen I've adored. In this piece, Kaufman presents a beautiful trip through the human mind and into the world of memory. In a few scenes where he is unable to remember faces, they fade into blurred focus, exactly as in the real mind. As Joel travels through his mind, we experience his entire relationship with Clementine, reasons for it's collapse and we even experience earlier moments in his life.I'll admit that this film is not perfect. Others might disagree, others might condemn the film itself more, but personally at times it felt like it dragged slightly. When the titles came up and I left, I did feel emotional and awe struck. In effect Kaufman produced a good ending for once. The problem however is that there ARE times during this film when it doesn't seem to progress too much. It's a film easily worthy of the IMDb top 250, however the mid 40's feels perhaps slightly too high.I have no doubt this is a film I'll one day buy on DVD, in fact I look forward to it. This film reminds us of how we should always embrace every moment and how the good can sometimes mix with the bad. In the long run though, despite amazing pieces by Carrey & Winslet, I don't feel myself connecting with their relationship enough. Carrey is amazing as the withdrawn Joel, as is Winslet as Clementine, ultimately though, in their real relationship (not the Clementine, Joel creates in his mind) they feel at odds with each other and don't appear to click.In conclusion then, this film is brilliant. It's by no stretch of the imagination perfect, but a few flaws does not prevent it from being yet another Kaufman piece of beauty which affects it's viewing audience. If you haven't seen this film yet, then go watch it straight away.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman has another hit on his hands here, with a sprawling and unusual screenplay about two characters who 'erase' each other from their minds, only to find what they were searching for in the first place.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are not my favourite film actors by any means but they both turn in performances which fit within the weird fabric of this story.  Carrey plays Joel, a misfit who doesn't entirely fit with the world; Winslet plays Clementine, with unusual hair and ideas.  They fit clumsily together.  The process of erasing any memory of someone completely from the brain raises a number of interest questions: would anyone want *any* memory to be completely wiped?  Can the technique be used for purposes of abuse?  What does the brain really retain as 'a memory'?  The nature and depth of relationships with others is also examined within the chaos of images which move backwards and forwards, into vague and defined memory, and between reality and fantasy.The film is cleverly put together, both funny and perceptive, and I'm glad to say, very good.\n",

      "I have already pretty much blanked this movie out of my mind.  I do remember a little bit of it still, before I walked out.  I've never done that before, by the way, and I like many different types of movies.  What I do remember is that I couldn't really care less whether Kate Winslett's and Jim Carey's characters stayed with each other or not.  I don't really recall any big love forming between them before the first time she went to have him erased from her memory.  I didn't find the \"memory-erasing\" idea fascinating at all.  I went with another person, and we both hated it, but we have decided that since so many people seem to like it, we will probably check it out when it is available for rental and try to make it through to the end. Maybe something happened after that awful first hour that will make us change our minds. Somehow, I don't think so, but I usually love Jim Carey's movies, so I will try to keep an open mind.\n",

      "I am amazed at the praise being put upon this movie not only here on this web site but reviews in the newspapers. Jim Carrey does a decent performance allowing us to see a serious and dark side to him.  Some of the special effects were pretty cool.  Overall, I got bored with the movie and that was when I wasn't irritated by the timeline jumping back and forth, the hard to follow sequence of events and a general lack of interest in the characters. The biggest question might be why in the world did Carrey and Winslet's characters get involved in the first place.  There wasn't enough chemistry between them nor enough background to make us care about them.\n",

      "Let me start by saying it is a long time since I have been totally entranced by a film, that I have been delighted, intellectually stimulated; hopeful, as I've seen there is a storyteller who can smartly tell a tale relevant to everyday life, timeless in theme and yet sensitive and nuanced in addressing concerns that are uniquely modern.Hey, I liked it!Kaufman, Gondry and the very strong ensemble cast have created a real work of art. All great Art comes from the Human Quest for Love. Who doesn't find love difficult? Faith, trust, hope intertwined... all elemental concerns of the Heart... There are many ways to fail and succeed in the quest for these eternal verities, but modernity provides us new ways to frustrate ourselves in pursuit of them... and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind shows us that despite the overwhelming power of our culture that can both save and harm us, connect and separate us...Humanity can, with a leap of faith, maybe, save themselves...\n",

      "Now this is truly amazing. Writer Charlie Kaufman wrote a comedy that I didn't find overrated. Although I really liked Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, his one straight drama, Being John Malkovich had no place to go and Adaptation. had something missing to it. But Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a genius creation. Not only is it his funniest movie, but it's also the most coherent and most enjoyable movie.Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Director Michel Gondry (who worked previously with Kaufman on Human Nature) found a way to not only have the movie make sense, but to have some striking visuals (barely any, if any, that were done by computer fx) thrown in, also. For the most part, we see what is going on in Joel's mind as Clementine is being erased, so it's always interesting to see what will happen. The story, although a certain subplot seemed unnecessary, flowed together nicely, and, although told out of sequence, made perfect sense. That made no sense, but you'll understand it if you see the movie.I wouldn't say Carrey put his most subtle work here (that honor goes to The Truman Show), but he did do a good job, and, as I have heard, is a VERY early Oscar contender for next year. That I doubt, but it will be interesting to watch. Winslet (who has faded from her Titanic stardom) is also quite good. However, the supporting cast, including Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Tom Wilkinson, leave something to be desired. They don't seem to really want to be in this movie as much as the others do.Overall, Eternal Sunshine is a surprising film. It's surprisingly funny, surprisingly entertaining, surprisingly dramatic, and, most of all, surprisingly easy to follow.My rating: 9/10Rated R for language and some drug and sexual content.\n",
      "847\n",
      "You can add Charlie Kaufman to the list of names (Hitler, Michael Jackson, Dr. Seuss) of people whom I never want to know what is going on in their own little minds.  As a writer of such films as Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Human Nature, the slant to which this man sees the world is somewhat out of my comprehension.  Not that that's a bad thing.   David Cronenberg continues to create films that amaze me with his vivid worlds of sex, violence and the creatures that lurk in the dark, but I rarely turn down an opportunity to sit through one of his fascinating films.   Now, Charlie Kaufman releases his next foray into his mind-bending filmography with the poorly titled Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The film, stars Jim Carrey as Joel, a mild mannered polite recluse that meats Clementine (Kate Winslet), a free spirited outgoing alcoholic.  The two spark up a relationship that lasts the better part of a year before falling apart over a harsh conversation one cold New York day. \n",
      "Wanting to rid herself of the memory of Joel, Clementine seeks the help of Dr. Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson) who operates a business that can remove selected memories in a non-surgical operation that is ¬ëon-line with a night of heavy drinking'.  The movie then follows Joel as he fights the procedure and tries to retain the happier times within the relationship. \n",
      "The story as summarized in a single paragraph seems simple enough, but with the Kaufman slant thrown in, it is anything but.  We watch as Joel plays cat and mouse with the doctors working on his unconscious body and watch as Joel's dreams and memories begin to disappear before him.  Imagine your most vivid memory then conceive of it being stripped from you element by element. The house you were in disappears. The people you knew vaporize. Fences or other structures dissolve as if never erected.  You run, but it follows you relentlessly erasing everything one step behind you.  You try and hide in a suppressed memory, but the procedure is a success and soon these experiences will be nothing more than a file in a doctor's office.Exhausting.Now, throw in a few sub-plots to further mess with your mind.  There is the doctors' assistant, Patrick (Elijah Wood) who falls in love with Clementine and uses Joel's memories to woo her into a romance.  There is also the love story between Dr. Mierzwaik, his wife, his secretary (Kristin Dunst) and assistant (Mark Ruffalo) that is too complicated and quirky to reveal here. Each of these play out during the 108 minute running time and are as non-conventional ideas as any of Kaufman's work.  So, verdict time.  I am beginning to think that Charlie Kaufman might be the Martin Scorsese of our day.  See back in the 80's and 90's, Scorsese was able to get the best out of his actors and actresses and was able to provide an Oscar winning role to Paul Newman and a nomination to Sharon Stone. Anyone who can pull off this feat deserves credit.  Well, Kaufman should be no less regarded.  Catherine Keener pulled out a nomination for Being John Malkovich and Nicholas Cage was robbed of an Oscar for his duel role in Adaptation.  We can now add Jim Carrey to the list of actors that have proven their best following the written words of Mr. K.  By acting low key, without having us think he is being restrained, Carrey finally shows us the range he tried in other dramatic fare such as Man on the Moon and The Majestic.  The supporting cast, especially Dunst as the toke-smoking assistant are equally impressive.Oh yeah, the verdict.  Spotless Mind is not for all tastes, but in keeping an open frame, it might just end up on some critics ¬ëbest of' lists at years end.  Who wouldn't want to have a memory erased?  The loss of a pet, your most humiliating moment.  Kaufman exploits that notion and eventually shows us that each experience is there for a purpose, and good or bad, they make you what you are today.   This film challenged me into thinking of what I would dispose of within my own noggin and then further brought me to thinking as to whether I would regret the procedure.    I left the theatre without an answer, and aren't those the best kind of films of all? B+www.gregrants.com\n",

I haven't seen Kate Winslet too many films and i liked her here but she was better in Heavenly Creatures.

      "Normally `high concept' films are big budget Hollywood movies with big stars that are easy to market because of a one sentence pitch idea.  For instance, the new Jim Carrey film could be summarized as: After falling for a flamboyant outgoing partier, a shy recluse has her memory erased after the relationship goes bad, but then realizes he doesn't want to let her memory go.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which follows this idea, may seem like a high concept film, with the big star Jim Carrey and the easy to pitch storyline, but it is anything but a Hollywood clich√©d movie.  This is, in all essence, a Charlie Kaufman film.  And either you're going to get it and love it, or you're not and think it's pretentious and boring; I of course am the former.I label Eternal Sunshine a Charlie Kaufman film, rather than a Michel Gondry film (the director) because: A) a screenwriter rarely gets the credit he deserves, and B) the three films from original screenplays by Kaufman that I've seen [I missed Human Nature, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is an adaptation] all have similar characteristics, like the three main characters-Joel in Eternal Sunshine, Craig in Being John Malkovich, and himself in Adaptation-are all neurotic loners with a lot of the same idiosyncrasies, that wish they could be someone else or have a need for change in their life.  Yet despite the similarities, each screenplay seems fresh and new because the writing is so creative and inventive.  And whether it's Gondry or Spike Jonze directing, the idea and the creativity is from Kaufman.***SPOILER/PLOT SUMMARY***Eternal Sunshine opens with a 15 minute segment (before the opening credits), where we meet Joel Barish (Carrey), with his voice over narration, and learn he's a loner and writes his thoughts in a journal.  He's obviously unhappy and calls in sick to work to go to the beach, and with his luck, it's a gloomy day at the beach.  There he sees a girl, Clementine Kruczynski (Winslet), and eventually she comes up to him on the train home.  They hit it off at her persistence, and it appears they are beginning a relationship. Soon we learn that appearances, and memories, can be deceiving.\n",
      "Both Joel and Clementine have gone to Lacuna, Inc. to have the memory of their relationship erased.  And without fully knowing it at first, we join Joel, after the opening, while Lacuna is erasing Clementine from his memory.\n",
      "What's quite brilliant about this film is it doesn't set out to explain everything, to spoon-feed the plot; it lets you figure things out as you go along.  There isn't much of a conventional narrative structure; at times it feels disjointed, elusive, much like Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's 21 Grams. But that's what is so great.  Like 21 Grams, this is a film that makes you think.There are also little things that really add to the script.  `Lacuna', the name of the memory erasure company, means an empty space or a missing part. At one point when Joel enters Lacuna bringing materials from his relationship with Clementine, there is an old lady in the waiting room with her box of stuff that includes a dog bone and food dish, indicating she is there to have her memory of her dead dog removed.***MORE SPOILERS***It's also interesting to see how the final film changed from the first draft of the screenplay, available at www.beingcharliekaufman.com.  The first draft contained book ends, where Mary (Dunst) as an old lady brought in a manuscript to Random House in the beginning, stating it was something very important that needed to be published.  Then at the end, it comes back to her, and we learn Joel and Clementine have been erasing their relationship over and over again for the past 30 or so years.  The book ends were cut, which is good, because the film emerges you right into Joel's life.Focus Features, the main company who produced and is distributing Eternal Sunshine, is on the forefront of releasing cutting edge independent films. Some of their past films include 21 Grams, Lost in Translation, Swimming Pool, The Shape of Things, The Pianist, and Far From Heaven.  Like those other risky ventures, again they are taking quite a risk with Eternal Sunshine.This is not a Jim Carrey movie as we know it; this is not the Jim Carrey we know.  This isn't even a comedy.  I equate Carrey's performance in Eternal Sunshine, and the transformation he has made from his regular comedic performances, to that of Bill Murray's dramatic turn in Lost in Translation.\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine is a lot like Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love in the way he used Adam Sandler in a different type of comedy, and it paid off there, just like it pays off here.  But I wonder if the audience will think so, as Punch-Drunk really didn't do all that well, because it was so different, because people weren't used to a beautifully shot character driven romantic dark comedy that didn't star Sandra Bullock or Jennifer Lopez.Eternal Sunshine is even more fully realized than Punch-Drunk though, as Punch-Drunk was a bit lacking on Lena the love-interest character. Eternal Sunshine is Kaufman's most fully realized screenplay to date, that develops all the characters, even the minor ones like Mary, Dr. Mierzwiak, Stan and Patrick.My hope is the audience will live up to the challenge of Eternal Sunshine, because it's a challenge worth taking, a challenge that makes you think about relationships, about memories good and bad, and about life.Alternative Recommendations:  Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, The Cable Guy, Heavenly Creatures, The Virgin Suicides, Punch-Drunk Love\n",

      "I like Jim Carrey whether he's playing a goofy lawyer who can't lie (Liar, Liar) or a blacklisted Hollywood writer who cracks not one joke throughout the movie (The Majestic). I also enjoy movies with circuitous plot lines. That being said, I was very excited to see this movie but missed it in theaters in 2004.Now that I've seen it, I'm glad I didn't waste the $8.50 for theater admission five years ago. This film confuses and disappoints from start to finish and left me totally disoriented with a mild headache...no joke.Carrey's performance is so involved in the character you feel his depression, sadness, and lack of passion for life oozing through the screen and infiltrating your own being. As for Kate Winslet, I hold no grudge against her for her role in 'Titanic' but I found her completely insufferable and annoying in this film. Perhaps she's a reminder of girls I'd like to forget in my own life.Feel free to see this movie but I still don't recommend it.\n",

Being a fan of quality and entertaining movies I don't rate Eternal sunshine at all. If however you enjoy artistic movies I would consider this as an 8 out of 10.

I wish a method like this to forget things will come in the future. Would be so extremely helpful for people who have been through something horrible like a crime, war etc. But it would be hard to distinguish who would genuinely need it and who just didn't realize the seriousness of this method. But I guess the profits would be greater than the risks. I don't give so much details about what I think about the movie because that isn't of any use for anyone.

      "Of all the movies that delve into relationship drama, none expose the raw energy and emotion to this level for me. Conceptually intriguing and cinematically inventive, \"Eternal Sunshine\" is truly an deep adventure into the magnetism and torture of interpersonal relationships. Kate Winslet is absolutely brilliant as the cuckoo girlfriend and Jim Carey' characters vulnerability lets us feel his decision more than explain it. With a soundtrack that is perfectly quirky and timed exquisitely, this is a thinking and feeling film, and draws out compassion for the concept of relationships. The vehicle of specific memory erasing is done through editing genius and cinema magic and is a fascinating study all in itself. It openly acknowledges that we hinder our possible success due to failures of our pasts which the bittersweet ending sheds light on.\n",

The memories make your existence, without out them you are someone, something else...I feel terrible for those victims of Alzheimer's and the family and friends that it affects.If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out.

I seem to stand somewhere in between...The performance of the actors is astonishing. Winslet is great, but that's no surprise. Carey on the other hand was blowing me away with his subtle approach... i did not see that coming from a guy that was \"the mask\".It is sure a beautiful movie, but i think a part of the attraction to it is that it is not a typical Hollywood movie. It is free from any romantic clich√©s that usually get served to us when two famous actors play the \"fall in love\"-thing. The movie unfolds mixing a Hollywood-unknown realism with a Hollywood-unknown surrealism. It's like having a joint: if you expect to be blown away, then nothing will happen. But if you relax and let it get to you, then you might enjoy it.Still: The movie obviously hasn't had the same effect that it had on most other people. It reminded me a little to my first relationship (with a different ending). But maybe that's what it's supposed to be. A sorta teenage-style \"first love\" story told with mid-30ies people. It feels like a nostalgic picture of my idea of love when i was about 16, but stuffed with people of my age, so i can easier relate. To me that just doesn't feel honest. I did not think i'd ever say that, but i feel pretty grown up after watching this.Pretty much everybody in one way or the other doesn't want to grow up. If love is the thing where you don't want to mature in (or just how it was when you weren't), then take a look at this one. I couldn't get the hang of the naivety of the protagonists.\n",

      "* * * * (Excellent)I admit, I'm a tough critic who is rarely impressed by current and recent films from Hollywood. Rarely a film comes about with an outstanding and very original story. This is such a film. I'm viewing and critiquing this film four years after it's theatrical release. I was aware of the critical acclaim for this film before viewing it.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004), is an exceptionally intelligent, sensitive, romantic and honest film about memories and falling in and out of love. This film has a very complicated story that frequently jumps around in time. I wasn't paying complete enough attention the first viewing and so viewed it a second time, when I picked up on critical moments I missed the first time, especially a critical line of dialog that really links and help make sense of the complicated story. The story of this film is told as a \"mobius strip\", that wraps around and connects back to itself. I was not familiar with the origin of the title of this film. My first impression was the title is intriguing and poetic.The story concerns a man having his memory erased of a woman he recently had a stormy romantic relationship with. He is using a supposed medical treatment that can selectively erase unpleasant or troublesome memories. My brief story description, is only the proverbial tip of the iceberg, here the iceberg is the film's story. There are a lot of wonderful things to discover in this film and I don't want to tease or spoil things for the reader. I believe that in describing something complicated, less, truly is, more.Jim Carrey gives a credible performance in his lead acting role here in a drama film. His first was in \"The Truman Show\" (1998). Kate Winslet, is the acting highlight of the film, giving, yet another impressive and memorable acting performance in the lead actress role of the film, opposite Jim Carey.This is a film, in which many positive things can be said about, in a long review. Unfortunately, or fortunately, I lack the knowledge and talent for that. Films about memories are difficult to make in a convincing manner. \"Memento\" (2000), also a film about memory, works in a different and less impressive style than \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". The only recent excellent film about memory that comes to mind is \"Afterlife\" (Japan, 1998). The best stories are ones that are original, genuine, keenly perceptive and brutally honest. \"Eternal Sunshine\" is truly a thought provoking film about the usefulness and purpose of human memories, good and bad.Awards: Nominated for and won Academy Award for \"Best Original Screenplay\", Kate Winslet nominated (her fourth acting nomination) for Academy Award as Best Actress in a Leading Role. Kate Winslet is the youngest ever actress to achieve 4 Academy Award nominations for acting. She achieved her fourth here, at age 29, for this film.\n",

      "I think that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a great film if not a bit quirky. Jim Carrey as Joel and Kate Winslet as Clementine meet each other at a train station and ended up dating. But soon after, Clementine has here mind erased of Joel. Saddened, Joel decides to have the same procedure. But Joel finds that the mind eraser can be a bad thing, in his case. This film have strange aspects because there has never been a movie like this before. The acting is superb. Seeing Jim Carrey serious is something you won't see every day. All the actors had great chemistry together. The score was also \"new.\" There is a new hype added into the music. The only reason I gave this a 8/10 because the plot is confusing and it still confuses me after a couple times viewing. It goes to flashback, then current, then flashback, etc. It is interesting, though. I rate this film a 8/10.\n",
      "861\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine is one of the most intelligent, romantic comedy movies ever made. Any kind of praise will not be enough for this movie as for me everything related to this movie is just perfect, be it acting, directing, screenplay, music, dialog's, cinematography and everything else. Acting by Kate Winslet is one of the best and she is one of my fav actresses and this movie made me enjoy her acting even much more than ever. Jim Carrey too is perfect in his role, though I am not a big fan of his earlier movies but I was simply flattened by his acting in this one. Both the actors are at their witty best, sensible, and all. I love Charlie Kauffman's script and this one is just way ahead of all his other movies, he is one of the best script writers present in the industry. Direction by Gondry is top notch, the techniques he uses in the movie and the way movie is presented is just too good. Music too is very good and hits the right notes with the scenes all the time. Dialogues in the movie are witty, sensible, and intelligent. It will be a crime if I don't mention the supporting casts in the movie (Dunst, Ruffalo, Wilkinson, and Elijah) all are very good in their roles and done full justice in the movie. I love movie from the start to the end but I do have few of my favorite scenes and they are: 1. When Joel and Clementine meets for the first time at the beginning of the movie. The chemistry is just too good. 2. When Joel and Clementine goes to the ice lake in the night. 3. When Mary tells the quotations to Howard in Joel's home, the quotations, her recital of these, the background music and then the parade are all just awesome. And many many more scenes involving Joel and Clementine are too good. So if you haven't already then do watch this movie and before writing it off try to get into the movie mood and enjoy it. As many of my friends didn't get it for the first time and forgot to enjoy this masterpiece. Give it a fair chance.\"How Happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\"\n",

      "I took sometime to read the original screenplay by Charlie Kaufman few days ago. I reade the screenplay of Adaptation then saw the film and I was totally disappointed in the movie because the screenplay is much better. However this time I watched the movie first then reade the screenplay. I actually liked the movie better because the ending of the screenplay is totally different from the movie.I think one of the things that Charlie Kaufman wanted to portray in his screenplay was that he didn't want this movie to be like the rest of the Hollywood films and have a happy ending which is what every audience wants which is to see boy and girl get together in the end. In his original screenplay thats not what happened. Kauffman had Clementine as an old lady going to the Docotor who is married to his assistant to erase Joel for like the 50th time or something and there was no love between them in the end. I think Hollywood totally changed the ending to fit the audiences expectations.In Kauffman's original screenplay Joel also talked about how he is bored with naomi because he watched too many movies and maybe he expects to have an exciting relationship like those in the movies and that's the reason why he chose Clementine over Naomi. Yes, in the screenplay Naomi actually played a part in Joel's life. We see pasts from their relationship. I think that's why in the screenplay Kauffman didn't want to give that feeling there's hope between Joel and Clementine. He actually wanted to say that people don't really change. We just make the same mistakes over and over again if we are ignorant. But in the movie it tells us that there is hope between Joel and Clementine maybe they could be happy the second time around.I think I liked the movie version and it touched me more than the screenplay because it gave me hope in the end. But that's not what Kauffman wanted in his screenplay. So, are we all just a bunch of ignorant people that has been affected by Hollywood's movies because we expect our relationships to be the same as the movies like the original Joel in the screenplay? Is that why people that have boring relationships can't be satisfied because they want something more? I have to say I liked the movie better but the original screenplay was more of an masterpiece. It really made me think. Anyways I think you people that liked the movie should read the screenplay.\n",

      "Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has erased him from her memory due to a problematic relationship. He look out for the creator of that process, the doctor Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and decide to erase Clementine from his memory but what Joel doesn't know is that he still loves her.The script of the great film ,written by Charlie Kaufman & Michel Gondry, is nothing but a great, original and sometimes touching story about the eternal love of two persons. The non-linear way that the film is told is really great and will keep you in alert all the 108 minutes of the film. I love the story of Joel and Clementine, two persons that must be together and doesn't matter that creepy process because their love is so strong that nothing can erase it. That process is really amazing and very difficult to deal with and must be really convince about use it. I'm not sure if the process really works for two persons that once were in love, it's a fact that technically works but in the case of Mary (Kirsten Dunst) in the end the process don't work because she fell in love with Dr. Howard Mierzwiak again. So i think the process will erase your memories about the time that you spend with the person but you can't really forget that person because in both cases of the film the couples still feel something about each other. So i think you can't just forget a person, yes you can forget about the bad times with the person but if you feel in love with her/him again you will have the same experiences?Anyway i really love that things of the film and also some really great lines. The cast of the film is superb; Jim Carrey is amazing in his most recognized work. I was checking his filmography in this site and i must say that i really like most of his films and i consider myself a big fan of Carrey so i found this performance as just another great one from a great actor. Kate Winslet is amazing too, i think is the first time i see her after the extremely overrated \"Titanic\", so for me this is my favourite performance of her. The supporting cast is great, with Kirsten Dunst in a great and very touching role, Elijah Wood & Mark Ruffalo are great too but i really hate the role of Wood.When this film was released back in 2004, everybody seems to like it and i hear really good things about it from people who i know but i never feel lots of desires to watch it and later i just forget about the film. After almost four years of it's release (19 March 2004 according to this site) i finally watch this film near the Valentine's day for pure coincidence . For that i want to say that my favourite line of the film is the one in the first sequence when Joel express his feels about that day. I think is a great film to forget about that day and remember that love is not only for one day peer year. Conclusion: i really like this film, a very different one but i don't give it a 10 because i feel that in a way Michel Gondry was abusing of his particular style in this film. Anyway this film is a film to remember. 9 out of 10Region 4 DVD: this DVD is really complete with many extras like making of the film, an interview with Gondry and Carrey and some others like a commercial of Lacuna.\n",

      "this movie really makes you feel something if you've ever thought of love, being loved, and loving someone else. i loved the color and the music. i can't stand Jim carry, but i've got to admit that this movie made me see him in a different light. this movie and garden state are at the top of my list and i don't enjoy movies of today at all. everything becomes predictable and boring. however, eternal sunshine really made me think about taking things back and starting over. nothing we can do in reality, but it's the what if's that make life interesting and this movie definitely holds my attention.definitely not a movie for fans of pop culture and celebrity lifestyles. more for a thinking, creative type.\n",

      "First of all, reviews of the film are quite deceiving, and stand as blatant misrepresentations of its genre. On the cover of my copy it says \"A smart, sexy and seriously funny comedy!\" This is simply not true. To label Eternal Sunshine as a \"funny comedy\" is to completely misunderstand the underlying message of Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry's masterpiece. While certain aspects of the film are indeed funny, the genre of \"comedy\" is the furthest thing from an accurate label. Finding a place to begin describing my reaction to Eternal Sunshine is a very tough thing to do, but I'll try to provide the reader with an honest attempt at a coherent rant about my love for this film. The intent of this post is not to provide a frame by frame summary. Instead, I want to give you my reactions to it. A summary simply does not do it justice. Eternal Sunshine is thought provoking and expressive. It's something you have to experience for yourself: As the title of my post states, Michel Gondry, Charlie Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth have created the most original and scintillating film I have ever seen. Nothing in this film fails to deliver, especially in terms of creativity, plot association, narrative structure, acting, direction and writing. As he has proved previously, Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) possesses the ability to produce expressive and emotional screen writing. Joel and Clementine (Carrey, Winslet) are exceptionally real characters with real problems, and Kaufman brings these problems to light through his remarkably \"real\" script. The film touches your imaginative subconscious directly to the bone. The films' beauty is mystifying, and it generates a truly remarkable feeling of personal, creative sincerity. Michel Gondry has captured some of the most beautiful images I have ever seen on camera (the big bed on the snow covered beach is a great example). It is my feeling that Eternal Sunshine would not have had the same impression on me if Michel had not directed it. His creative instinct is the best the film industry has to offer (see The Science of Sleep), and no one other than Michel could have captured the story with such creativity- a creativity the project was intended to provide from as far back as the drawing board. His directional methods are practical yet unique. 90% of what you see in Eternal Sunshine is done in front of the camera. The characters move in and out of rooms to create a discontinuity that is very effective as it pertains to the plot (If you are reading this after viewing the film, you know what I'm referring to). The scene where Joel is hiding under his mothers table is done in front of the camera as well. No CGI and no green screen. The set is altered to give the illusion that Joel as an adult is proportionate to his height as a child.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give stellar performances. They both execute Kaufman's script exceptionally well. Tom Wilkinson and Mark Ruffalo never fail to deliver, and both give great supporting performances. However, Kirsten Dunst lacks talent in my opinion. Her scene with Wilkinson in Joels' apartment is a bit too much. Eternal Sunshine is more of an artistic representation of film than it is film in the traditional sense, and that is why I find it so beautiful. If you're an imaginative person, and love finding unique, creative expression through film, then you are certain to love this one. But, what makes it even more exceptional is the fact that it is NOT strictly an artistic representation. In a traditional sense, the narrative is deep. It twists and turns while constantly providing uncertainty to narrative tension.As I've said before, Eternal Sunshine taps into the imaginative and creative subconscious like nothing I've ever seen. Its portrayal of love and love lost is executed beautifully through Michel Gondry's direction and Charlie Kaufman's screen writing. The film is a vivid portrayal of human nature, and why we love who we love. The films' ability to weave artistic imagination with substantive narrative action is truly remarkable. As a true film lover, I stand firm in my opinion that Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind is the best film I have ever seen.\n",

      "From Director and co-writer Michel Gondry comes the innovative and completely original Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. This could easily be considered the best love story of modern time which stands up in the leagues of Love Affair, Ghost, and Sleepless in Seattle.The film tells the story of Joel and Clementine, two thirty-somethings who are brought together by fate and torn apart by indifference's. When Joel finds out that Clementine gets a procedure to erase Joel from his memory, Joel strikes back with similar consequences. While Joel is getting the procedure done, which erases from most recent memory and back, he realizes his love for Clementine is very much alive. He fights against the \"machine\" to remember as much about her as possible.Jim Carrey gives the best performance of his career. His Joel is very vulnerable and awkward. We have never seen Carrey play a character like this when so little of his normal film antics come out. The early release date ruined his chances for consideration and with previous snubs for The Truman Show and especially Man on the Moon, Carrey is due for some serious recognition.Kate Winslet, who is arguably one of the greatest actresses working today, plays Clementine so incredibly free-spirited and vivacious, she's nearly unrecognizable. As awkward as the character is, Clementine possesses a special sexiness and attractive quality that draws the viewer to her and Winslet is at the helm of this ship. Not only is she incredibly sympathetic, she is the heroin of the picture. We haven't seen a film where the natural charisma of humanity is engaged so much in a character's words, expressions and general aura. The love for the character is what the viewer takes home with them and we wonder about her as well as Joel.The rest of the supporting cast is exceptional in their own ways: Tom Wilkinson, arguably snubbed for the win for his portrayal in In the Bedroom, brings the role of the rather cold-hearted doctor to life. His Dr. Howard is rather two-dimensional but Wilkinson does an exceptional job of making him purely human. Elijah Wood as the incredibly annoying and obnoxious Patrick takes him to new realms of acting. Wood has a hard time breaking free of his two-dimensional personality and making characters authentic. This is Wood's best portrayal yet including his powerful portrayal in Radio Flyer.Kirsten Dunst has returned to form since her breakout performance in 1994's Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, but she gives an admiral effort here as the lovely assistant Mary. This isn't just great comedic turn for her but an tremendous dramatic one. Mark Ruffalo as the zany and intelligent Stan is juicy in dialogue but rather one note in emotions. Stan is very likable but just can't get off the ground in terms of development and range. A disappointing turn for Ruffalo especially since we've seen what he can do in his breakthrough performance in You Can Count on Me.In the end it's the screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth that are the stars of the film. Kaufman who has wrote some of the most innovative films of modern cinema peaks at this point in his career. Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind don't even measure to the life of this film. The intangible life of the film is shown through ideas, energy, and strong development of story and creature.Eternal Sunshine shines on so many levels that you can't even start to touch the highest points of the film. This is the greatest story of all time, and the belief of love and redemption is visually stunning.Grade: ****/****\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was by far, in my opinion, the best movie of 2004. It makes you feel grateful for who you have in your life. There were also so many different genres that it's impossible to place it in just one. Comedy, mystery, and drama, all wonderful elements of the movie. When you're finished watching this, the utmost joy, love, wonder, and thankfulness is completely drowned upon you. The story is absolutely magical and the acting was phenomenal! All of this deserved many Academey Awards! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are very gifted actors, and Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson all did incredible as well! Out of any movie I recommend this, because it makes you feel so many different emotions in only a short amount of time. Eternal Sunshine is a very poignant, dreamy, and mysterious movie of love and memories.\n",

      "Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman wrote the wonderfully surreal 'Being John Malkovich', and he's at it again in 'The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', a similarly bizarre tale. To classify (wholly unfairly) it as genre, it's a romantic sci-fi (and how many of those do you see?), set in a world where disillusioned lovers can have their memories of each other erased. There's plenty of natural material in this concept, but unfortunately, Kaufman and director Michel Gondry are arguably guilty of trying a little too hard: the middle section of the movie takes place inside the characters' brains, for no real purpose in terms of plot: the film fills this logical vacuum with some evocative cinematography, but its impact is lessened because the film-makers have first licensed themselves to show anything they want. What they do get right, in combination with the leads, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett, is to show real (positive and negative) chemistry between the protagonists; if anything, at times they appear almost too adorable, but at least there's a spark. And although daft, the film is wholly watchable and actually not bad at manipulating the viewer's emotions; but perhaps Kaufman didn't need to make his script jump through quite so many hoops.\n",

      "Wow, what a film. Combining the narrative complexity of a Nolan film, the visual inventiveness of a Burton film, and the pure heart of a Spielberg film, it manages to reconcile all three concepts and become a truly magical film. As with most great films, I didn't fully appreciate it the first time I watched it, but a second viewing simply blew me away and now it's one of my favourite films. You could watch this film a hundred times and still find things to admire about it. The script is one of the most original and probably one of the best of all-time. Kate Winslet is terrific, but it's Carrey's reserved and nuanced performance that drives the film. The supporting cast are all very much supporting, but they're still great characters brought to life with equally great performances. Visually, the film is astonishing not for an overabundance of money shots, but for the subtlety and uniqueness of the effects present within it. And the love story feels true and genuine while still remaining romantic. All in all, one of the most innovative and wondrous films of our time.\n",

      "Wow! What a piece of art. It is so captivating and unique in a way that I can't even begin to explain, but will try for the well being of whoever may read this. First off I love Jim Carrey in this role. I find his serious roles to be some of his best. You compare this film to his comedies (like Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar, Me Myself and Irene) and you realize the maturity in his acting as compared to his usual genre. Other than Jim Carrey we have a great cast comprising of Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson. I might go as far as to say that this is the best Jim Carrey film I have ever seen. Not to say I don't like his comedies, but his acting is very refined and proves he is not bound by one genre of film.\n",

      "Too often relationships end poorly, and all the good times are forever tainted by the feelings of bitterness that come with a break up. As time goes by, people commonly become less forgiving of another's flaws, less charmed by their quirks, and less attracted to them physically. But even if something is dragged out until not a single spark flies, most of the time, it's all worth it. This movie is about remembering what is so wonderful about being in love, sometimes against all logic, sometimes against better judgment.. and that despite all the pain that comes with losing someone you care deeply for, in the end whatever time you did have together was better than never having experienced those feelings in the first place. Anyone suffering a great loss can feel tempted by the idea of removing all thoughts of the person from their memory, as a way to move on and get a fresh start. But if such a thing were actually possible, there would be a huge number of people regretting their decision to do so. To love deeply is to take a huge risk, but most people would agree that it is certainly worth it.\n",

      "Clever. Humorous. Keeps me company at night. I think I've watched this film 50 times. Maybe even more and I absolutely love it, absolutely think it's one of the best ever made. It is both complex and simple and who knew Jim Carey could actually act. Perhaps that isn't fair but the best work prior to this in my opinion is what he did on In Living Color. Maniac and unconcerned with Hollywood. Here, in Eternal, he is controlled and lovable. There I said it, Jim Carey is lovable. I also think that Kate Winslet is charming. Is she the only actress in Hollywood not afraid of showing here warts? Not that she actually has warts but she's not afraid to have ratty hair, I mean check out her excellent performance in Little Children. What other Hollywood A-list actress would ever intentionally come across as plain -- which she most certainly is not.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is one of my favourite movies of all time.It's an unique story about a man named Joel(Carrey) who gets shocked when he finds out that his girlfriend Clementine (Winslet) have erased all her memories of him and their unhappy relationship. He search for the company who have invented this machine who erases memories and ask them erase his memories of Clementine. But at the same time they erase it he discover many happy memories of the passion they had. Suddenly he don't want to forget her. So he take her into another parts of his brain.Where they don't belong. This makes of course serious consequences...This is a beautiful story written by Charlie Kaufman, who has also written Being John Malkovich and Adaptation.√çt's a great story because it has a deep and serious side of love. Sometimes we want every arguing and fighting we have in our relationships erased from our lives and we just want to remember the passion and the good feelings we had in every broken relationships. Sometimes not also of course.Jim Carrey plays this man Joel very good. I first thought it was just another funny performance he usually plays, but this time he plays a serious role and he does it very good. He was perfect for the role. Because he can express sorrow and anger in way I could not imagine he ever done in a movie I seen.Kate Winslet is great and awesome in this role as Clementine and I don't understand why she did not won the academy award. Hilary Swank's performance as Maggie Fitzergald in Million dollar baby was not bad, but I think Kate Winslet was much better and much more unforgettable. It was like I knew her somehow.Man! I wish I had a girlfriend like her. She was very cool in her colourful clothes and her beautiful hair.So therefor I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something new and different they have not seen in a while.If You don't understand the story at the first time you see it see it one more time. Then You probably understand.Anyhow, have a good time when you see it and remember...Love conqueres everything <3\n",

      "The dynamic duo Kaufman/Gondry (writer/director in respective rolls), filled with inventive ideas as always, tackle a delicate texture of our romantic lives. This time around, they go after those fragile moments of love and tenderness we each seek after for years of our existence ¬ñ and ask what happens when those seem to end or simply slip away. Mixing humor, science fiction and a heart breaking soundtrack (try and listen to Beck's version of \"I Need Your Loving\" and tell me you didn't cry), Gondry managed to tame the ever so wild Jim Carey, who in return delivered one of his best performances to date ¬ñ tied up there with his portrayal of Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon. In case that's one too many Kaufman's for you folks at home, Eternal Sunshine also offers stunning performances by a vary of esteemed actors and actresses, including Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom), Mark Rufallo (Collateral) ¬ñ and the ever so adoring and lovely Kate Winslet (Titanic, Finding Neverland).

The acting is astounding and the characters, however realistic and easy, are complex. The relation of characters, and the relation of effect with acting, is not seen in many other films. I can watch this movie at any time, even if the movie can become dreary and muddled, you can always pick out the emotion.

I couldn't ever expected Jim to perform as well as he did and would have never imagine Kate to do anything better than Titanic (which I didn't enjoy). If you liked Winslet because of Titanic forget this one.The movie may confuse you quite a bit and maybe you need to be somewhat acquainted with a similar situation for you to fully feel what the movie intends to express.

      "I, personally, hate romantic comedies because I find that most of them are so frivolous that they don't warrant my attention. This movie, on the other hand, moved me incredibly. It is to date to be the only romantic movie that I can stand. It is a beautiful statement that no matter what, true love endures. Complete with memorable performances from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and an incredible supporting cast, this movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen.I can see how some people think it's stupid however. The movie did not follow a normal linear time progression (it essentially starts and the end and goes backwards) and I could see how some people would find that confusing. I will admit, the first time I watched this movie I had no idea what was going on until the end. Then, with a full understanding of what was going on, I watched the movie a second time. That was when I fell in love with it. This is an amazing movie and definitely worth your time to see. It's a shame that it lost Best Picture of the Year to Million Dollar Baby.\n",

      "In a Hollywood climate where romantic films take on the same motif as the predecessors that went before, a breath of fresh air is an understatement to what this film is. This is more than a film. It takes a look at how relationships nowadays pan out. It is so honest and so movingly real that you begin to forget its a film, and think back to all the past relationships you had where you said what Joel or Clementine said, or the situations they get in as a couple.There is such a moving storyline. Joel (Jim Carey, who i believe should be best remembered for this) is such an affecting character by being so modest and genuine. When Clementine first takes him back to her place, the way in which he says he has nothing to say, and that he is not that interesting - the self deprecation is not only touching, but also vitally poignant, as it highlights how many men i know feel about talking to women. The intimidation and crippling shyness is a huge obstacle, and only in this film have i ever seen it portrayed with any real conviction.Im not going to tell you how the film runs, scene by scene, or give you the plot outline, as this would be a dis-justice to a film that needs to be watched and appreciated, and moreover deserves to be.I doubt any film will ever speak to you about relationships like this one does. It tells it how it is, relationships in our generation - the fear of being alone, love, wanting to forget the bad partners. But it is all done with such tact and elegance, that you rarely feel bad for the state of affairs.I cant recommend this movie highly enough.10/10\n",

      "This is a film watched best with no preconceptions about it, like me at the time. All I knew was that it starred Jim Carrey (a fact that nearly prevented me watching it) and that it had received generally good reviews.The story was hard to follow at first but once it started to fall into place and I understood what was going on I became hopelessly overcome by emotion. I've never seen such an original and heartbreaking film about love. It made me think about real relationships - how all those happy memories can begin to disintegrate when they are tainted by the bitterness and regret that can creep up on you when a relationship falls apart. I looked at my own (very happy) marriage and hoped to God that I will never forget all the wonderful times we've shared, even if we don't last the distance. I had sobbed my heart out by the end of the film but I honestly felt all the better for it.Jim Carrey is a marvel to watch. It's as if his usual screen persona was switched with the character played by Kate Winslet. I had no clue that he could deliver such a subtle, sympathetic performance. Kate Winslet's Clementine could have been the typical annoyingly ditsy flake seen so often in films about love and relationships but she was truly believable and utterly unique.This film requires several viewings to completely appreciate the dialogue, the special effects (although I believe some were camera tricks rather than computer-generated) and the meticulous attention to detail. A highly recommended masterpiece.\n",

      "The score of this film is simply phenomenal. I cannot express enough the importance of a quality score in a film. In this particular film, which is one of my personal favorites of all time, the score had great songs composed by Jon Brion. He used a relatively unusual form of synthesized music with dark undertones and light overtones to portray the negativity of the basic principles of memory- erasing, and the temporary positivity of forgetting the dark past. The camera angles, the lighting/ settings, and the dialog are all very strong in this film, but what separates this film from others with the same qualities I mentioned previously is that the score bridges the gap between those very qualities and the viewer. Depending on one's appreciation, taste, and knowledge of music the score of any film can make or break it- in this case my obvious opinion is that it makes the film that much better.\n",

      "After watching the show for like 10minutes ago, Jesus Christ , (I know this may sound lame or gay) but I think it kinda have a effect on me...I don't know what it is, but it seem like I'm kinda a change person, for example somehow now , i rather appreciate the things around me more than before , I never do things that I will do to regret, I even think twice now before doing something...It just kinda flows with it you know. I've learned so much from this film, I mean really, a lot. The moral values it has, the meaning of love , what's life about or perhaps to value the things that we have before its too late...that's why I'm so proud & glad that i've watched this show, otherwise I'm really a dumbass to miss what you called a 'movie'.All I can say is that this show is worth every penny in the world to be watch. The acting is just so A+++ rating , the plot , script , actors , everything just fit so perfectly. Some twist & turns , u might need to think a little bit to understand exactly what's this show is telling or if you're too lazy to think , u might wanna watch it another time, and I tell you, YOU WILL NOT GET BORED TO WATCH THE SECOND TIME, in fact it might seem better than the first time u've watched. Anyhow, that's all write about , so if anyone who knows this show and haven't watch it, SHOULD WATCH !!!!! Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind IS WHAT YOU CAN REALLY CALL A MOVIE !\n",

      "I just loved this movie! You would think that Jim Carrey is only good for Comedy laughters like Bruce Almighty or Cable Guy but once you've seen this movie you'd be shocked as how good he actually is! The combination of Kate Winslet and Jim Carey is amazing in this movie and also how everything comes together at the end! This movie should be watched without going to the bathroom just sitting there and enjoying every moment of it! I Would say the best way to summarize this movie is \"Great\" it surely deserves a better spot on the rank and surely can be added to ANY DVD collectors collection. I recommend this movie to everybody!\n",

      "Normally I'm a Carrey-phobic, taking excruciating measures to ensure that I don't see his films, knowing that no matter what hell I go through to avoid them, actually seeing them would be so much worse. Having said that, I was still convinced to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, expecting Jim to ruin a good premise as usual.But Jim must've been feeling ill, there were no stupid facial expressions and no lewd spasms to be seen. Instead he turned in the performance of his life, making this not only the most watchable Jim Carrey movie yet, but a great movie in its own right. I don't know what the director said to him, but I hope he remembers it for his next movie. Amazingly his co-star, Kate Winslet, who I never enjoyed much either, followed suit and played her role equally well.Sadly the movie is probably too confused and surreal to fetch much mainstream attention, but then the public at large never knows a good movie when they see one. Or more likely, don't see one. However, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is probably the best movie since Lost in Translation and like Lost in Translation it will likely be far too overlooked. Do yourself a favor and give this movie the chance it deserves, you might be surprised.\n",

This is probably the best movie I have ever seen. The creativity of the team behind this movie has to be admired. If I was one of the people that choose who win Acadamy Awards, this movie would be \"Best Picture\" Oh, wait. That's impossible, I forgot, only mainstream movies get Oscars. Anyway, this movie chronicles the love life of Joel Barrish and Clementine Kruczynski. When Clementine and Joel get into a big fight, Clementine gets her memory of him erased (which doesn't spoil much) I'm not going to spoil the rest of the movie, you'll just have to watch it. This Is such an amazing film, Its odd, funny, sad at times, romantic, and the first time Jim Carrey has played a serious role. Too bad it bombed at theaters, while people waited in line to see the new \"Denzel Washington\" action movie. Go buy the DVD now, it is an AMAZING movie.Rating: 20 out of 10\n",

      "Every time I watch this movie I find something new. It feels almost like d√©j√† vu . I already know how the story unfolds, yet I am still eager to watch it develop in front of me all over again. Watching through 'clear eyes' I discover fresh concepts, film techniques, and story connections to my own reality.It flows through my eyes, to my body, to my heart, and until it finally reaches my soul. I fell in love once. A love just like Clementine and Joel. Complicated. Painful. A mixture of love and hate. Every time I watch the movie, I think of him. I often wonder how would I feel if I had erased him, erase everything, just like Joel and Clementime. We found a house on the beach, just like Joel and Clementine, and I remember thinking back to it. Our house as broken down, either because the building of it had never been completed or it broke down through the years. It was surrounded by pieces of broken shells and glass, containing only walls and stairs that led to the heavens. It stands alone, illuminated only by the fading light of the sunset. I think of that every time I watch this movie, often identifying with Clementing and seeing my former lover as Joel. As Clementine, I understand her intricacy, impulsiveness, and frustrations. For Joel, I see in him the reservation, hesitancy, and fears I saw in that person I once saw as the anchor that steadied my shaky ship.The method with which the film is presented complex and dream-like, yet it is also the most accurate depiction of the human experience. We often live in the in-between moments of the past and present, filled with regrets, hopes, fears, and a simple desire to experience the beauty and pain of love. Everyone has had moments wherein the pain has felt so tremendous that all you wanted was for those memories to disappear and begin again with a 'spotless mind.' Oftentimes, the loss of someone significant in our lives propels our minds to automatically create a slide-show of memories and images of both the good times and the bad. Simultaneously wanting to forget, yet never wanting to let go. This is the beauty and brilliance of this film, it has found a way into our collective memories and translated the images of our mind unto the screen.\n",

      "Absolutely reflective. If you do not understand, do not get it, or can't relate... then I am sorry to say that on an emotional level, you are a cripple. You've missed out on a lot, on life. On some level and in some time, everyone has experienced Joel's pain. If you say you haven't, then you either are the above said cripple or you've let yourself forget... without the memory-cell killing. We all learn to cope somehow, it's a part of growing up a part of becoming a mature adult. Our memories are all we truly have, they are what make us who we are and by definition define us - through our actions and reactions based on past experiences. The writing is second-to-none and Jim Carrey proves his worthiness as a lead actor in a dramatic role. Best Film Ever. Absolutely Brilliant.\"Continue to defend the illusory self and you will become ignorant of the true self...you will suffer and suffer again.\"\n",

      "This movie had to have been Jim Carrey's Greatest performance. You don't usually see the \"drama\" side of him and that is what made this movie a great one. When I saw it the first time, I was a little confused on what is happening in the movie. I had to watch it a second time to understand it completely and fully. I think that if Jim Carrey did more movies like this it would show that he more than just that side of a hilarious comedian. For example, the movie \"Liar Liar\" was an excellent movie and was downgraded probably because of a lack of drama and other themes. But it is difficult to get high ratings on a comedy movie. I also believe that if he did another film with Kate Winslet sort of like this one then he would attract more people to watch his movies because most people never see Jim as a drama actor, they see him as a comedian. If somehow there was an \"eternal sunshine of the spotless mind 2\" then I hope to be first in line to see it because it would make an excellent sequel to the first one. I hope Jim plays in more drama movies like these.\n",

      "Perhaps, one of the most intriguing, weird, surreal, once in a lifetime movies. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is not just a wonderful, well put together love story, but it keeps you thinking throughout the movie. Believe it or not, it took me two times to understand it. The surrealism and symbolism is so well put together that it sucks you in. Maybe not for other people, but I truly identify with Jim Carrey's character. Ever since I've watched it, I've been seeing life, love and happiness in a much different way. This movie, no, this piece of art has my highest recommendation for people into drama, love and a very interesting story line movies.9/10 ~James R.\n",

      "I recently saw this movie for the second time, and I liked even better than I did the first time. This quirky film takes a very unusual route to universal truths about love, relationships and how deeply memories are a part of us. It's funny, true, bizarre and charming at once...and may get you thinking of your own failed and successful relationships from the first new exciting moments to the comforts of just being with the one your in love with to the point where you drive each other crazy, no matter how much you love them. Well paced and the stellar cast all with excellent performances, and an unlikely but surprisingly good pairing of Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey(who certainly takes a departure from his big budget roles here.) I highly recommend this movie...what a pleasant surprise it is.\n",

      "First off, this movie is odd, as we are watching Joel (Jim Carrey) get his ex-girlfriend, Clemintine (Kate Winslet) erased from his mind. Basically, it's a collection of their experiences together, and we're watching it slowly crumble.This film is a masterpiece. It's amazing and fast-paced, with unforgettable scenes, such as a scene with a Young Joel and an Older Clemintine, placed as his mother's friend.The acting in this movie is fantastic. It shows that Jim Carrey can be a great actor, despite his comedian status. Kate Winslet brings Clementine to life as a flamboyant, erratic, and sometimes annoying women, who is honest and tells you what you don't want to hear. It is an amazing film for both actors.In the end, it all wraps into a warped romance, about destiny and the inevitability of someone coming into your life. It's wonderful and smart, and not for the average movie goer. Possibly the best film I've seen in two years. I highly recommend it.\n",

      "In a dazed morning, Joel is heading to work, yet takes an impulsive move and ditches; heading to Mantauk. On his day visit he meets Clementine. She energetic and speaks before thinking, the complete contrast of Joel who is very closed and reserved; yet they connect just as the saying goes. It's three days before valentines and Joel has hit a wall; Clementine doesn't know Joel anymore. Clementine has erased Joel from her memory, which in effect makes Joel do the same. Lacuna Inc has devised an operation that will destroy memories for people wanting to leave a bad memory behind. While Joel is asleep, we wander through Joel's memories of their relationship; starting at the latest times of their relationship falling apart to the beginning where the connection first happened. When Joel starts seeing the good times with Clementine, he doesn't want to lose them, with him and Clementine racing through memories and his mind to stop them before he loses her completely and forgotten her.After the success of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, Charlie Kaufman has become synonymous with eccentric stories. While Confessions of a dangerous mind was more straight forward, Eternal Sunishine returns him to the non conventional world; the extreme left field. The concept of erasing memories is wonderfully explored by Kaufman and Gondry. While everyone has memories they want to forget, its those that define us. Lose is a powerful emotion that we don't understand till we have lost, as it is that reality check of life. Though Joel had fixated on the worst times, it wasn't till he remember what made their relationship so great that he realised what he was losing, trying to desperately in vain to salvage what he could.Michel Gondry's direction compliments Kaufman's story. Gondry having started in music videos has incorporated that creative style, making a very off centered world; for an off centered story. The memories of Joel are creatively envisioned, where they start to merge on each other. There is so much detail to ESOTSM, even after several views there are minute details to pick and find. How objects start to disappear or blur are so perfectly done, at times you don't realise things are disappearing. A great scene is when Joel and Clementine are talking in a bookstore and all the books start turning white and blank; it really hits the situation of the story and brings out the symbolism that Kaufman has embedded.Jim Carey while being a comedy master gives his best performance. It such a huge leap from Carey to act such a depressed and introverted character, yet he shines for it. He has shown he has a broader scope of ability from his comic eccentricities. Kate Winslet perfectly matches Clementine, adding so much energy and contrasting Joel's rigidness. While Kate makes Clementine so energetic, she creates this mysterious aurora that there is more too her, she is really insecure but she hides her emotions behind a facade of impulses. Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as the technicians performing the procedure, both play it minimalistic. They don't show much emotions, yet your still able to understand what their thinking. Kirsten Dunst gives one of her better performances as the receptionist of Lacuna Inc, same to Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, head of Lacuna Inc.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is such a spectacular love story, as it never falls into the clich√©d formula. There is so much heart in Kaufman's non linear story. It's a mind bending story, yet one of the most original and heart warming movies you'll see. You seriously want to hug someone after watching this.\n",

      "ETERNAL SUNSHINES OF THE SPOTLESS MIND was an imaginative and entertaining 2004 comedy about a milquetoast (Jim Carrey) who accidentally learns that his ex-girlfriend (Kate Winslet) went to a mysterious company and had their relationship completely erased from her memory and he is so resentful of this, that he decides to do the same. During this process we are treated to various flashbacks and flashforwards which come at a lightning pace documenting this wild and twisted relationship. The real star of this film is its Oscar winning screenplay...an intelligent and totally original screenplay that demands attention be paid to dialogue and detail. Jim Carrey delivers his best performance since THE TRUMAN SHOW and Kate Winslet received an Oscar nomination for her luminous performance as his independent-minded girlfriend. A truly unique film experience for those who are game.\n",

Kaufmann is probably one of the best writers in the business, \"Being John Malkovich\", \"Adaptation\" - both brilliant, and now this! Can't wait for his next movie. If you haven't already seen it (twice), do it now!The way he writes these twisted stories about the human mind, dreams, fantasies and imagination is remarkable... without ever being artsy and nauseating. Even if you don't like films in this genre, the music alone should make you want to see this film.More Carrey, more Gondry, more Kaufmann please!

      "I am not into sci-fi movies at all, and frankly speaking movies like matrix(the 2nd and 3rd part) which show preposterous concepts pi** me off.But I couldn't help admiring this movie.First of all, the very idea of this movie is so great complemented by an equally great direction. Its about 2 lovers who decide to erase each other from their memories since things don't go well between them, but something goes amiss and by the end of the movie you realize what our memories are worth.Those of you who have suddenly realized at the end of a dream, that it cant be real,its a dream and wake up, would find something similar going on here when Joel while trying to erase Clementine from his memory , decides otherwise.The director has shown it in a beautiful way and if not anything else you've got to see the movie for this.Most of the stuff you see in movies have been shown in some way or the other in different movies,but this thing that I am talking about is just marvelous and you gotta watch the movie for it or you'll miss out on some really good and original creations of Hollywood.There are many other things i want to write but if i divulge too much my name will be blacklisted.Its a creative movie and if you are in the mood for something that deserves a piece of your mind,time and money go for it.\n",

      "all of the above and more.Absolutely stunning performances from the lead cast, especially Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett. The others did great jobs too.The way this movie is shot is like a huge breath of fresh air. Michel Gondry has such a wonderful vision and talent for translating ideas into beautifully shot scenes. I really admire the way that he manages to do so many crazy and inventive things without resorting to CGI like so many other films have done. Everything is right there in front of you, shot with real people and objects, and it really pays off.As for the story, absolutely gripping from start to finish and completely coherent all the way through. This surprised me (especially the last part) as the time line does jump around a fair bit.The greatest thing about this movie though, is the way it makes you laugh through to cry and feel just about everything in between. I think that almost everyone (unless very young) will connect and relate to this film, even if they haven't experienced the central theme for themselves. Those who haven't may even find it more of an exciting journey than those who have,.Also the final scene absolutely took my breath away.The best love story I have seen in a long long time, and one that has much broader appeal than any I have ever seen.\n",

      "'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a brilliant and highly original film, often provoking a lot of thought and revealing its plot gradually. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2004.It's hard to really summarize the plot without spoiling it because the film releases it gradually, but this is the best I can do without spoiling it. The film is about a couple who had been in a relationship and who had undergone psychological treatments to rid them of the painful memories so that they can start their separate life again. Little did they know that they are being brought back together by fate, and they soon realize what they had. The film also features a couple minor subplots, but you'll have to watch the film to see what they are.I don't know how I'd classify this film. It's not quite a romance, and it's not quite science-fiction. But, it is probably the type of film any of us who have been in a painful relationship can relate to.Artistic and well done in nearly every aspect, this film deserved more recognition than it received. (I only fault it slightly in that I was able to predict the plot quite early on - although others I saw the film with did not, and that it did go a little overboard with the ending and seemed to lose direction when the whole story before that was done beautifully.) However, I think it is an excellent film, despite the few (very few) faults. I highly recommend this film.\n",

      "What makes a film great? This is an issue that is totally open to question. Maybe that is because there are people who do not like this film, although it is really not easy for me to understand at first. On the other hand, I believe that as an art product(we can certainly name such a movie as art, can't we?)this film forms very strong emotional links through the hearts of the audience and that is why it is qualified as \"best\" by lots of people. It tries and achieves lots of new and surprising things that we are not accustomed to see in cinema: a totally crazy story from a very well-known subject, that is well-known since the birth of humanity, a marvelous way of explaining such a crazy story visually and the actors and actresses who are as natural as real people who has lived the pain of love...That is why this is best among a category that it has created with itself; because if this is a just a film, than I can say that I have never watched a film.This is an art product; that has some cinema, some poetry and some paint in it.Some people criticize this film, for using an easy subject, that may affect everybody who has fallen in love, without any effort.If this film can affect me me, as a person who has never fallen in love(sad, but true)this much, I am sure it is not really easy.\n",

      "\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resigned.\" - Alexander Pope.Charlie Kaufmans 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a fresh, original, intelligent circular film. This quote not only provides the moral to \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" but also what the film investigates. It questions whether forgetting certain past experiences provides eternal sunshine for a spotless mind. It explores the concept of memory erasure, its consequences and raises the question; if you had the option to erase a memory would you? This film has explored and portrayed the concept very well and it's definitely worth seeing.The narration is authentic with the aid of several talented actors including Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst. The special effects are clever as memories deconstruct while the two characters run through and re-enact these memories.Joel (Carrey) is socially inefficient, quiet and self-contained 3-dimensionally viewed character (we view him in his conscious, unconscious and subconscious states). He meets his precise opposite, Clementine (Winslet) a wild, adventurous, flamboyant, multi-layered and multi-faceted woman on a chance meeting and they immediately connect as 'opposites attract'. However the relationship ends through constant arguments and Joel soon comes to discover that Clementine has subsequently had her memory erased of him by a company called Lacuna. In retaliation and pure heartbreak Joel books himself in for the procedure.The erasing process involves mind-mapping his brain and then an 'all night' process of erasing each memory from the most recent to the primary meeting. Although mind erasure is impossible and somewhat unbelievable, Kaufman is able to compel you to accept such a procedure to be true as it is explained in detail.The technicians Stan (Ruffalo) and Patrick (Wood) who carry out the erasure, along with Secretary Mary (Dunst) provide an element of humour as they drunkenly jump on his bed in their underwear oblivious to the unconscious patient. Most of the film takes place in Joel's mind as we meander in and out of his memories and sub consciousness during the erasing of the memories he has of Clementine. During some of the memories he is re-en acting, he is able to compose various incidents that never existed due to being in his sub-conscious state. The most recent memories are bitter from arguments and of a run-down relationship. But as we move further into the past, and reminisce on his and Clementine's best moments, Joel is reminded of why he loved and still loves Clementine. With this recollection, Joel wishes to stop the procedure but in his unconscious state the drunkards dancing on his bed are oblivious. We then watch him and his mental materializations of Clementine flee from erasing memories. He attempts to store her in the depths of his other memories which are not on the mind map. The story unravels with unexpected twists and a questionable ending as to whether it is a sad or joyful closure. Perhaps that is up to you.The conclusion of the film is more of an enigma and it is one of several; would we have our memory erased and what would the consequences be? Also would we be prepared to erase the bad memories as well as the good? This is Jim Carrey's best performance. My opinion fluctuated from a previous negative perception of his typical comedic roles. He played Joel with poignancy and honesty. He captures the essence of the character with utter brilliance. I truly felt for Joel and related to his character as we all know someone like him.Also Kate Winslet's (out of the ordinary) role as fiery Clementine is one to admire with the best portrayal of 'waking up' I have ever seen. This was one of Winslet's best roles. She and Carrey made the unlikely couple seem perfect for each other.I adore Gondry's music and in various moments such as when Joel is crying whilst driving, the music is most apt. It enhances the bizarre feel to the film as well as the emotional aspect.Although the film could be situated in the science-fiction genre, the essence of the film is the emotions and relationships between characters. Its lack of success at the box office in the U.S and U.K in 2003 is misleading as this is an original film with depth and intelligence because it gives the aspect that memories can be bought and sold in a commercial way, but experiences are what shape our character and to erase them would be to deny our past. It may be an indication that what is most popular at the box office is not always the best film available.\n",

      "First of all, this is NOT a Mask or Ace Ventura. I believe that most people saw Jim Carreys name on the cast and thought this would be a wonderful little In Living Colour skit. This is the first time I can actually say I Like Jim Carrey, I like him A lot. His acting in this movie, alongside Kate Winslet, was superb. I remember when I saw this in the theater, I was fighting with my girlfriend. I ran out of the theater and called her. That is the impact this movie can have. I do, however, recommend watching this at least twice before making a judgment on it. The first time you can be very confused, and almost lost at certain parts. The reward is finally understanding the plot. Some wonderful music really sets the mood as well. Beck has a very important role in this movie, when Joel is breaking down as the rain pours down. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a chance, or for some a second chance.\n",

Coupled with the talents of director Gondry, the quality of this film shines through in every scene.The story is told through a dream-like yet vivid serious of recollections and events that paint a bright and multi-colored picture of the characters. Gondry is able to paint such a vivid picture that the characters feel so organic that their personalities can be felt by the audience.All in all seeing this film is a bittersweet irony and is definitely worth seeing.\n",

      "The first time I saw it I was pretty confused, but seeing it again I can almost understand the plot. Basically Joel Barish (another more serious role for BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey) wakes up with no memory of the night before, and his car scratched. He skips work and heads to the shore, and as he travels he keeps seeing Clementine (no jokes, e.g. Huckleberry Hound's \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\") Kruczynski (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet). First she is asking if they know each other, then they lie together on the thick ice of a lake, and then all of the sudden it cuts to Joel upset because of their split. He finds out that she went to Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and had all memories of Joel erased from her memory, so he follows her. As his memories are erased, his mind rediscovers past passions, and he almost tries to escape the procedure. Meanwhile, out of Joel's mind, Stan (Mark Ruffalo) is carrying out the erasure, while his partner Patrick (Elijah Wood, after the last Lord of the Rings) is trying to create a relationship with the now Joel-memory erased Clementine using Joel's stuff. Stan is also trying to continue his relationship with co-worker Mary (Kirsten Dunst), but she finds out that she had memories of a passion with Dr. Howard erased. When the erasure is complete, you find out the segments at the beginning was after the procedure, so Joel and Clementine pretty much start their passion all over again, even after Mary gives them back their opinion chats of each other back. Also starring Jane Adams as Carrie and Scary Movie 2's David Cross as Rob. It might be complicated inside Carrey's mind, but it is a very inventive story about how memories can construct our minds. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film and the David Lean Award for Direction for music video director Michel Gondry, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay. Very good!\n",

      "The title comes from the poem \"Eloisa to Abelard\" by Alexander Pope. It is so nice to know our screenwriters are literate in our pop culture that rarely 'quotes' anymore. Charlie Kaufman penned this one as well as \"Being John Malkovich\" so he is very much into getting into our heads. If you could wipe the memories of a love affair gone sour, would you? Time has a way of helping us with painful memories, so that eventually only the good memories remain, should we accelerate the process? Relationships, the fabric of humanity, is what we are all about, finding them, enjoying them, hating them, leaving them. Every couple in divorce court filled with disappointment and anger once sat looking into each others eyes, feeling madly in love. The film is a little choppy at times, but you can navigate the course. The point is that every couple has strengths, weaknesses and it can be easy to forget the good bits in a bad moment. So what would be the consequences if your partner had the memories of you erased after your relationship hit a bump in the road? It's a thoughtful story, and will add a bit to your intellectual repertoire if you have ventured away from your romantic poets.\n",

      "Tonight I was in the mood for a comedy. I thought I could use a laugh or three after the weekend that I have endured. So I decided on a Jim Carrey flick. Carrey never fails to bring joy so I loaded up Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Don't worry if you haven't seen it, no spoilers here.The first few minutes of the film roll along with perhaps a slight chuckle here and there, not really though. I'm thinking \"Great, artsy fartsy.\" Which normally would be fine, but not tonight, tonight I need a laugh. I was wrong. I needed this. Don't get me wrong, there are some very funny parts. But not haha funny. Dark funny. Funny that makes you realize that you are not the only one who does that, or thinks that way. Funny that when you laugh at it, you feel slightly uncomfortable, but you laugh anyway. Watch it alone the first time.You will figure out the ending about in the middle, but I think they want you to. It's not about what you know. It's about how it makes you feel. I guess everyone has felt what these characters feel. But everyone, you and the characters as well, have felt them differently. Just about every thing they take away from the characters has been taken away from me in some way, and probably you as well . What they give the characters back, that is what I needed. Even if it is only fantasy, it is still something that I never thought of. Perhaps the next time I find myself in one of those, \"I could die happy now\" situations, I will try to hold on to it. I won't take it for granted and....forget.Remember. That is the moral to this story. Remember.I highly recommend this film.Jerry\n",

      "Since the masses usually go to great lengths to over-analyze such manufactured, Hollywood-ized quirkiness as found in \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" I will spare everyone my long dissertation on the film (since I don't have one), and just say that, behind its clever casting (Jim Carrey, like Nicolas Cage in \"Adaptation,\" is playing a facsimile of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman), deliberately disjointed structure (it is a film about memory loss, after all), and emotional moments, the film is largely an exercise in overly self-conscious artistry. Light, diverting entertainment at best--nothing earth-shattering.\n",

      "This is by far, the greatest movie of all time. The reason I am saying this is because there isn't really another movie like it, it kinda has its own genre. It is also very moving and has been known to change peoples lives from all over the world, including me. In order to really adore and understand this movie, you will have to watch it twice. The acting is also very great and the film has a great cast. All of the characters are interesting and you really look at them as their character, not who they are in real life. The film is sure to make laugh, cry, and think. Even though this movie is getting great reviews and loved by many people over the world, it still is very underrated. Eternal Sunshine is a one-of-a-kind film that it sure to effect your brain and your heart at the same time.\n",

      "This will just be short and sweet. This film did sound interesting to me when I first heard about it. Since, the previews from certain people about this film sounded good. So, when at a game store I saw this film and decided to buy it. I have to tell you I was expecting it to be very dramatic before I started watching it. And it was, alittle strange too. In my opinion, a film with a genre of Drama/Romance/Sci-Fi all combined does not mix well. I may be wrong but I think it does. This film probably have been better if its storyline was better. I had a lot of trouble following it. If it had been better to follow it I might have enjoyed it. I guess there was too much drama in the film. I don't know. I will have to give a \"3\".\n",

      "This movie is splendid.I could relate to both main characters and many of the situations presented.It is like a puzzle piece that is not quite solved until the end,although you are given more than enough pieces to work with.There is humor,sadness,bizarre situations,and even a sci-fi feel to it that I did not expect.I recommend this movie to anyone who has had a passionate relationship and has a dash of abnormality to their character. Lovely.Jim Carrey is brilliant and not an ounce of his usual comedic behavior comes into this role.Kate Winslet is beautiful,she brilliantly captures the fierceness and free spiritedness of Clementine's sporadically inclined behavior.Mark Ruffalo has a very sultry demeanor that comes through in this role and also a very funny playful side.Kirsten Dunst exhibits wonderfully the qualities of a young girl in love with someone quite out of reach.Elijah Wood perfectly captures the needy boyfriend and the guy who has trouble with girls.All of the actors are superb and the charisma and charm of this film are undeniable. It is and will remain one of my favorite films. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind captures all that I long for in a movie. So go watch it.\n",

      "Eternal sunshine on the spotless mind is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. What is it that makes it so unique? The most important thing is that the dialog is so utterly realistic and believable that you cannot help getting the movie under your skin.Just consider one of the dialogs that gave me goose pimples. This dialog takes place when they both realize the memory will soon be gone:Clementine: This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon. Joel: I know. Clementine: What do we do? Joel: Enjoy it. Or just consider this dialog that took place after Joel had abandoned Clem in one of their first memories together:Clementine: I wish you had stayed. Joel: I wish I had stayed to. I swear to god I wish I had stayed. I wish I had done a lot of things. I wish... I wish I had stayed. Clementine: Joel? What if you stayed this time?I have truly never experienced a movie that came this close to portraying real life. The feelings were so utterly realistic that I could not help crying. What a truly magical and beautiful movie.It makes me think of one of my favorite songs of all time, \"At my most beautiful\" by R.E.M. What makes this song so fantastic. It's the believability that we can all relate to:I read bad poetry into your machine // I save your messages just to hear your voice // you always listen carefully to awkward rhymes // you always say your name // like I wouldn't know it's you // at your most beautiful.\"The most beautiful art is the one that touches you deep in the heart because it catches the most important aspects of the human condition. Eternal sunshine is one of those films. In fact, when I compare the film to the 500 other films on my ratings list, they do not reach it. It is simply the best movie of all time.\n",
      "911\n",
      "what can i say that hasn't been said about this film? probably nothing, coming so late to the party. however, i will say this: like \"Memento,\" this film deploys an inventive technical approach to the storytelling (time shifts, surreal editing and soundtrack effects, etc) that are decidedly NOT gimmicky. in the hands of lesser storytellers, devices such as these can come off as needlessly \"film school-ish\" or simply confusing. here, however, form and content -- directing and scriptwriting -- compliment each other PERFECTLY. the WAY the story is told is integral, essential to the story itself; and vice versa.add to the above the fact that charlie kaufmann has truly hit his stride with this film. which is not to say that he has not produced excellent work in the past -- \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\" are both outstanding movies. However, \"Eternal Sunshine\" adds an enormous, non-schmaltzy, non-rom-com element of HEART to kaufmann's usual bag of tricks (surreal story, highly inventive plotting, sparkly dialogue). the result is a masterpiece, the clear movie of the year. of course, that means it wasn't even nominated for that honor. (nor, for that matter, was the year's SECOND best film, \"Farenheit 911.\") and add to both of the above, truly outstanding performances by both leads, Kate Winslet (deservedly nominated for an Academy Award) and Jim Carrey (once again snubbed, despite showing enormous depth and a gentle touch that could not contrast more with his over-the-top antics in his straight comedic roles). Winslet OUGHT to win this award, but i fear she will not. basically, the film is just TOO WEIRD for the largely staid membership in the Academy. Which is too bad, this kind of work should be recognized and encouraged. Winslet and Carrey took enormous pay cuts (Carrey was working for peanuts, compared to what he could command in a mindless slapstick role) in order to produce some excellent work. Good for them -- I wish they were both recognized and rewarded for their efforts. One day, we may look back on Jim Carrey's body of work the way we do Bill Murray's, and just shake our heads ruefully, knowing the Academy's prejudice against comedies and comedic actors have robbed another talented performer of his just due. Hopefully, however, Carrey will continue to produce quality works like this one, long enough for the \"old guard\" to be replaced by younger, more open-minded judges. And when that day comes, Charlie Kauffman will also receive his due.\n",

      "I wont tell anything about the story because it's not easy for me to find the right words to describe the story proper, especially for someone speaking English as foreign language. Jim Carrey in one of his best movies. After Trueman-show he proves that he is a very good actor, so does Kate Winslet. This is a movie you like to watch two or three times and you will always find something you haven't noticed so far. I was thinking about it often after i watched it and i was overwhelmed with emotion. The cast of characters is also very good, i was surprised of Elijah wood. After seen this i ask myself why THIS movie is not nominated for an Oscar. Is it too deep for Hollywood ? Too much story ? This one proves that movies from America can be so beautiful and deep.\n",

      "I went to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with my girlfriend and I was amazed. This movie is the most unique since Pulp Fiction in my opinion. The story has great ways of switching scenes and the dialog is outstanding. The acting by Jim Carrey and especially Kate Winslet is the best either of them have ever given on screen. Its a pity this movie was released earlier in the year therefore a reason for not being nominated for the Big Oscar. The supporting cast, especially Kirsten Dunst are perfect side characters dealing with their problems too. I can not believe it was not nominated for best picture after seeing all of the nominees, even though I loved Million Dollar Baby. This movie is carried out by its original plot and heart wrenching romance. Even the way it was edited made it look delicious. This is the best movie I've seen in a long time, and if you see any of the Best Picture nominees, watch this and you'll wonder why? If you see any movie this year, Eternal Sunshine is the one to see. 10/10\n",

      "I think Eternal Sunshine is a great movie! When I first heard about it I thought \"oh, it's one of those overly hyped movies that I hate and will probably win tons of awards because Kate Winslet is in it.\" ex: Chicago- I thought it was awful, but it won so many awards. But that wasn't the case at all with this movie. I think it's entertaining and funny and has a good lesson that I think a lot of people will agree with. Of course I had to watch it 3 times to understand what was going on exactly. I'm glad I took the time to see this movie. How this movie came to my attention is because I found out Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunstand Jim Carrey, would be in it. I had to take a chance with my favorite actors, even though I didn't think I would like it. I'm glade my suspicions about this movie was wrong.\n",

      "This movie simply didn't work for me. Early on I was quite interested in the relationship between Joel and Clementine, but things began to slip once the memory erasers came into the movei. Finally, 55 minutes of the DVD was all I could take. Perhaps I just didn't understand it, but I gave up about half way through the nighttime memory erasing scene. I wasn't enjoying, nor understanding what the purpose of much of the craziness of the attendants to the erasing was supposed to mean. I don't understand how this can be #32 on the IMDb all time list, even as I agree with many of the movies above it.Reminded me of another, less highly rated movie, \"Barton Fink\". I know I should have liked it. I've loved most of the Coen brothers subsequent movies. Although I've been meaning to give that a 2nd try one of these days, I also only got about 2/3 of the way through it.\n",

      "I can't even begin to put into words the profound effect this film has had on me. From the direction, the photography, the screenplay, and above all, the acting, it's a near perfect score. By the time the credits had rolled, I already had an affection for the principle players, Clementine (Winslet), and Joel (Carrey), who have met on a train. We then find out later that Clementine has had Joel erased from her memory after an argument. Joel learns this, and decides he wants to do the same, only after the procedure has started, he is wishing that he did not go through with it, because he still loves her, and he does not want to lose his memories of her.Anyone who has ever had any type of long-term relationship will no doubt feel your heart strings tugged. It's a heavy picture, so if you're looking for something like 50 First Dates (similiar premise, almost), you will not find it here. As I stated before, this movie stayed with me for days after I watched it, and damn near brought me to tears every time.If you're reading this, then the accolades are many, to say the least, and well-deserved. I don't care if this movie does not get any Oscars. I don't care how many people dislike the scatter-shot inter-changing of events, and non-linear time-line. Give this one a chance. From the beautiful, yet haunting, opening theme, to the last shot, the viewer is brought into a dream (sometimes nightmare), that touches on that one thing that few movies can pull-off: real, human emotions.In parting, if you find the opening a bit drawn, please stay with this until the end. You'll be glad you did, and then you may want to watch it again to find things you didn't the first time around. As Joel says towards the end of the movie, \"Just.....wait....\" 10/10.\n",

      "I have seen this movie, and it was truly one of the big movies of the year, i wouldn't be surprised at all if Jim Carrey gets the Oscar for this movie, is truly convincing his role at the film, a character that goes to life thanks to Jim's effort to demonstrate that he could be \"a normal guy\" yes, that is what Joel Barrish is, just a normal guy, like me, like you, like most of the people here, a normal guy, with, a normal, boring, life until someday he thinks that he has discovered his reason to live, the love of his life, and he couldn't let it go that easy, this is point where all the movie starts to get life, the point about the love and the point about \"let it go\" those things that make us feel bad, or, maybe, nostalgic, the movie moves around those things and works really great, the result is a really good film, with awesome interpretations, and a very good script, that is why, i voted it like a 10, maybe, the only 10 point's movie of the 2004\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (the ESSM) is one of the ten greatest movies (and probably the most beautiful movie) I have ever seen. The other greatest are Almost Famous, American Beauty, Clockwork Orange, Magnolia, Mulholand Drive, Philadelphia, Pulp Fiction, Requem for a Dream and LOTR: The Return of the King. The ESSM has all three components that I believe great movies are supposed to have: great stories with great plot, great message and great acting.It might be difficult for one to understand its \"detailed\" stories with its non-linear plot when one sees the movie first. All its non-linear stories are centered on a message that it is important for one to look around (and appreciate) what one has in one's lover (or friend) during one's limited time. It is very difficult to see without tears Joel say \"I want to stay this time. I do.\" when Clementine asks \"You should stay.\" in their Montauk meeting in his last piece of memory for her. The ESSM put Jim's, Kate's and all the other actors' performances to their limits. I have enjoyed Jim's charismatic acting skills since I saw him in Mask first and I had to ask myself whether he was the same Jim who played Mask when I looked at his gigantic performance in the ESSM as a mentally challenged man of great imagination. Also, the ESSM blew away all my doubts from Titanic about Kate as an actress. Indeed, I just started to watch her other movies like Heavenly Creatures, realizing Titanic was her bad exception while the ESSM is her \"greatest\" norm. This is the movie that we aren't to see in many years to come. 10/10.\n",

      "With \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" director Gondry and screen-writer Kaufman (who previously teamed up on the little seen and fantastically funny film \"Human Nature\" starring Tim Robbins and Patricia Arquette) do for the romantic comedy genre what Christopher Nolan did for the mystery thriller in \"Memento\"--i.e. they totally deconstruct it with a gimmick plot trick (here we have characters employing a company called Lacuna that will erase their memories of each other), non-linear storytelling, and strip down the essence of the genre (in this case, relationships) to the bare bones to reveal startling truths about love and companionship. We also get treated here to Jim Carey doing his best post-\"Truman Show\" work to date and Kate Winslet delivering yet another astounding performance as our doomed and psychologically tortured lovers. We also have the luminous Kristen Dunst, the always reliable Mark Ruffalo, a delightfully out of character Elijah Wood, and old stalwart Tom Wilkinson in great supporting roles. This is one of those rare films where everything-- acting, writing, directing, and emotional involvement from the audience all come together beautifully. For all its seeming absurdity, it ends up being one of the most honest looks at relationships film has ever given us.\n",

      "OK, I admit I was quite skeptical about Jim Carrey's direction in \"serious\" roles when The Truman Show and Majestic came out. I wasn't hateful like all other people were, 'cuz they're unappreciative jack-#sses. When I heard about this movie, I was like.....whoa...This guy's incredible. A simple concept turned so surreal yet it works out so well. It was simply amazing in my part and I recommend it to too many people.It really seems that this is a film that is a one-or-the-other situation; you either hate it or you love it. I loved it. And I'm guessin' that those who hated it are people who are too lenient and likes straightforward linear plots and hates roller-coaster settings. Well get used to it. Don't listen to those other haters, because this is a simply beautiful movie that should not be overlooked at all. It deserves praise, and I mean a lot of it. Anyone who undermines Carrey's role in this film is a seriously biased individual who has only appreciation for his comedic talents and not his amazingly serious ones. Just watch this and you'll see what I mean...\n",

      "okay I don't know what I was expecting but this surpasses it....it starts off as quite a bit of a comedy but then it changes to a cross between Jacobs ladder and the standard romantic comedy if u can rap your head around that. I feel this film is made by the central performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who are to say the least phenomenal. I actually thought that the supporting cast was underused as they are all good. And I loved the ending. I would have loved to have seen this in the cinema so I could have experienced the full audio and visual experience of this gorgeous film. 10/10 this film is the ultimate romantic comedy.\n",

      "My wife asked this early in the movie. She's not a Jim Carrey fan, or a fan of nonlinear movies, so she left early on to do something else. At the beginning of the film, there were four of us watching it: My son and his wife, my wife and I. By the end of the movie, it was just my son and me.I was trained initially as a biopsychologist, so the basic premise of this movie really appealed to me. Is it possible to erase a person's memories of some person or events? If so, how would it be done? By the way, the name of the memory-erasing outfit in the movie is Lacuna, Inc., or something of the sort. Lacuna is a hole, like a hole in your hearing, or a hole in your memory.I thought the acting was great in the movie, particularly Carrey and Winslett, both actors I like to watch. All in all, I found the movie haunting and wouldn't mind watching it again, something I rarely do with movies. After all, there are so many I haven't seen that I don't want to waste what time I have left in life revisiting movies I've already seen--unless it's \"The Usual Suspects,\" or \"Brazil,\" or \"12 Monkeys,\" or . . . . What the hell, it's obvious there are lots of movies I would want to see again, and again, and . . . .I also really liked \"Adaptation,\" which I gather is by the same writer. If you like movies that'll make you think, check this one out.\n",

      "This was a movie I rented \"just for the heck of it,\" and ended up being very surprised and pleased. Now this seems a movie that people are going to love or they are going to hate. There doesn't seem to be a lot of middle ground with the people I have talked to.Some people liked this movie because it seems crazy. I am not one of them. Although, I liked this movie, I don't like movies that are crazy just for the sake of being crazy. I felt the plot and storyline in Sunshine, although common to us all, was told in a very unique way. Likewise, the colors and camera shots were done quite well. Although, I'm not anti-cgi, it's nice to know that not all directors have to rely on it as a crutch and can still be creative with a camera.All that said, this movie is probably not for everybody. If you're not into film or don't like a movie that probes deeper though, stick with something a little more straightforwad. As for me, I give it an A.\n",
      "924\n",
      "Charlie Kaufmann is a brilliant writer but I personally don't feel that either \"Adaptation\" or \"Being John Malkovich\" has anything like the heart of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". I think the reason is both Goudy's innovative visual direction, the script, and most importantly, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who are both brilliant, Winslet in particular, who I feel ought to earn an Oscar nomination for this film. It's too bad no one went to see it. It may not in fact be entirely possible to watch this film and not fall in love with Winslet's impulsive and passionate Clemetine. Like all of Kaufmann's stuff, there are moments of high school English class-ishness in some of his dialogue and plot, particularly as Carrey and Winslet are running away from the \"erasers\" in the mid point of this film, which I found to be the dragging point. But Carrey and Winslet carry the film so beautifully it's easy to forgive any shortcomings.\n",
      "925\n",
      "I can't say anything that hasn't been said by critics and IMDb users already. This movie has an underlining message that I personally believe in; the importance of memories. This movie would not moved me has much without Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. What a performance from both great actors! The hidden visuals effects are a special treat for the audience. Some scene will move you to tears. I believe this movie has a message that everybody (will) understand. In a technical view of this movie, the lighting is unbelievable. The street lamps and car meter lights work to add a realistic feel to the film. The soundtrack to the movie is equally stunning. An excellent compilation of music by the composer and bands like The Willowz and Beck. 10/10\n",
      "926\n",
      "If you hated Being John Malkovich and Adaption avoid this movie. If you love these movies you're in for a treat. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is complex as the other Kaufman flicks, intellectual as them but infinitely more touching. It is a philosophical meditation on the worth of memories. Yes, it is a film even more out of bounds than Being John Malkovich, masterly edited by the way, but it transports genuine feeling due to the fine acting by Jim Carrey (who I loathed in Liar, Liar), Kate Winslet (one of the ten best actresses of our time and maybe of the entire history of film) and Kirsten Dunst. Rent it, watch it, watch it again, watch it a third time, call your lover and say things you always wanted to say but were to shy to do it. After this movie you won't want to waste time any longer.\n",

      "Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman caught my attention with \"Human Nature\", which became one of my favourite movies instantly. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" deals with the deepest emotions, and a variety everyday problems in terms of relationships with such ease and yet such well-placed and thoughtful precision, that I have never seen or read before.Each and every bit, tiny crumb that You see on the screen, plays a part, and tells its own little story. Nothing is \"just filling\" nothing is in vain, there's nothing that doesn't serve Gondry's beautiful, heart-capturing way of storytelling.Breathtakingly cinematographed, packed with fresh and bright ideas never before seen, (in fact this movie has more unique ideas featured - visual and dramaturgical as well - than 10-12 \"average\" films) this film is really worth watching over and over again. Carrey is excellent, really showing what a marvelous actor he is. Kate Winslet became one of my favourite actresses because of this movie. The \"acting stunts\" she pulls in this film really are worthy of attention. The movie really has an exceptionally fine cast overall, with Wood and Dunst giving their best performances to date.It was great to see, what a very inspiring crew can do to the actors: their performances reflect the delight of having the opportunity to work with such geniuses as Gondry and Kaufman.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind became my No.1. favourite movie, and I doubt that it will ever lose this position. If it might ever occur, I won't be surprised if yet another Gondry-Kaufman piece would eventually take over its place.\n",

      "Spoilers included.Obviously every since BJM arrived on the scene, everyone is now curious about anything Kaufman does. Not so long ago I saw Adaptation, which had some nice quirks, but was ultimately a boring failure. I also saw Human Nature, better than Adaptation, but nothing great (apart from the gorgeous Patricia Arquette).I heard good things about ESoaSM, so recently went to see it. It is certainly well made and the camera work, lighting and acting are all top notch. The problem I had was the story. OK the twist at the end, if you can call it that, was good and something I didn't see coming, but in between the beginning and end is a lot of fluff. Yes I got the picture Joel had a relationship with Clementine and starts to remember all the good stuff. The little sub-plot with Kirsten and her boss held some interest, but not enough for about an hour of film. I got seriously bored during the middle of the film. Are you people really interesting in seeing some sappy love story told by showing scene after scene, after scene of some personal moments.As I said I liked the beginning, I liked the twist, but there just wasn't enough to create that much interest the film, ultimately a dull and un-interesting story. 5/10.\n",
      "929\n",
      "This movie is by far one of the most unique cinematic experiences you will ever witness. The premise is that Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), a rather average man in his late 30's, discovers that his impulsive, younger girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had her memory cleansed of any trace of him just before Valentine's Day. Upon his discovery, Joel decides to have the procedure done to himself so that he may be free of Clementine, but while he's reliving these memories as they're being deleted, he realizes that he doesn't want it anymore. The supporting cast is comprised of the team from Lacuna, Inc. By the way, this is the first movie where Kirsten Dunst has actually seemed to act and act well. Charlie Kaufman's bizarre, yet ultimately touching script will leave you recounting all of your past loves, while Michel Gondry's inventive techniques will leave you in awe. My favorite movie ever.\n",

Remarkable lines. Beautiful and strange love story. I like very much every character, Carrey is a new Carrey, the best, and Winslet is astonishing one more time, one for the other. Every actor or actress in this film is a gem. And, if you've once been in love, I'm sure you'll finally be touched. Again, Kauffman a genius, and an excellent direction by Gondry. Please see it, you will be gratefully shocked by this mad, sweet, original new story. I like to memorize some lines of the script, specially that one of \"Pope Alexander\" (: Alexander Pope.\n",

      "This is probably one of the best films that I have seen this year.I must first congratulate Charlie Kaufman for his wonderful screenplay. Much like his previous work, Kaufman's screenplay is both original and thought-provoking. Although the story is generally not as complex as Adaptation, it does convey a more emotional message to its audience. The movie depicts the true nature of love and relationships in the reality. It does a tremendously better job than many romantic comedies and dramas in conveying this material, which is rather funny since the movie is more of a science fiction movie. Michael Gondry's direction is great in conveying the insanity portrayed in Kaufman's screenplay. Every shot is wonderful.The acting is spectacular. Jim Carrey's talent shines in this movie. Although he displays some of his trademark comedic personality in the film, he also does a fantastic job in conveying the serious and self-loathing personality of his character. A good example of this is when the beginning credits roll and his character, Joel, is crying in his car. The pain in his character is very evident. Kate Winslet also does a great job in playing the impulsive and emotionally unbalanced Clementine. She does a wonderful job at portraying the negative aspects of her character in Joel's bad memories, as well as the positive aspects of her character in Joel's good memories. The supporting cast is also great.The soundtrack is amazing. The song that first plays in the beginning credits invokes a very powerful feeling of despair. And yet, as the same song plays again in the end credits, it produces a feeling that somehow opposes the feeling of despair. Throughout the movie, the musics helps to instill both laughter and insanity in the audience.All in all, I gave this movie a nine. The movie affected me rather deeply. I watched the movie about six times when it playing in the theaters, and I will definitely buy the DVD.\n",

      "What was that? Sure, the sets were cool. The concept was also unique. But being artsy for the sake of being artsy can leave a project in a mess. This was one convoluted movie. I found it to be original, but certainly not brilliant. It had the potential to be a lot more. The main drawback of \"The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" was the sloooow deadpan pace of the film. This movie was in desperate need of more humor. In fact, the few humorous moments were the highlight of the whole darn thing. It also needed to ditch the subplots - very boring - and spend more time on the romance or in Jim Carrey's mind. Charlie Kaufmann had a great concept, but I can't say he delivered. Elijah Wood is also going to have a tough time excelling at not being Frodo. I guess I just don't relate to the awe some reviewers got from this movie. Being bizarre cannot alone a great film make. It also has to hold one's interest. To compare to another recent fantasy type film, I thought \"Big Fish\" was better. 5/10\n",

      "***** Slight spoilers contained herein *****     A lot of people like this movie, but seem to be confused.  It's easy to see why you can get confused, but it really isn't that confusing.  At the beginning, Joel (Carrey) leaves his home to find his car dented, & ends up taking the train & seems aimlessly lead to the beach.  On his way, he meet's Clementine (Winslett) & seems again, aimlessly drawn to her.  They speak & hit it off instantly!  They get along so well that, as a movie viewer, it is somewhat confusing.  Because after their encounter that day & the following sequence, the next scene shows him go to her job, but she doesn't know him & he is obviously hurt.  But what needs to be understood is, when the movie actually starts off, it is **AFTER** both Joel & Clementine have had their memories erased.       The key to this is Elijah Wood.  He works at the clinic & meets Clementine when she goes there to have her memory erased.  But he shows up at her house the day after Joel meet's her at the beginning of the movie & is wondering what Joel is doing there!   Elijah Wood's character is your clue that this is after both have had their minds erased.  She doesn't know why Elijah Wood is so drawn to her, but she doesn't really like him. & Neither she nor Joel understand why they are so drawn to each other.  They have an undeniable kinship even thou they apparently just met.  The other key to understand this is the twist at the end with the doctor. (All I'm going to say)  But when that scenario plays out, it is basically explained that the mind erasure procedure is not perfect.  It can't erase your lower, subconscious brain.  Thus, Joel & Clementine know each other, thou they don't recognize each other.       That is what makes this movie so good.  This is very realistic in my humble opinion.   We don't know enough about the brain to dig deep into the subconscious subsystems of our brains, but the mind erasure procedure is pretty simple to understand.  They don't go deep.  They have you bring in everything you own that reminds you of the person, & then discuss each thing & explain how you feel about the relationship & the other person.  During which, they do a cat scan on your brain & analyze the area's of your brain that are reacting!  They have you explain the pieces in order, so they can make a road map thru your mind, & basically damage each small section in order.  Erasing the all memories of this person.  But this is all pretty much visual memory! So, you don't know the person physically or consciously.      Now think back to old relationships.   There are foods or smells or places that you have fond feelings for or can put you in a good mood, but you don't consciously know why.  You have to think about it, & then it dawns on you the thing reminds you of some person you used to know...  but what if you couldn't possibly remember that person.  Only the subconscious feeling would be left.  Thou unexplained, you would feel drawn to this smell or place or thing... OR PERSON.        I wish this could be real...  This would be so great for all our long-term relationships...  if we could erase all the pain & anguish, but still keep the feeling of kinship to the person, & start over.  That would be great wouldn't it?  This is the statement the movie made to me!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, & will be buying it the day it is released on DVD. \n",

      "This is the first Charlie Kaufman film I've seen. I've heard it's his most accessible, which puts me off watching his other films. I couldn't understand this film. Not in a way like Inception where it was clearly organised, in a way that seemed that the director himself didn't know what the script meant. The acting, however, was superb. Jim Carey puts out a performance that I love - I love when actors usually stuck in the same role completely change it up- like Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems or Burt Reynolds in Deliverance. Kate Winslet was also very good, but the great performances don't stop this from being messy.\n",

      "Interestingly, as the film scripts of Charlie Kaufman have gotten praised through the roof over the last several years, with comparisons ranging to Herman Mankiewicz, Robert Towne, Paul Schrader, and Paddy Chayefsky- at least in terms of recognizability, most writers I have known have been far less impressed with his solipsistically obsessed screenplays than the general public.I think that is because that any reader of fiction or poetry in the last 40 or so years has been so inundated with puerile post-modernism that self-referential tautologies fail to impress. This is the fourth CK-scripted film I've seen and easily the best film was that he adapted from an outside source- the film of Chuck Barris's autobiography Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind- directed by George Clooney. That's because, given the source, CK was forced to stay on track and not veer back into his own ego like the Titanic to the- You get what I mean. His first filmed screenplay, Being John Malkovich, was a cute humorous fable- not too deep, nor too troubling. His second scripted film, Adaptation, was merely a banal recapitulation of themes laid out in the first film, yet with the added baggage of destroying a potentially interesting film with a last third larded with the neuroses of writer's block raised to epopee. No, not really, but the attempt was embarrassing. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind explores similar areas of memory and mind far better, although the film has some notable flaws. I grade it as a 75 out of 100- good, but nowhere near the great rankings many critics bestowed upon it¬Ö",
      ".However, this is still the best CK film based on his original script. The problem is that his 'original' scripts are all mere slight tangents on the same tired theme. Too bad, because a better, more original screenwriter would have laid the template for a truly great film, not just a muddling repeat viewing of a maculate mind unlighted.\n",

      "'04s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Directed by Michel Gondry and Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman; Starring Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst\"Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004. Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies.. to make people feel like crap.\"The first line of the movie.. and pretty much the one line, that I think, sums the beginning of this movie up. Director Michel Gondry really cooks up a visual feast for the eyes in this one, along side screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malcovich, Adaptation, etc) who never fails in writing an off the wall movie. Most movies of our time, are filled with too over the top CGI, where as Gondry's style of direction, is standing alone. Not many directors out there, put the theory of camera tricks in their films.. especially those directors that have just a cinematographer doing the work for them. Not that any of them are bad, but directors who put a lot of stock into their vision, get the best results.Eternal Sunshine is a movie about two thirty-somethings, Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski, played by comedic genius Jim Carrey and actress Kate Winslet. These two endure love, disagreement, and pain (in that order) over a 2 year period and begin to grow tired of one another. This movie forces us to ask ourselves, \"If we could, would we have certain memories erased from our brains, to stop the pain that we experience when losing a loved one?\" This is the movie's main concept, which works very well, being that it's relate-able to most human beings.The brains behind this possibility, is Lacuna LTD., a surgical clinic ran by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). After a tough breakup, Clementine finds Dr. Mierzwiak, and what he does. And being the impulsive person that she is, she decides on the surgery. Sometime after this, Joel goes to Barnes and Noble where Clementine works, and is baffled to find her ignoring him and there with another guy.Being torn by this, he takes comfort with two friends of theirs, Rob and Carrie. While Carrie is trying to explain to Joel, why Clementine is the way she is, her and Rob get into a fight over a very important piece of paper, that Rob gets out of a near-by dresser drawer.Dear Rob and Carrie Eakin:Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her memory. Please never mention their relationship to her again. Thank you.LACUNA, LTD. 424 GRAND STREET, NY, NYAfter reading this card, Joel confronts Lacuna, and is in disbelief of what is said. After he leaves, he stresses over Clementine, and cannot believe she'd do something like this. Not knowing what to do, he decides to go through with this procedure as well. As he forces himself into Dr. Mierzwiak's office, his assistant Mary (Kirsten Dunst) tries to stop him, and insist he wait in the waiting room. Joel cuts her off by saying, \"Okay, I want it done, Now!\"They record Joel talk about the history of him and Clementine, and easily make a map of his brain activity, by having Joel react to everything he owns that has some association with Clementine. Joel: \"Is there any risk of brain damage?\"Dr. Mierzwiak: \"Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.\"Let the mind trip ensue, because here is where Michel Gondry's brilliant directing style shines. Never before have I seen a film directed like this, nor have I ever saw a film that got so much out of its characters in only a couple of hours. It's like watching a book, in that it has so much detail, you'll be dazzled.The score constructed by Jon Brion and is something to talk about. With it's heartwarming, robotic like, piano notes and it's acoustic bass & guitars, to the tracks written by some of today's pop icons, Beck and Polyphonic Spree. Beck contributes only one song, titled \"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime\", which I think counteracts very well with this film.This film will touch you unlike any film in the world, and will force you to rethink some of your most cherished memories of your loved ones. This film may confuse you, but you'll be left wanted to watch it again and again and in doing so, you'll find out things that you didn't the first time.This is by far my favorite film, and my first movie review, so I hope I've lifted some eyebrows, and caught some of your attention, because like God, this is something to share to everyone I know.Happy Watching, Brok SpikerQuotes from The Newmarket Shooting Script series for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\n",

      "It's hard not to fall in love with a film that begins with a voice-over saying (paraphrasing): \"Valentine's Day was created by card companies to make everybody feel like crap.\" Right afterward, I watched Jim Carrey force himself through a half-closed train door, and I said, this is for me.Carrey, in a complete turnabout, plays Joel, a lonely man who falls in love with a lively, quirky nut named Clementine. The romance progresses, fights ensue, and one day, Joel walks into the bookstore where Clementine works, and she's making out with someone else and doesn't seem to even recognize him. Then their friends receive a note saying that Clementine has erased Joel from her memory, and they shouldn't mention him again. Joel heads to the clinic himself to find out what's going on. There he finds programmers who can draw a map of your memories about an individual on the brain and get rid of them. Joel decides to have the procedure. Part of the way through it, he tries desperately to stop it, to find some way to remember Clementine, bringing her into places and memories where she never was. The programmers (Elijah Wood, Thomas Ryan) don't notice anything odd about the procedure because they're busy drinking, dancing in their underwear and doing drugs with Mary (Kirsten Dunst) a secretary at the clinic. When they finally notice a problem, the head man (Howard Wilkinson) is called in. Slowly Clementine disappears from Joel's brain as he desperately tries to hold onto her.A spectacular story with a few twists along the way, and spectacular acting, particularly from Carrey, Winslet and Dunst, make this a real winner. Carrey is a sympathetic, warm character, Winslet is adorable and charming, and Dunst is a complete natural, be she stoned in her underwear, trying to talk sense under the influence, or crying. They are wonderful as is the rest of the cast.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is about the death of memory but not of emotion and the cry of the heart that goes on - sometimes without knowing why. A beautiful, beautiful film.\n",

      "I signed up for IMDb specifically for the purpose of telling people how amazing this movie is. It is so beautiful, deep, and meaningful; it is so powerful and it makes you think very hard about love. Jim Carrey shows a side of himself that really hasn't been fully developed before, and Kate Winslet is amazing as well. With a great supporting cast and the absolute best (no exaggeration) plot of all time, I cannot stress how wonderful this movie is. It is a must-see in the true meaning of the word. The only reason it is rated so low is that a lot of people rated it \"1\" just as a joke. Although it is sort of hard to understand due to the non-chronological order, the ending ties everything up extremely well, and wraps up an extraordinary piece of art.\n",

      "\"VIRUSED\" CINEMAFor 30 years ago, the cinema was \"virused\" by a new current of movies. Some of us called them as postmodern movies (by the growing of the sens of the already existent concept), others ¬ñ surrealist movies (seen them as adventure of the imagination). These movies are distinguished from other types of movie by deconstruction of our preconceptions and/or by construction of others for a new vision of current reality. It seams that the good way to describe better these kind of movies is to \"catalogue\" as \"weird\" because we are introduced in a world strange to us, perceiving socio-cultural values & norms suggested by director and adapted to the reality from our days.I would like to invite you to be part of a love story created by Charlie Kaufman (screenplay) and miss-en-scene by Michel Gondry (director) in the movie - \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless of Mind\" ¬ñ in a new vision, absolute originally¬Ö",
      " postmodern.The post-modernism could be consider as a virus which destroys anything is considered conventionally, making his presence when you at least expected and in a variety ways. This current lives in detail, but you can understand and combat it only if you know/have the \"soft\" of our society.The first sign of virus appears in the title of the movie ¬ñ by keeping with difficulty in mind this title, it is too big ¬ñ continuing his itinerary in the movie's theme: by the reverse rewinding of relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) by flashback during the memories are deleted from Joel's mind by Lacuna team (company specialized in erasing memory).The next victim is the subject of the movie becoming totally weird and complicated ¬ñ in first credits, there is presented naturally the beginning of a relationship between Joel and Clementine until to the dramatic moment of erasing memory of the girl from his mind. When Joel found out, he was completely overwhelmed with grief and the pain ordered him to do the same thing. When Joel is submitted to the erasure memory procedure, the tumultuously love story rewinds in front of our eyes, thus becoming witnesses of attractive and captivating memories. These moments are forgotten in order to reappear moments full of tenderness and optimism, causing Joel to fall in love again of Clementine, even if he knows he can't stay with her anymore, trying to hide memories with her in the most his humility memories of childhood. The relationship begins with boring moments when two persons usually passed through and it finishes with those moments from the beginning when they felt attractive on each other, in order to start to be together again and to know how the relation is going on.The movie was achieved by using very little special and artificial technicals, being approach to a documentary (movie). There were used simple effects (from the beginning of cinema), optic illusions etc. the memories were created from small parts, fragments, impressions, the scenes and the characters being combined in a impressionist way. The physic disappear of Joel's tangible memories were achieved in a practical way, often through removing of some pieces from decor.Willing everything to seam much real and gripping, the director Michel Gondry decided not to be so important Lacuna company which used special equipment of erasing memory ¬ñ another postmodern element ¬ñ in order not seam a SF movie.The time is affected by the devision in 2 simultaneously temporal axis: all secondary characters live their little stories which happened all of its in one night unlike the story of Joel and Clementine which goes on during 2 years. The first axis goes on the future and the second to past.Script, production/direction, cutting, variety of the scenes etc and performance of the actors help us to perceive the value of the memories full of suffering and also of the great memories of a love story.\n",

Another thing is that not even the music helps in making this more interesting. I think the rating is far too high for what I expected... In my opinion, it deserves a 6.5 on the best.

I didn't like Kate Winslet's character, and I especially didn't see why Jim Carrey's character was so in to her. Also, the twist ending, about how the beginning of the movie was really the end, I saw coming a mile away.One last thing, I think Charlie Kaufman is getting way too much attention.

What a crime.Michel Gondry's direction is also brilliant.

I will give it 4 of 4 stars, and have no negative feedback less the unnecessary use of the F-Bomb more than a few times. The only other movie I have ever seen that even remotely relates to the way this one was filmed would be \"Brazil\" or the one with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman (from a filming standpoint ONLY).

I wouldn't remember that whole thing with Michael Jackson, but I could explain geopolitics.

Normally a disk defect like that would be annoying, but for the first time while watching a movie, I was not too unhappy that it happened. One more comment about Jim Carrey. He should definitely stick to making comedies. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.Enough said!\n",

      "I had to stop watching it after 15 minutes because I couldn't bear Carey and Winslett's characters any longer. He's a sad wimp of a man - a real loser, and she's a neurotic idiot with a collection of potato heads. The idea that a pretty woman would for one minute make the first approach on such a wimpy man has been played out in a few films I've watched and it's totally unreal and highly unlikely to happen in real life, so as soon as they start that one up I usually lose interest pretty quickly (even worse is when, he's not just a sad loser, but also 25 years her senior like in the movie 'The Girl In The Cafe' with Billy Nighy and Kelly Mcdonald - about as likely to happen in real life as spiders landing on earth from mars..),\n",

Looks like this movie is trying to force us to like lower quality possible partner and accept it even if we don't like it. And it won't succeed doing that to me. Some boring story about ordinary relationship of ordinary people. Sci-fi part is unrealistic and negative. Looks like some disease, flu, pandemic, somebody messing with somebody or somebody drunk or somebody taking drugs or somebody just having a dream. Trying to show us something so typical and simple such as boring ordinary girl in too complicated and special way. Not funny, not clear, not interesting.\n",

      "I was taken aback by the almost perfect script Charlie Kaufman wrote for \"Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind\", he really knows more about the human psyche than any of the top therapists in the world. Even though his first collaboration with director Michel Gondry was met with unflattering opinions, their second time around was struck gold due to their gaining experience and getting a better understanding of building characters and adding dimensions to them.Every scene just seems to weave perfectly albeit in a non-linear fashion. When the beach house falls apart really brought the house down at the theatres because every shot is handled with the greatest of care. It may look like a simple hand held camera direction featured here, but the scenes play out subliminally in similar veins to that like \"Adaptation\" and \"Being John Malkovich\". The visuals created by Gondry were aimed primarily to himself and are planned out to draw self-attention and is not intended to be a distraction to take the audience off guard. The CGI scenes may look awkward, but were put there for the sake of being comical (scenes with the boy and Elijah Wood's head turning when he's at the Barnes & Noble) and also borders on a bit of horror like the scenes of the expunged faces in the dark in the doctor's residence.There are many scenes and subplots from the movie and they were handled splendidly, they felt very real and organic as though they weren't just reading off of a script. For example the awkward relationship between Kirsten Dunst's Mary Svevo and her colleague Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and how he wanted to conceal their relationship by erasing her from his mind. Another more prominent scene that works so organically real is Patrick Wertz's (Wood) stepping up to take the opportunity experience love and the baggage that comes with when he forms a relationship with Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) . Not that he felt he was a better boyfriend to Clem than Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), but to get a better understanding of what it's like to be in love, some thing he has never felt before. An interesting thing about this movie is that the residences of each of the characters live symbolize the person of who they are. Joel's apartment stands out as being extremely mundane and moody which is symbolic to the fact that a lot of the memories he had Clem are gone and that the memories he had with her are ones he would've liked to keep both good or bad.If there's anyone who understands the artistic merit behind pain and regret it is Charlie Kaufman. We as humans can learn from our errors in life and how we can take this errors and go the easy way like Clem and move forward with our life and forget about our past. Or we can keep things in our past, look into the present for a solution and try to hope for the future ahead to what Joel did. Sure in the end Clem and Joel are back together again and have rekindled their relationship. They seem to be made for each other because of the cliched and very real opposites attract alibi. And sure they're relationship has rekindled, we know that they're not the perfect couple. They will fight, they might lose their tempers, but one thing guaranteed, they will find themselves back in each other's arms once again and they might drift apart again. To get a better understanding about the relationship between Joel and Clem is to have experienced what they've been through and you have to live in the shoes of both leading characters. There are plenty of people like Joel who'll find true love to someone who's spontaneous and free-spirited and sadly will want to move forward to find someone else due to her boredom with the Joel in her life and would like to start a new slate in her life while throwing away the life that she once knew. Sure unexpected breakup's can be painful and upsetting, but it's worth it because it has the feeling of adventure in making the effort to fall in love with someone who will love you at first and then unexpectedly erase you from your memory. The good side of love and the bad part of it is equally divided for the feeling of love gives you that feeling that you do exist in this world and to counteract that acclaim, we know that the emotional hurt is there, but it was worth it. It's better to experience love rather than to stir away from it as a whole.\n",

      "Like Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry is an extremely talented director. To be able to make this film come to life isn't easy and Gondry managed to capture the heartfelt and emotional weight of Kaufman's script beautifully. The way this film is told is very interesting. The film's narrative goes back and forth a lot and has multiple surreal moments which is what makes this romance unlike any other. The characters are extremely well realised and the performances to go along with it are excellent.Eternal Sunshine shows a side of Jim Carrey which we've never been exposed to. We've all known him for his over-the-top and comedic personality but he's never done a role as serious and restrained as Joel Barish. Carrey is absolutely superb here and makes his character as relatable, realistic and human as possible. He should have got a Best Actor nomination at least. This is his best film along with The Truman Show. Kate Winslet has never been better. Her chemistry with Carrey is believable to its core and she deserves her Best Actress nomination. The supporting cast with the likes of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson were also terrific in their roles.\n",
      "968\n",
      "Besides a pretentious title, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" has a lot going for it. Mainly, a terrific performance by Jim Carrey. Carrey really does a nice job. The rest of the cast is pretty good but, with the exception of Kate Winslet, they're not given a lot to do. Winslet does a nice job and is not nearly as annoying as she usually is. The problem with \"...Spotless Mind\" is that it takes itself a little to seriously. If it wanted to be serious, I think they would have been better off being a straight science fiction movie. As a romance, the ending is telegraphed way too early. All that said, I still kind of liked this movie and I suspect I will like it a lot more the next time I see it. Dishonorable mention: showing Mark Ruffalo's butt and not Kirsten Dunst's.\n",

We all have our own experience in life and movies is what really bonds us, even this one does so better then any others I think. The acting is very good in Jim Carrey's serious role, he should have won the Oscar for this. Even my Dad likes this movie and we don't agree on much.

Watching it again at 23, I view \"Eternal Sunshine\" as a trippy masterpiece of emotional depth. This film brings alternative romance (if that's even a genre) to a new level. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both should of won oscars and the movie itself should of been best picture acknowledged. This film is a beautifully tender and dreamy experience that i will always regard as one of my favorites. A true gem.\n",

She's fully in and committed to the role. Best part of the movie. Unfortunately, didn't feel the same for Jim Carrey here. I wish I could see more Joel Barish (his character) than Jim Carrey but I saw the grimaces and it was hard to avoid.I was also pleasantly surprised with Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst performance.

      "This movie offends me on such a fundamental level that I wanted to give it a 0. But then I remembered some truly bad movies where it's obvious that none of the screenwriters, directors, or actors involved was actually making an effort. In my opinion, these are the kind of movies that deserve a zero score. In the case of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, it is clear that some of the creative personnel behind it were genuinely, and dare I say with great (albeit misguided) artistic passion, sensibility and integrity, trying to express something through it. That's why I gave it 3 stars, for effort.The reason I didn't like this movie is not because I found it confusing - I understood the plot perfectly, nor is it because I cannot suspend belief for a sci-fi twist - I've enjoyed many a sci-fi and fantasy movie in the past. What irks me the most is the kind of movies that present a sci-fi or fantasy premise, and then do not build on the premise in a logical or consistent way. Of course, some leeway and artistic license are always allowed, or even welcome, since movies sometimes can't and shouldn't be research-paper accurate. But if a movie veers too far away from logic and reason, without utilizing absurdity or parody as a deliberate artistic treatment, then it is just plain pointless and obtuse. And this is a movie that takes itself seriously. The problem is, if one is to entertain, somewhat seriously, the possibility of highly precise selective memory erasing technology, then the least interesting aspect would be to use it to salve relationship pains. Governments and secrets services would go crazy for this kind of technology for espionage, mind control, loyalty conversion, airtight non-disclosure procedure, and a million other usage scenarios. And people would freak out over the enormous ethical issue of invading the sanctity of one's mind. The only imaginary situation where such technology would be even remotely considered suitably justified would be to treat extremely severe case of PTSD, schizophrenia or depression perhaps. The world as we know it simply wouldn't be the same with this premise. To even suggest the idea that people would willingly erase their own memories just to alleviate romantic woes is an insult to the audience's intelligence.Imagine going into a movie knowing its premise revolves around a time machine that normal people could use for a fee, then finding out in this fantasy world, all the people only want to use the time machine to re-freeze their melted ice-cream, and nothing else. If it's a skit in a comedy, it might be funny. But this movie seems pretty serious about itself, which just makes it look like vacuous nonsense.\n",

      "In 95% of the cases my personal score is similar to that of IMDB. But not this one ... I actually tried to watch it once again, thinking there should be a correlation to the high score, and I just miss something. I survived 1 hour. It's an average drama, pretentious, boring, and chaotic. Too many switches between past-present-future. The characters are shallow, with bad personality. The really disappointing point is that it is a bad Sci-fi. In a Sci-fi film, I expect the director to make some effort to create an \"atmosphere\" of the future, or of alien biology environment different from ours (e.g., as in Avatar or Arrival). But everything in this film from 2004 makes you feel like you are in the 70's: the train station, the car, house, office, and the old laptop that is somehow used for a very advanced operation - manipulating our memories. Kubrick's Space Odyssey from 68 still looks authentic, but this film from 2004 takes you 30 years back. The film raises some interesting questions, but the plot is poor and it's badly directed. Still, some people seem to enjoy it, I just don't know why. If you want a good Sci-fi drama, watch Gattaca.\n",

Patrick was a jerk yeah, but I didn't really felt angry at him for going after Clementine. He was the type of person that you can't care enough.The movie was also too predictable after a while. There were really few \"WOW!\" moments, and not so very important.Finally, Clem and Joel relationship was not really lovable.

Michel Gondry's (He would later go on to make some downright atrocious movies like 'The Green Hornet') palate is incredible , so are the visual effects and acting (Titanic and The Hulk , anybody?).So if you've got 2 hours to spare on a long Sunday Afternoon, and wouldn't mind to be bored at places , you've got a movie to watch!\n",

      "Out of all the films made by beloved experimental French filmmaker Michel Gondry, none have ever gotten as much acclaim and recognition as this film. As this was a collaboration with modern screenwriting legend Charlie Kaufman, it has been regarded as one of the most original, touching, and downright unique movies of the 21st century. It is a film that explores both the mind and heart in a much deeper and thought provoking manner than most other films out there. \"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resigned.\" - Alexander Pope. This is the quote that the film stands by the most, and for good reason.The plot revolves around two former lovers named Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) who erase each other from their memories, but begin dating again soon afterwards. What really sells the film are these two main leads, even though they have different personalities. Joel is basically a nowhere man; he has no clue where he's going to but has trouble breaking out of his niche. In contrast, Clementine is much more free spirited, as she often does what she wants over what others say. When Joel tries to erase his memories of Clementine, he realizes that he'd rather have a relationship with flaws than no memory of her at all. Eternal Sunshine is mainly about the struggle to search for hidden feelings, and Joel's struggle to maintain them is enough to make one cry.In addition to great leads, the acting is simply marvelous. Jim Carrey proves here how he can act outside of his usual screwball antics, as he manages to create a sympathetic and earnest portrayal of an isolated man. Kate Winslet displays Clementine as an attention seeking wild one while also showing how lonely she truly is as well. Thanks to their believable performances, it's understandable to see why these two broke up yet still loved each other. The supporting cast is also quite fun, mainly with Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, and Mark Ruffalo as the eccentric team who run Lacuna, the facility that erases memories. Each character ends up having their own opinions about the process, and we learn more about some of them through the flaws of the facility itself, which helps to make their subplot relevant.Lastly, Michel Gondry's direction, Ellen Kuras' cinematography, and Vald√≠s √ìskarsd√≥ttir's editing craft the movie phenomenally. As a good chunk of the film takes inside Joel's head through the disappearance of his memories, plenty of visual effects flow on screen at a rapid pace, and they look astounding. Whenever Joel enters a memory of his past, the usage of placing him in the environment may showcase the occasional cinematic trick like forced perspective and compositing. I don't think the stylistic choices for the movie get nearly enough credit as the screenplay, for they help present the film with its own distinct identity from a visual standpoint. The way the film is shot should also be noted, as Kuras manages to display the grim nature of the real world and the surrealistic presence of one's inner workings wonderfully.Overall, Eternal Sunshine is not only a funny albeit realistic sci-fi dramedy in its own right, but it's also a very honest exploration of the mind when conflicting with love itself. The feeling may be painful when it comes to a relationship, but it can also be beautiful when reflecting upon oneself. Even if this film will make you reconsider your opinions about life, love and general memories, it will still hit home for the right reasons. Love is a very complicated word, as there has never been a relationship where there aren't as many downsides as there are upsides. So this is why I can say that this film may be one of the most believable love stories ever told, and nothing that it states is any half-assed effort.\n",

      "You would think that, after more than 100 years of depicting love stories in the screen, in every seemingly conceivable combination of style, tone and language, every combination would have been explored and new director would be forced to rehash something already tried.Apparently that wasn't a deterrent for the makers of Eternal Sunshine... since they managed to come up with something truly new. Most movies dealing with memory loss and mind control focus on violence, horror, the darker side of mind. This one reminds us that there is some room for love -not the saccharine type, but one that includes bitterness, fights and break ups. I don't recall rooting so hard for any star crossed movie lovers to reunite. No spoilers here, just note that the ending is solid and believable, without feeling forced or insincere.If the premise and the great imagery wasn't enough, there is Kate Winslet. I'm an old fashioned fan of Meryl Streep and Kate Hepburn, who tend to dismiss most of the over-hyped new generation of actresses (and actors too). I'm glad to say that Winslet belongs at the very top. She carries this movie. Not that Carrey doesn't do a good job -it's probably his best movie- but the weight of the acting is for once carried by the female lead.\n",

      "I know it really emotional, but I think cinema was invented to overcome inner hesitance and give our souls an emotional push.The eternal sunshine of any spotless things which we have will be true when we are calling and inviting it to be in action. Our collective modern life is really fragile and liquid so there is underestimation of our ability to overcome in our relations, we want to be happy and excited all the time and this is not the real truth about life in fact.Additionally, why it is shame of being fluent in a talkative conversation? why we can not practice the action of silence? why we can not gain our souls?I have this film twice; once in the adolescence time and then when I fall in love with an amazing elephant girl. The first one was exciting and thoughtful but, the second seems to be such like a babyish fear of dogs he can not previously outpace but now contain in his soul all braveness which existed in the universe from the stone age to the post-modernity. I love you. I love you despite my fears of death, dogs, competitions, being tested, being useless, long emotional translation processes , the palm tree of death where I used to nominate and play around as a child. I love you with all these fears and misgivings which I used to define as freezing points but now I am really appreciate.my love, Ahmed\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind will always have a special place in my heart, this movie is so beautiful and at the same time painfully sad. It shows how a relationship can be so fast-moving and make you not see the beauty of another person when you are with them. This movie will make you open your eyes and make you fall in love with it. It shows a realistic phase of a relationship from how you love someone head to toe from the start and how you hate them inside and out when the relationship is going downhill and about to end. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind will make you rethink on how you love a person and will make you want to understand them more and not give up on them. A movie that'll make you miss an ex lover even though you've never had one. A movie that'll make you regret on ever leaving an ex. A movie that will pluck your heartstrings and plain out make you cry and yearn for love. A movie that will make you love it until the end of your life.\n",

      "\"The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know.\" Pascal's famous quote exudes a sense of instant obviousness on the irrational aspect of love, love as feeling, love as a bridge between two souls¬Ö",
      " but once you dig deeper in that notion, you realize that it's not much about love being irrational but maybe of love being built on 'fantasy', as a euphemism for lies. We can love someone, this is a sentiment human beings are most capable of, but take love as something other than a feeling, as a contract, a commitment and then the word 'fantasy' takes its full meaning because only through a fantasized version of the other, one can sacrifice his freedom of being true to his and her nature, becoming a fantasy in return.I'm reading myself and I don't think I'm being clear. I think what Michel Gondry's movie or let's say the script written by Charlie Kauffman, who wrote \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation.\", is that the mind of someone is a world by itself, it is made of rational and irrational stuff, lost dreams and hopes, dreams and lost hopes, visions of reality, lies, regrets and more than anything memories, it's not much the memories that shape our individuality but the way we perceive them. By that logic, a relationship between two persons represent a real collision of two worlds, where hearts create bridges that minds have a hard time to cross. There's a moment in the film where Clementine says that she doesn't like what she became in her relationship with Joel, it's quite a powerful statement about the way love interfere with our being, and maybe the mind is the only sphere of freedom one is allowed to keep.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", the film that finally earned Kauffman a long overdue Oscar, allows us to venture in the mind of Joel Barish, a meek and timid young man played by Jim Carrey and who falls in love with Clementine, a free-spirited girl who feels a strange attraction, maybe a feeling of completion in that sponge of a man who allows her to be true to herself. The non-linear narrative makes us suspect that there might be a 'history' between these two souls, why would they meet during Valentine's Day, in a cold beach in Montauk. The credits come after about a quarter of an hour, when we're taken back in the past and realize that they indeed knew each other and because it didn't end happily, Clementine had registered to a program that allows to erase memories of failed relationships. Joel decides to follow the same program.And this is only the premise, the 'what if' question that drives the film. Kaufman is quite good in these starting concepts, what if we could live fifteen minutes in someone else's body, what if a film could chronicle the process of its own creation, what if we could erase memories? That's an existential challenge. I guess there are three or four memories that would totally change my personality if I erased them so yes, this is an issue I would strongly relate to, but in the case of \"Eternal\", the idea is more debatable, because love stories aren't meant to end well, so unless it ended with a crime or a rape, why would someone symbolically kill a person he or she loved. Maybe there's a sort of ego-thing, the idea of having lost your time, the desperation, the unhappiness, or maybe that sight of Carrey crying in his car. Love can make you feel lousy indeed.So Joel decides to follow the treatment and we see the medical staff operating on his brains and the film features a strange and somewhat comical situation where he's in a comatose state while the young assistants charged of mapping the brain spots featuring memories of Clementine to wipe them out, are having fun, drinking beer or even takes advantage on the situation in a way I wouldn't spoil, but let's say that Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson being actors and observers of the situation also bring a few insights about the way love works and about the way such a concept would be in fact a remedy worse than the cure itself, they're like the Greek chorus of a tragicomedy whose actions speak so vividly against that memories-erasing concept and you expect it's a matter of time before somewhere Joel feels the need to rebel.And the two thirds of the film are set in the mind of Joel who realizes while venturing in his memories that there's still something strong going between them, and that's the realistic approach of love, it's never as powerful as in the last memory so the more memories you explore, the more likely it is to awake old passions. What follows is an original cat-and-mouse chase in his labyrinthine mind. To a certain extent, It is a gimmick, I enjoyed it in the sense that it didn't overuse the dreamy concept and featured the kind of stuff I would have expected from \"Inception\", there were a few surrealistic bits that put Carrey in such situations that undermined the 'seriousness' of his role. He was good but just because he doesn't make grimaces doesn't mean he's pulling a great performance.There's no love but proof of love, only by seeing things that have been done in the name of love that they realized there was a true love, the ending was handled with poetic perfection, while the film was far from being imperfect. I know it is regarded as one of the best movies of the 2000's, but the plot wasn't as elaborate as Kaufman's usual creations and it's like the non-linear editing and overly long second act tried to make the film more complex than what it was, as if it was ashamed of being a straightforward romance of eighty minutes.\n",

      "Imagine that you are in your house, and you receive a letter in the mail saying \"A very close friend erased you from his memory\" from this argument that Charlie Kaufman creates a script that is much more than a simple script he is a study on beauty Of loving, reciprocating, hating and forgetting, entering the human psyche Charlie does not arrive at the limit of his idea, but he exposes and discusses it, in line with great technical concepts and great performances, we have a young cult who charms everyone, talk With most, and thrills some. Charlie Kaufman's screenplay tells the story of a world where there is a company called the gap, a company that erases people from their memories so that they do not suffer. In this world there are Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) A passionate couple who insist on forgetting each other, seems like a simple script, but he comes from a genius aligned with a complete simplicity that touches, from his argument Kaufman could elaborate a mega future, where several couples erase, the Consequences, etc, etc., etc. But not Kaufman simply tells the story of a couple in love. \"Eternal Brightness of a Mind Without Remembrance\" shows us the power of love, shows us the importance of pain, erase a person from memory and end suffering, is not evolutionary, we learn from pain, from suffering, even by erasing The memories come back to make the same mistake - As shown 2x in the film - we fall in love with the same people, because the feeling of love is beyond the comprehensible, this film is one of those that we should watch in different times of our lives that with certainty We will have completely different interpretations, it is a film that will survive the test of time, because its theme will always be and will always be a highlight because it is intrinsic to the human being, the eternal brightness of love will always shine in a mind, even if it does not know. We have many merits for Kaufman, but we can not forget Michel Gondry who can cinematically reproduce Kaufman's abstract script, with scenes that refer to Lynch, Michel uses and abuses the camera, with tight, focused plans, playing with light, blurring and Playing with the dimensionality of the screen, always maintaining a palette of blue colors, photography is the least camele√£o of the film, with a beautiful and unique soundtrack, it sends all the joy of the discovery mixed with the anguish and sadness of forgetfulness, despite the Confused time line, and to constantly lose its rhythm, and even to take away the climax created in its secondary history, the film technically enchants with its resources and translations of the human psyche, mainly because it is simple and real. It seems that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are changed, Jim making a focused and focused character and Kate making a laughable and funny character, fun, curious and cheerful, are 2 spectacular actors, Jin manages to pass an incredible dramatic charge, and Kate is gorgeous, In addition, we have a generally wonderful cast. We can conclude by saying that the film goes beyond a common cinematographic work, it appeals to the feeling, it not only appeals, it touches, it causes reflection, it is a film that we have to watch every 5 years, every stage of life, We will see how we will have different interpretations and reactions of the same, finally, we have a work that walks along the linear of the perfection.\n",

      "This is my favorite movie of all the times. I think is so deep and appealing. Personally, I love the way is told, it's not in a lineal way, it actually starts with the and and take us in a confuse journey through Joel's mind. Gondry is well know by his radical way to see the world and come to life his fantasies. One of the most interesting things of the movie is watching Kate Winslet doing a Jim Carrey's character, quirky, spontaneous, creative and in the other hand, Carrey is doing a character that fits more in the kind of role Winslet would play: shy, down to earth, dramatic. It's a very interesting mix of things you don't expect.\n",

      "Looking back at the content of this movie, I think it may have worked better as a short. The scenes of Joel forgetting Clementine and realizing that he doesn't want to forget her were interesting and had some pretty cool special effects, but thematically, I would have preferred less of them. The ending with Joel and Clementine finding out that they (SPOILER) have already had a failed relationship would probably have been just as effective if all of the memory erasure scenes had been cut. The emotional and relationship tendencies that the story explores are, I feel, the best aspect of it, although the more sci-fi elements were pretty good as well. It presents so many deep and universal points about the nature of relationships that I think are really important to hear. I didn't think it was entirely plausible that both couples that had their relationships destroyed by the Lacuna operation ended up falling in love after it took place, but I was okay with it. And it helped to support the awesome ending when Joel and Clementine agree that \"yes, we probably will find things we don't like about each other, but why not give it a shot?\".The movie was a little hard to watch because it was so disjointed. In the end it all pretty much made sense, but it just dragged a little. Still, the content was interesting enough and there were surprising enough complications to keep me interested. Plus, there were a bunch of interesting little lines interspersed. The characters were not the most intriguing of people even if they had some different life perspectives, but they had distinct personalities and were acted pretty well. It was nice to see a lot of big actors put into this smaller movie, which I guess speaks to how good of a story it is.I didn't feel like the script was totally stellar, but it shows some really good qualities. For one thing, it created some pretty solid characters that had thought-provoking perspectives but still felt like real people. It made fabulous use of its identity as a sci-fi movie. Most of the time, science fiction movies get caught up in visual spectacle and put less effort into using the rules of their world to tell a compelling story, but we get the inverse here. The movie might be visually bleak, but it uses its cerebral nature to hit upon some very human themes about the mind and the heart. The thematic focus of the movie seems to be more on the relationships it presents than any Memento-style investigations of the phenomenon of memory. On the downside, the dialogue was not terribly engaging, despite the numerous excellent one-liners. The pacing was also a problem for me, but I don't think it will be a problem for everyone. Just a couple of final notes. I recommend that you not judge this movie too quickly. It will probably impress you more as you sit on some of the ideas it presents in the following days. Also, for sci-fi fans, be aware that the focus of the movie is on people and human issues rather than more traditional sci-fi plots. The cerebral side of the story mostly serves the purpose of proving that what you don't know can hurt you. Overall Rating: 7.8/10.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of Spotless mind mixes a flavor of Mr. Nobody, Cloud Atlas and Butterfly Effect with the amazing cast and argument. The story of two people who don't know each other, a shy guy (Joel) and a extroverted blue colored girl (Clementine). The concept of the film is amazing, where you see the whole love life between this 2 characters happening in Joel's mind, as he reveals the progress of this relationship through his thoughts. Also it has a kind'off philosophical question as you reflect in weather you'd rather forget about someone you completely or you would like to keep the memories for yourself. In a slightly fast-passed run through life using slow-passed storytelling movie, I'd give it a 8.6/10:More ratings: Actors: 8.5/10 . Photography: 7.5/10 . Argument: 9/10 . Climax:6/10 . Reflection/Affection: 9.5/10 . Montage & Step-outline: 7/10 . Sound: 7.5/10 .\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine in a Spotless Mind\" is an unique movie about love that doesn't start from the beginning but from the end. It's way of telling a love story is not in chronological order but in reverse, the beginning makes you think that Joel and Clementine are getting together only to reveal later that they are their own ex's and realize they still love each other deeply. It hurts to see how Joel still love Clementine through the scene when he begs to keep his most beautiful memory with Clem and knows clearly that he is making a mistake to erase his memory about their love. To see his love story in reverse makes me cry every time I watch. This is the BEST romantic movie ever.\n",

      "Films like Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind come around once in a lifetime, if we're lucky. I watched it when I was too young to fully grasp much, and it flew over my head. In the last few years I had a revisit and was knocked flat. Few stories out there have the power to mine deep within the human psyche and search for the complexities, contradictions and puzzling flaws that lie in the beautiful disasters we call human beings. A contemplative yet fast paced meditation on relationships, love, heartbreak and reconciliation doesn't even begin to paint a picture of what you're in for with this uniquely told and one in a million film. Sagely ragamuffin Michel Gondry, not one for the easy way out, has truly outdone himself, as has screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who is never short on wild ideas with emotional heft that sneaks up and blindsides you. Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) ditches work on a whim one morning, and hops a train out to snowy Montauk. Through fate's mysterious grasp, he meets free spirited Clementine (Kate Winslet), and the two hit it off immediately. He's reserved, cautious and calculated, and she's an impulsive wild card. They couldn't be more different, but somehow they work. Until they don't. Joel is devastated to learn one day of a radical brain alteration technique that effectively removes the memory of an ex from your mind, and Clementine has taken the plunge. Joel is confused and lost, and while the iron is still hot in his beating heart, he decides to undergo the procedure as well. Then the film really turns your world upside down. Whilst the staff of the Institute (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst) go to work on his mind in his sleep, he has a change of heart. With the memories of Clementine radidly disintegrating, he races through the internal landscape of his mind in order to find and save her, hiding her in obscure corners of his data log where she won't be found. It's a genius way to tell the story, taking a delightful turn for the surreal as both of them find themselves catapulted headlong into various moments of his life. On the outside, a tragic subplot unfolds involving Dunst and the the head doctor at the program (Tom Wilkinson). Kirsten and Tom have never been better, treating an often used trope with dignity and gentleness. For all its tricks and psychological whathaveya, the film is first and foremost about love. It isn't interested in showing us any generic or clich√©d depiction of it either, like most of the pandering fluff that gets passed off as romance these days. It strives to show love in all its brutal and painful glory, the fights, the hurt, the time spent alone, the resentment and the willingness to batter your way through all that, against better judgment and logic, if it's worth it. Is love a force of its own, a measurable influence that can transcend a procedure like that? Is it it's own element, or simply always a part of us? Carrey and Winslet (and, to a lesser extent, Wilkinson and Dunst) tenderly search for the answers to these difficult questions in what are the roles of a lifetime for both. Carrey has never been so vulnerable, so open, and despite his brilliant comedic work elsewhere, his performance here is a direct window into the soul, and his best work to date. Although the film is quite labyrinthine and jumps around quite a lot, it never, ever jumps the track or misses a beat. It's always concise, deliberate and crystal clear, if you have the patience and dedication to watch it a few times in order to let all the beautiful images, words and ideas sink in. Movies are first and foremost for entertainment. You give the man your nickel, he fires up the projector and you watch the lone ranger chase down down a speeding locomotive. Every once in a while you get one like this, one that challenges and inspires deep thought, intangible feelings and teaches you something, maybe even about yourself. Every once in a while, you get one that alters your life, and that is what is so important about that little spinning machine that opens up worlds upon a simple flat white canvas where before there was nothing. A masterpiece.\n",

      "One of the rare movies that truly demonstrates the power of one mans' love. Prepared to destroy ever other memory of his life just to be with the girl he loves, is just a tip of the iceberg. Trying to delete her, going through his memories, trying to forget someone, we just realize how that one person really is important to us, and we would do anything to keep them in our life.A movie that shows people that deleting someone from ones' memory is never possible if that person means to much to us.Believing in one another after going through such a procedure is just what true love means and what is hard to get in these days. But every man should be like Joel, to love with all of his heart, like Jonathan from \"Serendipity\" who never believed in destiny.If we do not fight for love, what are we willing to fight for then. Love is the only reason worth fighting for and worth living for. The only reason that makes us who we are.The movie is a one in a kind masterpiece...\n",

      "If Jonah Hill had Jim Carrey's role in this fine movie, you can imagine the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would have fallen over themselves to bestow on him an acting nomination, and it would have been Jonah Hill 3, Jim Carrey 0.Why Mr Carrey did not get an Oscar nomination for his impressive performance in this fine movie is a mystery for the ages. Why oh why? I believe Mr Carrey was denied a nomination for his outstanding performance in The Truman Show. Oh dear. Anyway, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is in incredibly movie that really gets emotional at times, and makes you think about the nature of memories and the nature of love.\n",

      "This is an essential film that, if you haven't seen yet, you should. It stars Jim Carrey who plays Joel, an awkward middle aged man who is shocked to find that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet), acts as if she has never met or seen Joel before. He soon realizes that Clementine had Joel erased from her memory. Joel soon seeks out the people who erased her memory to see if he could have the same operation done, so he could have Clementine erased from his memory. From there we journey into the mind of Joel and memories he had with Clementine. This movie works at so many different things, it works as a comedy, as a drama, and as a science fiction film. Like I mentioned earlier Joel is awkward, but likable. Clementine on the other hand is social and quirky. They're both likable characters, the supporting cast is also likable. There is Patrick (Elijah Wood), Clementine's new boyfriend, also Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Mary (Kristen Dunst), two scientists who work on the operation. Like I mentioned earlier, this is an essential film. Visually, it's creative and unique. When we're in Joel's mind we eventually see erased faces, a bed in the snow on a beach, and a small Jim Carrey. Something to know about this movie is that it is considered an unchronological film, meaning that it isn't in the right order with the story, so it may be confusing while you're watching the movie, but by the end you understand what has happened in the story. I think that was an interesting way to tell the story. This movie also shows that Jim Carrey can do more than just comedy. I like to see actors like Jim Carrey and Robin Williams do serious roles like this. It may not be Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura, but it's definitely an odd classic that anyone can enjoy. Definitely check it out if you haven't already. 9.5 Stars out of 10.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufmann is perhaps the most sophisticated screenwriter (whose films get made) in Hollywood. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a testament to his ability. The writing is multi-layered, the characters flawed but incredibly relatable. Jim Carrey's performance is spectacular, as are the performances of the supporting cast. It is a testament to the writing, acting, and direction, that so much power can be put into the simplest of exchanges. Never before have I felt such an rush of emotion from the word \"okay.\"The film as a whole is a work of art that reaches down into your core. It carries an emotional weight that few films dare to explore, but it succeeds admirably. If I had to gripe about one thing, it would be that the score is occasionally jarring and discordant in places where it clashes with the tone of the scene and feels forced and out of place. This seems to be an intentional artistic choice, but all it did for me was break the suspension of disbelief. That being said, when the score did match the tone of the scene, which was more often than not, the contrast made it all the more powerful.The film is a truly honest look at relationships, exploring exactly why we keep on trying to make them work despite all the pain that they can cause when they end. It follows all the ups and downs, all the joy and all the heartbreak, really mimicking a true relationship in tone and structure. It feels messy and out-of-control, it makes you laugh and cry, the two main characters both do and say things that you cannot abide, and yet you still root for them every step of the way. Relationships are like that; they aren't neat, they aren't all sunshine and rainbows, people say things they don't mean, and their endings leave us confused and distraught. However, as the saying goes, \"it is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.\" Despite all the pain and heartbreak, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind tells us (and shows us) that love truly is worth it in the end.\n",

Enter in the concept that makes 'Eternal Sunshine' something of a un-official science fiction film - the Lacuna corporation, led by Tom Wilkinson's character, can erase just one person out of your memory, all of the experiences that you and the significant other had. So, when Joel (Jim Carrey) goes in to erase his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) after finding out she did just the same, he enters into a mind-warp. He goes through memories they had, happy ones, sad ones, some that are just what makes up what you have emotionally with the one you've loved.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a beautiful movie, and a bit of a darkly-humorous and melancholy look at what heartbreak can do to anyone in the aftermath of a break- up.This film takes you on a journey you connect with while getting a better understanding of the value of memories, love and what it means to be your unadulterated self.Eternal Sunshine is a gorgeous film that I've come to love, deeply.

Breathtaking performances of the two main protagonists illustrates the amazing music. Jim Carrey proves that he can do more than mow in his roles. The part of introverted, humble Joel suits him. Kate Winslet in the role of the love of the hero gives a riveting performance. Clementine spontaneity contrasts with the closeness of Joel. Just the story of two people who must go through some difficulties to discover, what they mean to each other. It is one original love story, where Jim Carrey proves, that he is capable of portraying serious characters.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind revolves around the lives of Clementine Kruczynski, and Joel Barish. The two struggle to keep their relationship afloat, and find themselves fighting more than usual. This results in a break-up which eventually leads Clementine to erase Joel from her memory entirely. Joel sees Clementine at work a few days after the procedure, hes shocked when she doesn't even seem to know who he is. Joel goes and talks to some friends and discovers that she had him cleared from her memory completely. Joel is confused and decides to go to the same place, to get the same procedure as her. Joel brings all his belongings that remind him of Clementine in, to be disposed. Later that day they begin the procedure. The bulk of the movie is a time-lapse of the memories in Joel's brain of Clementine. You see the first time they meet, from the very last memory they had together. Throughout this procedure; not only can you see all of the memories play out, but you also have the insight of Joel's subconscious. It is clear while Joel is re- watching all of his memories play out he regrets making the decision to get the procedure in the first place. He still loves Clementine and while he relives his life with her, he keeps saying 'please, don't let me forget this one'. He doesn't want to forget her, but it is too late. Now both of their memories are erased, and they no long have any recollection of one another. However, that is not where this story ends. This movie is really moving and it's one that everyone can relate to. We have all had a person who we have wanted to forget, but as humans we can't imagine what it's really like to just forget a person completely. This movie demonstrates a desire most humans have felt before; to just forget entirely. You soon find out that maybe there is a reason we can't just forget someone, because no matter how horrible Joel and Clementine's relationship got, he still wanted to hold on to the memories that weren't so bad. The emotions that this movie conveys are very unique because of how bittersweet they are. It's sad because you see how much the two loved each other at the beginning of their romance, compared to wanting to forget about all those memories completely. The sweet part is that they are seemingly reliving those memories, Joel's subconscious and the memory of Clementine try to save and preserve the memories as the procedure is in process. This movie has always resonated with me because if this procedure was real, you can only imagine that it would cause more bad then good, no matter how much mankind has a need to forget all the bad things that happen in their lives, we still have a desire to hold onto what makes us, us. Underlying themes and expressions in the movie also make it a great one. The story of Clementine and Joel is the main story we follow but this movie also takes a look into the lives of others involved. Jim Carey and Kate Winslet do a wonderful job in expressing the feelings that we are meant to feel during the movie. A side note is that it's always nice to see an actor like Jim Carey who usually does funny roles play such a serious role. This makes the movie itself more interesting to watch. This movie is one of the best, and no matter who you are it will be sure to provoke some sort of emotion out of you. Another plus is the ending, which I can't say much about, but unlike most movies this one is pretty satisfying.\n",

Are these the two people whose company we're meant to enjoy? Are we supposed to root for a relationship to bud? Before the audience even asks such questions, we're whisked away to Joel driving in his car sobbing and listening to the somber tones of Beck. We see the awkward beginnings, the bitter end, all within the time frame of five minutes.Through the singular orbits of Joel and Clementine's we're introduced subtly to the film's major sci-fi conceit. In an impetuous rage, Clementine has erased Joel from her memory. Joel is notified via a letter from Lacuna Inc. a company that specializes in such procedures. Feeling the pain of rejection and the anguish of a relationship brought to an unceremonious end, Joel asks to have the procedure of erasure done to him as well. Dr. Mierzwiak (Wilkinson) agrees to help and scans Joel's brain for signs of Clementine.The lion's share of the film is spent inside Joel's head in a bizarro dreamworld where people, places and things are in the process of being erased. Halfway through the erasure, Joel decides he'd rather keep his memories and tries everything in his capacity to keep any retention of Clementine. The creativity involved in keeping semblances of Clementine, combined with the tactile nature of the film's set- pieces provides some of the film's biggest thrills.Director Michel Gondry is often dubbed the mad scientist of cinema. \"I have a duty to make something different,\" said the auteur during a 2008 interview with The Telegraph. Yet unlike his music videos which are beautiful departures into surrealism, Eternal Sunshine is well grounded in the rules it sets for itself. There are some admittedly Freudian explorations but don't expect Spellbound (1945)- esque ruminations on repressed sexuality. If anything, Eternal Sunshine more closely resembles The Blood of a Poet (1932) in both it's emotional resonance and it's funhouse imagination.Eternal Sunshine is a film about relationships; the ones we choose to remember, and the ones we wish we could forget. You can tell Joel and Clementine are a bad match, one being too passive and mousy, the other too brash and prone to histrionics. Yet the one thing these two characters have in common is a petrifying melancholy; a need and desire to be with someone...anyone! Knowing this frees the viewer up to experience their hardships, celebrate in their quiet moments of companionship and even relate with piercing memories of love and lost love of our own.The film's largest triumph is it's ability to cut through all the noise of it's own creation. All the dazzling special-effects, complex characterizations and anxious spells of emotional climax fade into flashes of beautiful silence. These precious moments, such as the iconic hand-holding scene along a frozen lake provide the audience with thoughts of acute clarity. We exist, we fall in love. We fall out of love, we make mistakes and sometimes due to stubbornness or forgetfulness, we repeat those same mistakes. Usually though, if you take a few moments of quiet reflection you may just learn something.\n",

      "So its a clever film. With a unique story line. My problem was that I assumed there would be a happy ending to the film pretty much the whole way through (oh they'll find their way back to each other and live happily ever after despite everything!) so a lot of the genuinely sad material in the movie was lost on me (and yes I accept responsibility for that. But I think they want to have this effect based on how they structured the film). In essence this movie is about two people who realize their relationship is doomed and go through with it anyway until the inevitable end because they are compelled to. And that's the most beautiful part of this film. Nothing can erase their innate attraction to each other. Love is strong enough to defy loss of memory but not strong enough to defy fate (I think. Assuming I got the end correct...)Now, the problem I have with it is that its unrealistic. They are so completely different in every way on every level, this kind of relationship would never happen in real life. And don't lecture me about \"opposites attract\". They aren't just opposites, they are whole levels of existence different from each other. Because the relationship seemed so unlikely it was hard for me to accept it as the pillar of the story. And I was kind of dubious the whole time they were together. Like I was watching some day dream he was having about a girl he knew he could never get with.And then when memories start becoming a feature of the film it got terribly confusing for me. What was real. What was true. what was going on. I needed to really get to the very end to get all the pieces and then I had to piece it back together and in the course of doing that I missed a lot of the emotional significance of many of the scenes. This one would really benefit from an immediate rewatch but I honestly have no desire to go through it again (felt exactly the same way about Memento for similar reasons).In the end Im still not sure of the central message of the film. Is it in fact that love is deeper than memory or is it more a statement about the inevitable corruption of trying to use artificial means to free ourselves of emotional discomfort? Perhaps the latter was just a plot device to emphasize the former?Perhaps Shakespeare sums up this movie best: tis better to have loved and lost then to never have loved at all...\n",

      "This is one of these films that you can label into genres of course, everything bears properties that allow that thing to be put into a specific box, but here what we've got is a sci-fi/drama/mystery philosophical comedy/romance that is authentic enough that it really doesn't fit completely anywhere but in a category of its own. Jim Carrey shows more of his seemingly endless range, while Winslet does a solid job, as well as the seconds, which all play an important role in the film (as opposed to just filling in).This piece does a great job providing a very strong development of its main premise, all the while nourishing/complexifying it with accessory subplots relevant to the film's story, concept and feel. Structurally and in terms of cinematography, the movie excels. And poses a philosophical question of a very unusual angle throughout its playing time, and the ending brings a fantastic conclusion to the story, while never separating from the spirit of the film. There's that feeling of unreal infinity, like an endless mirror effect, a very real and poetic nostalgia, and at the center of it, a beautiful love story with a very unique flavor. Coherent, excellently conceived and executed, 'unique' film that deserves to be seen and that can touch movie-enthusiasts of all horizons.\n",

      "Can we really erase our memories?Can we really just forget the past and say \"Ok, let's move on...\"Well, to be honest here, this movie really put me in a tight spot. We are coming from the dark. We are heading to the dark. The middle bright space it is infamously known as life. And \"infamously\", cause we usually spend the whole of it searching for its meaning. For the reason to stay alive and not just suicide to find redemption.So, what makes us? Love.And YES, we can find it. Even in the darkest periods of our existence love is always there, awaiting to be discovered, even though our fear for living stops us.I have to say this movie found it. Throughout the love story of Joel and Clementine, and with a pinch of sci-fi, this film managed to discover the love that is well hidden into ourselves and barely manages to come in the surface to show us the real meaning of life. A journey into the dream worlds of our minds in order to fight our ego and our crave for revenge on the ones that hurt us.Jim Carrey, aka Joel, managed to exceed the expectations and this time he definitely showed he can be more of just a comedian. And what a perfect way to do it, having Kate Winslet on his side, who actually fitted really well on the role of Clementine, as a mad girl lost in herself but with an unstoppable desire to live life on the edges. And all that would be impossible without Michael Gondry who managed to put the pure love and forgiveness together in a movie about the non-stop seek of real love and soul redemption.A must-see masterpiece of our generation that no one should miss.\n",

      "So one of the reasons I try my hardest to ignore IMDb reviews is because they off times are written by people who can't see the bigger picture. If you give a damn about your cinema and how things are crafted then Eternal Sunshine is one of the best films for you.Not only is the directing from Michel Gondry pretty solidified as rather fantastic, the writing from Charlie Kaufman is nothing short of perfection. He is currently my favourite screenwriter and closely turning into my favourite director (if his next film is above an 8/10 for me).One of the things that stands out to me as perfect is not necessarily the dialogue (which is pretty great on its own) but the use of story telling. Now this isn't like Memento in which the the story telling was so subtle and unique in its structure as such, but more through the overall pacing. By this I mean there is extremely minimal exposition to guide you along the way, and where there is some, it's only there for a few seconds at that and I never feel cheated because it genuinely feels like the characters are talking to each other and not the audience. From this we are able to absorb all the information we need without being treated like we're 5 years old. Every second that flies a voice in my head just says \"Oh, that's because this is happening\".The Pacing is great, the acting is stellar; most noticeably from the God that is Jim Carey, the characters are well defined and interesting and it is all crafted so wonderfully. Everything that Charlie Kaufman has done, weather it be written or directed, is absolutely breathtaking (everything he has had some involvement with I consider to be a 10/10 if you check my ratings list) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is my favourite of his.I'm not saying you're an idiot if you don't like this film, I'm saying you're an idiot if you can't at least see some of the genius put into this film (again, I'm only emphasising my love for this film, you are not an idiot, don't worry). If you like your cinema smart, funny, sweet, fast paced and just genuinely perfect, then this film is for you. So grab your pop-corn and your coke... and your cola (ayy) and get hyped because this film is genuinely one of the best films that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.\n",

      "After i watched the first 20 minutes, i would have never imagined that the movie would evolve like this. At first, i thought my DVD player had skipped chapters because it doesn't make sense anymore. That's when i discovered it was labeled science-fiction and so this kind of erasing memory is indeed the right stuff of my favorite writer PKD ! It's all the more close to his work that it features a really nobody, simple couple that we don't see very often in American productions ! For this kind of intimate sci-fi romance, the french touch of the director is really fit and he is really great at filming past collapsing: There's great, poetic visuals and haunting visions of this erasing and this sort of man vs machine keeps awake. It's true that it's maybe one of the best job for Carrey because for one time, he doesn't have fun! Kate is always wonderful, playing a straight, direct girl who is full of energy! However i still regret that the beautiful and moving romance of the start hasn't go on like in the real world because for one time i would have preferred to cry over a romance than to have been thrown into a science fiction story !\n",

      "This movie introduced me to the creative and genius minds of Charlie Kaufman and Michael Gondry. I'm not one who usually enjoys watching movies several times but this movie is an exception - the more you watch it, the more you will fall in love with it. The main characters, Joel & Celementine, depict the ideal \"opposites attract\" relationship which is believable and genuine. Clementine is one of my all-time favourite characters from a film. The supporting characters also leave a lasting impression on the viewer and are well cast. The originality of the story-line, the special effects, the superb acting and the captivating soundtrack make this a fascinating watch.It's a simple idea of love and heartbreak turned into a surreal and mesmerising journey.\n",

      "I wish I had been able to watch this movie without expectations. I was aware that it was highly rated and many people praised it as a surreal romance that would be dramatic, but ultimately heartwarming.In contrast, I can appreciate this movie the most if I approach it as a psychological drama, which isn't concerned with warm, fuzzy feelings. Mostly because I did not share or experience the warm or romantic tone that some reviewers seem to get from this film. To me, the majority of the movie, as well as the characters' personalities, seemed rather uncomfortable, tense and borderline disturbing at times. (Spoilers ahead)1) First of all, I am obviously well aware of the typical shy, nice guy meets quirky, adventurous girl/opposites attract-story, where the characters are both flawed and troubled to some(!) degree, but together they'll complete each other. However, the main characters in this movie do not seem to fit those typical roles. Each of them seems a few degrees too far off the edge psychologically. Joel is not just shy and kind, he displays a significant level of neurosis and he knows it. Clementine is not just lovably quirky, but rather emotionally unbalanced, which she admits. That, actually, makes both of these characters actually very realistic. But it is exactly this realistic aspect which undermines any potential romantic warmth for the most part. Watching their interactions unfold, I felt constantly reminded of the fact that each of them was struggling and clearly unable to form healthy relationships at this point. Any psychologist would tell them that they have to sort themselves out first. This is emphasized by the fact that we know(!) that their first relationship has failed and we also learn that it has failed for exactly the kind of reasons that you would expect: Opposites attract at first, because people who are not at ease with themselves seek others to complete them...which eventually fails when the differences become too noticeable. Again, a very realistic scenario...but not a very romantic one. 2) The whole memory-erasing plot doesn't exactly create a comfortable atmosphere either, especially since the whole business is portrayed as somewhat dubious throughout. The concept itself is portrayed as morally controversial since it shows over and over again that erasing one's mind doesn't really solve problems, all the physicians involved seem like they have personal issues themselves, they act irresponsibly on the job and even clearly abuse their power over their patients in a creepy fashion. So when I watched the middle part of the movie, I was hardly thinking about Joel and Clem's romance anymore. Instead, I just felt generally anxious about whether or not the doctors would simply ruin Joel's mind. And when Joel began to almost lose it, while struggling to stop the process and maybe even intervene in Patrick's games with Clem, I was certainly getting more of a psychological thriller-vibe than a romantic vibe. 3) It also didn't help that it wasn't really clear to me where the plot was going during the main act. Joel seems to lose his mind and he seems to struggle against the erasing procedure, but why exactly and to what end? Is he struggling because he is in danger, since the doctors are doing a bad job? Is he struggling to save Clem from Patrick? Is it because of his feelings for Clem? Problem is, we have already seen how his relationship with Clem will turn out and his internal interactions with her do not feel significant enough to justify any \"I just realized I still love her!\" realizations. So the movie just moves around for a while, we see some childhood memories, some flashbacks, but in the end his mind is erased...and then they meet again & discover the back story & decide that they still want to proceed...which is not as ridiculous as some reviewers have suggested. It seems understandable that they can only make decisions based on how they feel in that moment and since they are newly in love (again), it doesn't really affect their decision to know how it will turn out. They might even decide consciously that they would like to experience that chapter of their lives again, because it is lovely while it lasts. After all, the value of a relationship is not necessarily dependent on it lasting forever. However, all this makes it difficult for me to experience this as a romantic feel-good story about two troubled characters finding love, like some people seem to perceive this movie. Instead, I witnessed a movie full of tense, significantly (not lovably) troubled characters, emotionally unhealthy relationships, psychologically disturbing mind- meddling...and at the end two characters decide to relive a romance which we know will probably be over in a few months (again), because they still haven't really changed who they are. So while the tension of the movie eases towards the end, it still ends in a soothing melancholy at best. Not really a warm, fuzzy romantic ending, if that is what the viewer might expect. So, after adjusting my expectations, I come to the conclusion that this is certainly a very original movie in terms of concepts and structure, which might be best experienced as a psychological drama, at the end of which the world has changed very little, without any profound insights or personal developments. Life will literally repeat itself for now. A sobering feeling that leaves a strange emptiness and uncertainty rather than any uplifting romantic notions.\n",

      "So this is one of those stories that makes you think for a long time after you see it. It makes you think about love. It makes you think about the value of pain. It makes you think about choices, and it makes you think about possibilities. And of course, it leaves you with a big \"what if.\" Don't try too hard to follow the time-line because it isn't linear, and if that sort of thing frustrates you, maybe you won't like this film. It will become clearer as the film progresses, I promise. And I love the use of vibrant colors as anchors in time. The acting is fantastic. The direction is spot-on. It could be called a chick-flick, but that isn't a bad thing for guys; you will enjoy the concept, think of \"Being John Malkovich.\" It's not as absurd, but it is unreal. And maybe you will feel all the feels right along with our hero. I honestly recommend watching it. However, don't watch this with a significant other unless you are prepared to talk about it for hours! There will be a looming question that he or she will want answered.\n",

      "Insanely original and intelligent movie.A man, Joel (played by Jim Carrey), discovers that his ex- girlfriend, Clementine (played by Kate Winslet), recently had all memories of him erased from her memory. He decides to do the same. However, halfway through the procedure, he has second thoughts. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game as he tries to hide memories of her within his brain, to prevent the erasers getting to them.Directed by Michel Gondry and co-written by Gondry and Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), this movie has to be one of the most intelligent ever made. Not only clever, but the plot is watertight. Many writers and directors try to be too clever and simply end up with a hole-ridden script as a result. Not so in this case.There's also a great emotional aspect and profundity to this movie. The movie examines what memories mean to us as humans and the benefits and disadvantages of them, and comes up with some interesting conclusions. The relationship between Joel and Clementine is quite moving too.Superb performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in the lead roles. Good support from Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst.An absolute must-see.\n",

      "As much as I have always enjoyed and appreciate this movie, the ending always leaves me a little blue. This a powerful movie with a lot of truthful insight to love and relationships, but the conclusion seems to suggest- to me, anyway- that we all get trapped in cycles, and that most relationships well fall apart eventually. That being said, the movie is wide open to interpretation, so surely other viewers might find it more uplifting than me. It's worth seeing for Jim Carrey alone, who is far more sincere in this role than most of his starring vehicles. He's capable of great dramatic moments, and it's rare to see him playing a part that doesn't go over the top. Kate Winslet is equally impressive, but her character can get a little frustrating at times. All in all this is a very strong film, very well made- but don't expect a perfectly happy ending.\n",

      "Emotions are the main reason why I fell in love with cinema. Art in general has the power to affect us on an emotional level but there's something about the way film does it that I find captivating. The reason I watch films is because I want to get absorbed in a story and feel for the characters.Unfortunately, I spend a lot more time thinking and reading about films (especially films I haven't seen yet) than I do watching them (I am very picky about whether or not it is the right time to watch a film). As a result, I have the tendency to idolise films I haven't seen yet and conjure this fantasy that they will be a mind-blowing ten out of ten movie that I will cherish forever. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' has become one of these films. Highly regarded as one of the best films of the 21st century, 'Eternal Sunshine' is known for being an incredibly intelligent and emotional film that examines a relationship that turned sour once that initial spark had faded. This film is definitely intelligent. It has a very interesting premise that it presents through unique and eye-catching visuals. This, as well as the well-written characters and the themes of love and nostalgia, make the film very engaging. Unfortunately, the film did not have the emotional punch that I had hyped myself up for. This is most likely due to the high expectations I had placed on it. As I watched the film, I spent a lot of time waiting for it to hit me emotionally, which may have, ironically, distracted me from getting absorbed into the film and getting that punch. However, the film still has a lot to offer. Even after a week since I saw the film, I am still thinking about it. In particular, I keep thinking about some of the details that writer Charlie Kaufman put in this world to make it more believable. Also, the performances are great. Pretty much everyone did a good job bringing these characters to life. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, in particular, each give one of the best performances of their careers. The film depends on them as much as it does on director Michel Gondry's visuals. Gondry's surreal portrayal of Joel's mind as his memories of Clementine are being erased not only gives the film a unique feel, but also shows us how much Joel connected with Clementine during their relationship. These aspects are topped off with Jon Brion's score. Although I didn't really take notice of the music as I was watching the film, some of the tracks that I decided to revisit feel like they helped establish Gondry and Kaufman's world and characters. \"Drive In\" has been stuck in my head for the last few days, and I love the part of \"Theme\" that appears to be music being played in reverse.Upon reflection, 'Eternal Sunshine' seems like it might be my Clementine. I expected my time with it to be one of the greatest experiences of my life but these expectations did nothing but damage the experience. Maybe this is some intentional meta genius on Kaufman's part. I wouldn't put it past him. Granted, it is also possible that the lack of emotional punch could be because a good portion of the film is spent with the characters in Joel's apartment during the memory erasure process. This may have stopped me from getting emotionally absorbed into the Joel and Clementine's relationship, which is the heart of the film. It could also be that the surreal twists and turns need some time and a second viewing to get fully accustomed to. But still, this is very well made and thought out film that had me engaged and thinking. Even if the film never lives up to my initial expectations, I feel that this film is still good enough to warrant to second viewing sometime in the future.http://boxd.it/7iU4x\n",

      "\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned.\" -Alexander PopeThis is a movie I can watch over and over again and never get tired of. It is an original sci-fi love story. The possibility to forget and erase all memories about your past is looked at. So, the movie starts off with Clementine and Joel who were in a rocky relationship since a long time. Clementine, being impulsive, got Joel erased from her memory so when Joel met her, she no longer recognized him to Joel's surprise. Joel looked into the matter and found out that he was erased from Clementine's mind. Angry, he decides to do the same. However, while Joel is in the process of erasing his past, he relives the moments and memories that he and Clementine have shared. He realizes that no matter what, he does not want to forget about his relationship with Clementine. He wants to get out of the procedure but there is no going back.Now this movie portrays two dysfunctional people in a relationship which appears to be unhealthy since they are constantly fighting. Familiar? Yes, surely one can relate to their relationship fights and issues. We get an insight of what could have happened if painful memories could be forgotten and erased forever. I came to the conclusion that, even if this was possible, feelings would eventually resurface. Like in the movie, both characters felt there was something between them even after forgetting about each other forever. They were like two strangers meeting for the first time but having the \"d√©j√†- vu\" impression. Strangers yet feeling so comfortable and close to each other. Both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey did an amazing job. They were so into their respective characters that the movie came out brilliant. Excellent directing as well! It is a movie that will leave you awestruck! Heart-warming, packed with emotions with a little touch of fantasy and yet ending on an unexpected but realistic note. Extraordinary movie!

      "If I were to make a list of best film names, this would be near the top. It is from a section of a poem by Alexander Pope that goes like this: \"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!The world forgetting, by the world forgot.Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd\" The whole poem is long and good but not important to this review. What I love is how effortlessly they dropped the title. A long and cumbersome title like this would normally drag the audience out of the film if someone said it. But this is no ordinary film. This is often ranking as one of the top movies of the 00's. And it dispenses the title fluidly. In fact, it's more than that; the title drop is one of the best moments of a movie with a lot of them, How many times can you say that about a film? Sometimes I've come out of a mediocre film and snarked that the title drop's the best part. When I finished watching this film, I honestly and sincerely thought that the title drop is one of the best parts. And that is saying something. There are a lot of great parts.The plot is fairly complex, but the premise is simple enough: after Clementine (A delightful Kate Winslet) has her relationship with Joel (Jim Carrey in the best performance he has ever given or ever will give) erased, Joel seeks to have the same thing done to himself. But after he realizes that some of the memories are worthy keeping, he fights to save them. Of course, if it was that simple, the film may have made more money (it didn't flop, but it only made it to 70 million worldwide and that was only one the starpower of Mr. Carrey. I may not love him as an actor or a person for the most part, but I do appreciate that he basically allowed this film to get made) or pleased more people back in its day (it got a 2.4x multiplier- frankly terrible for this sort of film- as well as a B Cinemascore, both of which make me more depressed for the people of this world).This is a dense and quite thematic film. If you want dull laughs, check out something else. Wikipedia calls it a romantic science-fiction comedy-drama, which basically tells you all you need to know about its level of complexity. Kaufman is the scriptwriter and it shows. If you like his other films, you will like this one. But if you don't, try it out anyways.I never have loved Kaufman movies. I respect them to the moon and back; he is one of the best screenwriters in the world. I would give Being John Malokovich and the like high marks from an artistic viewpoint. But I've never really liked them on a personal level, and as film to me is a deeply emotional medium, I have never been able to support any of his films. Except this one. I suppose it's because, at its core, this film is a true love story.I don't mean that it is absolutely a love story, though it is. I mean that it is a love story that goes beyond the fairy tale/ fourteen year-old girl/ Taylor Swift version of love. It's complex, it's multifaceted, it's intense, it's fading, it's important, it's destructive. I don't like a lot of Kaufman flicks because they don't fulfill me; I want to like them because they're artfully written, but they just seem dark without having a core; the equivalent of a grand castle with nobody home, if you will.I love this film because it uses those artistic stylings and philosophical thoughts to support a romantic, emotional, humanist core. It does not shoot you straight up into intellectual outerspace. It arcs you across it and you come down on the other side knowing that you are at least a bit more wise and cultured and emotionally intelligent than you were before. It actually takes its audience somewhere forward, somewhere worth being. All great films, this one including, do that while staying on their own terms. This is the sort of film that I could write a book about, at least if I watched the film constantly to keep it fresh in my mind. There is so much going on here, but not the sake of posturing. I love that in a film. The music is stunning. A good deal (though not enough) main pieces fit the themes of their film. The main piece of this movie actually enhances its themes. It is confused, melancholy, hopeful, romantic, wonky, cynical, and at the day's end, stunning, just like this film. The other pieces and songs are no less appropriate, including Beck's Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometimes, which has a spot on my playlist on any rainy day.I never want to forget watching this movie.\n",

It's has so complicated screenplay that one can be juggling deep down in his mind through-out. But, surely it's a tendering experience to watch this film every time. It teaches you lots of things when watched with a keen eye. Love is complicated as we all know, nobody is perfect, we just mutually need to build the art of balancing what's good & what's bad in it, to make it work as wonder, because Everybody's gotta learn sometime. It deserves repeated viewing who understand this film's outcomes completely. Jim Carrey is surprising, so is Kate Winslet charm of acting.

Synechdoche, New York), Michael Gondry, and Pierre Bismuth (Where is Rocky II, The 77th Annual Academy Awards, I've been Twelve Forever). It stars Jim Carrey (The Truman Show, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Dumb and Dumber) and Kate Winslet (Titanic, Revolutionary Road, Finding Neverland).Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is about Joel (Jim Carrey) who has recently broken up with his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) and he finds out that she had all of her memories of him erased, Joel decides to do the same. But in the middle of the erasing process, he realizes he wants to keep those memories after all.With all Charlie Kaufman movies, the writing will always be the highlight. He and others write an incredibly original script that is unlike no other and you will never see again. It is filled with great characters including the star-studded supporting cast who all do terrific as well. He deals with many sub-themes of love and loss and he will sure to leave you in tears.With such an interesting but odd premise, you need someone who could bring this premise to life. Gondry does an incredible job of using odd camera work and lighting to put us in the mind of Joel as his memories are being erased. He does a great job with everything to really make Kaufman's script a reality.My only complaint with this movie is it is kind of confusing, but a second viewing helps you to take it all in. This is a very original funny and sad movie I would recommend to everyone.\n"

      "Director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman's most notable feature film. A story about two estranged lovers, who both decide to undergo a treatment that makes them completely forget one another. But during the treatment one of them, while reliving all the good times they had, decides that he doesn't want to forget.The film is also known for being one of Jim Carrey's finest roles, and probably also the one where he uses his comedic talents the least, which doesn't hinder the movie in any way. The film certainly has its humorous moments, but Carrey plays his role very seriously, as a man torn down to his foundations, suffering from betrayal, loss and melancholy. The bizarre tone of the film means that achieving any serious drama is that much more difficult, but Carrey pulls it off beautifully.Kate Winslet does a great job as the main female lead as well, and the film features some really big names, including Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst, in the side roles. All of them give very grounded, serious performances, keeping with the down to earth tone of the film.Saying anything more would very likely ruin the whole film. It is a unique story about love, the importance of memories and pulling yourself through even the hardest of times. Trust me when I say that it's worth a watch.\n",

      "The memory is erased, but love exist. This is a main subject of this movie. To begin with I confused this story. What director say to us? Because I don't understand the first some cut of this movie. But as times go, Consequently I know the meaning at the end of the movie time. Joel hope to erase the memory with Clementine, But he couldn't. And eventually they love again. I remembered Nietzsche's famous saying, \"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders\". I surprised Jim carrey and Kate Winslet's acting. I first saw the main actor this movie. Honestly I don't believed this acting because Jim Carrey was famous for comedy acting and I never think about Kate Winslet like this character. But two actors gratefully acted their role. And I well concentrated on this movie This movie was very interesting and moved my mind. And I also recommend this movie and I will see this movie twice in my life.\n",

      "My life would be incomplete, if I don't write few words on this films. The only reason this film isn't getting a 9/10 stars is because the sci-fi part isn't anything genius. But let push that aside for now. Because, when I was watching this film I barely concentrated on the science part.I've always liked Jim Carrie and Kate Winslet. But this is the first movie that made me respect these two. Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo was good enough. I've never figured out whether I hated Kristen Dunst's character or it was just her.From the technical point of view: the special effects, smart. Film editing, award worthy. Soundtrack, okay. Sound mixing, good. Screenplay, one of the best in the genre. I want to state this as clearly as possible, I ROOTED FOR THE FICTIONAL COUPLE IN \"ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND\". And I'm not ashamed of it.Final verdict: 8.4/10. It's a \"Nice\" movie for everyone. But a masterpiece for multidimensional people.\n",

      "This film is one of a kind. It is fantastic in every way. Kate Winslet plays a new character for her and does it in the best way. Jim Carey is a serious, love struck man. He plays a serious role. He is out of his comedic element and I'm not complaining. As a film editor, this film's style gives me chills. The editing is upon the best I have ever seen.The story line is something that I have never seen anything come close to. It's a mysterious, thrilling love story that has you hooked from beginning to end. An A+ film for all to see. If you haven't watched it already, do yourself a favor.\n",

      "For a person who is not a big fan of Romances i must say that movie just grab me.The writers did a really good job Kate Winslet was awesome very good performance she hit me in the ground with that role a cute girl a little bit wild and crazy very impulsive and emotional and Kate Winslet totally nailed.But im little confused about Jim Carrey im not sure why i didn't like it in that movie was it because of the character that he play maybe because he was a little unsocial and sad and i just can't imagine Jim Carrey in role like this i don't know but i didn't like it .And that's probably one of the few things in the movie that i didn't like everything other was good the story was very touching the movie show us that side of love that is probably purest and strongest.When two persons chose to continue their lives together no matter what.Bought of the characters in the movie saw every bad habit every pain every embarrassing moments every bad side in other person but they chose ignore that and to stay with the things that make them SMILE.The things that make them happy and the moments when they tease each other when they open them selfs in front of the other person and he accept them .They chose not to thrown away with easy hand this deep and important feelings I think that's beautiful.The movie really touch you and drawn you in lot of emotions.Deserve Watching.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's mystifying and sometimes downright confusing premise, due to the fact that it transcends reality and largely exists in the mind of a man, who is actively pursuing his unconscious to preserve dreams and memories, is levied by how incredibly honest its emotions and romantic notions can get at times. Even in its darkest, saddest moments, this is a thoroughly beautiful film, emotionally potent all around, exacting every emotion your system can handle almost with complete impunity to your senses. It's an uncommon film that, even when it's perplexing, still makes you grateful you're not watching a basic, linear romance drama.The film opens with Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), a disconnected and unhappy soul, who impulsively ditches work one day and meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on a train. Clementine is the exact opposite of Joel, free-spirited and frequently spacey, unfazed by a great deal of contrivances many get hung up on in their lives. We see their relationship span the course of two years before it ends in a fairly ugly fight, with Joel utterly baffled that one day, when he goes to meet and make up with Clementine, she has no recollection of who he is. Clementine had hired the services employed by a company called Lacuna, Inc., a corporation that specialized in erasing the memories of someone or something by completely white-washing the brain and making the subject forget any and everything related to said person or event.When Joel discovers this, he is loaded with questions that bear confidential answers; Clementine doesn't remember him and that's killing him, for he has no idea as to what her motivations or present feelings were. He has no other ideas besides to effectively wipe his own memory, reaching out to neurologist Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to take advantage of his services. The memory-erasing crew consists of Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst), all of whom are taking care of Joel during his operation and bearing their own individual secrets attached to the project that come to light during the operation. It isn't until halfway through the operation, as Joel is having more-or-less an out of body experience, seeing Clementine disappear from his memories as he relives every moment he ever spent with her, that he realizes he doesn't want to go through with the operation. Within every memory, Joel tries as hard as he can to preserve Clementine's presence, even if that means taking him to some unknown part of his unconscious or into a memory where she was never personally present.Writer Charlie Kaufman creates a story so grounded in fantasy, yet simultaneously so devoted to showing it in a realistic manner, that the balancing act the film manages to pull off is quite remarkable to say the least. If minds could be erased and people, events, or traumatic experiences could be wiped away from our collective conscious and unconscious, then the methods would likely look a lot like how they're portrayed in Eternal Sunshine. Consider the visual scheme employed by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, a frequent collaborator of not only director Michael Gondry but Spike Lee, which emphasizes dreamlike beauty and subtle color schemes. Look at the way Clementine's hair changes color with her mood; when she's frightened and vulnerable, her hair is blue, and when she is content and so happy she could die, her hair is a light, relaxing shade of lime green. On top of that, the visual scheme employed in the sequences involving the past memories both Joel and Clementine experienced are almost soothing in the way they are captured and lit, evoking a rare sense of romanticized innocence.Eternal Sunshine's biggest issue, however, is its organization, which never allows us to get too comfortable or too immersed into any particular situation. I would've loved an entire film set inside the mind of Joel as it's being wiped free of anything related to Clementine, but Kaufman's distractions, in the form of the memory-erasers and their stories, provide for an annoying disruption to the intimacy and emotional resonance that takes so long to build from Joel and Clementine. By the time the film has that and has us totally wrapped up in these characters, it jumps back and forth between those actively erasing Joel's memory and the mind being erased, burdening an already difficult film to follow with more excess.Nonetheless, there's a beauty in the natural flow of emotions, and the simultaneous romance and sadness elements Kaufman employs here. It's difficult to make one feel touched and consumed by the love of a film's characters, yet sad and glum about the inevitable results of their actions and the happenings on screen, but Kaufman remarkably does it. The emotional roller-coaster Eternal Sunshine takes you on, never allowing you to cling to one emotion for too long, is remarkable from a screen writing standpoint, and a true work of beauty that needs to be cherished. Throw in strong central performances, particularly from Carrey, who handles the role of melancholy and lovestruck well, intertwining them with a sense of rare symmetry, and you have a pleasantly complex film that caters to the spirit and the soul.Starring: Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson, and David Cross. Directed by: Michael Gondry.\n",

      "The first time I saw this film there I understood nothing and I did not like it probably because I was not very big, it seemed confusing and meaningless. After many years, I decided to try again, trying to understand why if this film had an average votes so high I had to consider it as one of the most ugly that I had seen. To my surprise (and a bit of hope) in fact the situation has changed. A story different from usual that can be seen and reviewed several times without problems. A love story that makes you realize how strong can be a bond even if things are not going well and that the only solution is still to be together and overcome them together. The good sides of the film, however, end here: good story, good acting, however, do not know why but the film is still not yet fully convinced me, too confusing in places where you do not understand well how are you running it all in his head and why happen certain types of things. Surely in the end it all makes sense to help you understand also the beginning then it all connects perfectly but I still think it could be done in another way. However confirm the good impressions especially compared to the first time and I recommend everyone to watch it at least once.\n",
      "1052\n",
      "I've seen this film a few times over the years but it resonated deeply with me this time round. Although beautifully shot and intriguingly dreamlike to watch (more so on subsequent viewings) The story can feel achingly depressing if you hold a conventional view of love and relationships. The beauty I find in this film is that concept that love is an uncontrollable force of it own. It can't be removed by canceling out memories, or artificially created by constructing experiences. Clementine (Winslet) and Joel (Carey), when meeting for the second time, cannot stop the relationship from developing even though they've had a clear and depressing foreshadowing of whats to come. Mary (Kirsten Dunst) doesn't stop being in love with her married boss after wiping all memories of the relationship, and in contrast Patrick (Eilijh Wood) can't make Clem fall in love with him by recreating experiences from her relationship with Joel. In short; love hurts and there's nothing that we can do about it, thats either depressing or liberating depending on your frame of mind.\n",
      "1053\n",
      "This, right here, has to be one of my Top 3. What an astoundingly deep and perceptively beautiful film; I could re-watch it, again and again. The dialogue, the script, the \"twist\", the memories, and the characters - everything about this film is endearing and something to be cherished.I felt complete after finishing this; there was nothing I could say I want to changed in order for it to be better - because it's sublime.I thought it would be over-rated and over-stated but it crossed even my wildest expectations.The best bit, the song at the end is a favorite and I'd listened to it before I even knew it was from this film's soundtrack. As haunting and deep as the movie itself, the song captures its essence perfectly.\n",

      "There are no regular time. I can't understand what is happen in each scene in this film. Firstly, I want to watch film that Jim Carrey appeared, especially, I like his comedy movie, and finally I found this film. I think Jim Cally is \"comedian actor\", but it is not true. In this story, it is maybe SF film. We maybe can't expect what is happen to hero and heroin. This film is vaguely impractical but we maybe experience in the future. I think if somebody watch this film only one time, h/she think it is very interesting film. However, if somebody watch this film many time, h/she find new important point of this film and they more like this film.\n",

      "When I saw this film for the first time it was like a hit of an iceberg. Something entirely new.Never seen before genre, spreading from scene to scene like a wildfire of odd imagination. Jim Carrey at his best. I felt like every single frame wasn't even planned, it was like life; how it's supposed to be, coming all together like puzzle. IT just fit. It does. I've seen it more than 50 times, and I bet I'll see it twice as many times yet. It will come back to me. Like colors came back to WInslet's head. For those who're reading reviews in order to decide whether or not see this film, sit tight, and better get some popcorn. You're in for a treat.\n",

      "This is one of my favorite movies. I've seen it about 5 times!Eevry time I watch this, I always think about \"the fate\".He wants to delete about memories of his girlfriend once, but he tries to keep them, the figure is really painful.Why do they love each other again even if they lose their memories? I think it is the fate.I want everybody who has lover to see this movie.It is really important to have lover, and we should appreciate that.Time backs and forth so we should keep eyes on the movie.Kate Winslet and Jim Carry are the right post. I can get affinity with them.\n",

      "Combining very solid acting performances with an extremely clever and beautifully executed storyline, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind draws upon very imaginative writing and offers its audience a mind-boggling emotional journey through the mind and memories of a hopeless romantic, skillfully portrayed by Jim Carrey. Although the film does come across as slightly confusing in its early stages, the story does eventually come together rather seamlessly, as all the elements are expertly structured together to create a magnificent final product. The entire cast definitely deserves praise, but the film's outstanding feature is undoubtedly the brilliant editing and overall design, which successfully creates a very memorable viewing experience, one that is intriguing and touching all at the same time. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind can therefore be described as being both intellectually provocative and emotionally satisfying, a combination of qualities that few films can truly relate to.\n",
      "1058\n",
      "The idea of this movie is very unique, but that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, I loved the movie. It's not one I would re-watch thirty times, but it's thoughtful, and engaging, and quiet in an utterly perfect, achy way. It will leave you bright-eyed and pensive, about love and its meaning, about people and their silly, human ways. About what it means to break up and let go, about whether letting go is really what you should be doing, or whether holding on is really the thing you should be doing. About being alone and being with someone, and about how sometimes love falls in places it shouldn't, and how that hurts, and how you deal (or don't).Just a lovely movie. Completely, wholly lovely.\n",

      "Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's union was pretty odd for me. Thinking the goofy odd Ace Ventura meeting the romantic and emotional hearted Rose from Titanic to be in the same movie. Honestly throughout the movie, it was pretty depressing for me. The fact that the universe provides the opportunity for someone to delete certain memory from you is pretty scary. On the other hand the director Michel Gondry put an interesting setting of the movie. I noticed many times the background music is louder than the the actor's voice. At first it bothers me, but then i see the point. It was all about creating an important and key scenes using mostly the music. The second half of the movie is a little twisty , meaning that there is so much going on for a simple purpose, for example like having 3 places can fall in one scene. The ending was pretty emotional for me, but it was a well-constructed story. I'd give a 7 because not everybody can follow or would enjoy the movie as much, but on the other hand the movie has its own character, not by the plot, but by the cinematography. I'm sure it takes a major thinking process to make this kind of movie. Jim Carrey surprisingly maintained his character pretty well without being somewhat funny. Eternal Sunshine and the Spotless Mind is a well done. Full of art and thought although it's not really for everybody.\n",

      "It's one of the great movies dealing with toying with one's psyche.Erasing someone from your memory to get rid of the suffering and all the associated memories. This is like time traveling into the relatively distant future. Does this not usually happen with us? The mind cleanses itself of bad things, it minimizes them in a corner where you really need to look to remember, a corner you can't find by accident. But perhaps a corner that influences present actions and decisions without realizing.So this film makes me wonder: is this an exercise to imagine what would happen maybe 10 years from a break up? What if you meet again, what if you could hear yourself bashing that person years ago for the reasons of your breakup ‚Äì would you feel the same, would you feel ashamed? Would you go for it again, knowing with some degree of certainty what the outcome will be, just to experience those great moments again? You know it will end up in misery, but maybe it's a hell of a ride which makes it all worthwhile.As the viewer you're allowed to see this as a valid option, a bad idea, an unethical procedure or anything else in between. Usually you don't get the perspective of the people behind the idea, they just do it cold heartedly. Getting the scientists themselves inevitably involved in the same situation as their clients/patients, they get to see the ethical dilemma and attempt to make it right.Now, this itself is an ethical dilemma: do you respect these people's initial decision to forget? Do you forcibly get them a chance to remember? This gets me back to the idea from the first paragraphs: in real life, there are people or circumstances that rake up the corner where you minimized the painful memory and trigger a wave of remembrance. Can you detach yourself, because it's so long ago and you've long left it behind? Will remembering make a significant impact on your current life?I enjoyed the insight of how irresponsible they are while playing with a person's brain ‚Äì booze, drugs, sex, oblivious to warning signs.Occasionally the time jumps were confusing and the cyclic ending clears things up. It was perfect for starting the movie over just to see some of the details from the first part again, to get all the subtleties. Clementine's hair color actually contributes to keeping track of the jumps.Jim Carrey as Joel and Kate Winslet as Clementine are both gorgeous and give wonderful performances. For him, this is much closer to the Truman Show Jim that any other I've seen. Kate looks very young, she's amazingly beautiful this woman. Her performance makes me understand why guys fall for somewhat crazy or unstable women ‚Äì and also makes me see, honestly speaking, that every woman has this type of moments. Then again I compared Clementine/Kate to Tiffany/Jennifer Lawrence from the Silver Linings Playbook of 2012 and wondered (again) how come these kind of roles get the awards and praise.Beautiful movie. Will be revisiting sometime in the future.\n",

      "Joel has a quarrel with his girlfriend, Clementine. She, somehow, forgets her memories about Jim. So he tries to make up with her but he can't. He gets angry and he also deletes his recollections about the time when he has lived with her. While they are being wiped out, he regrets asking the hospital which is specialized in brain to make him oblivious. He struggle not to forget the memories in his consciousness.At first I can't understand this story because the time and places changes one after another. It is an elaborate work, which is due to the director and casts.This story is so unique that I am excited with it. If memories can be deleted in the real, I do not want to do so. Because past is becoming more and more brilliant as time goes by, I believe. Even if it was hard then to put up with what you had experienced, several years later it will be one of the great or important things.This film may give us a chance to reconsider the relationships with people who we love. We need to review our history to find something really important.\n",

He is aware of that she erased the memories with him by a special machine, therefore he decides to erase the memories with her as well. At the first part of the story, I thought that this story was complex and I could not understand. What is worth, the same scenes were repeated many times and I was confused. However, I started noticing that this is very heart-warming story between the man and the woman. I got to feel that the true love is strong and no one can interfere with it. And I also felt that they cannot erase the memories with each other because they love each other even though they do not notice. I recommend everyone to watch the film because this story is a little different from other love stories. It is moving and heart-warming story.\n",

      "Jim Carrey plays shy, buttoned-down Joel. Kate Winslet plays outgoing free spirit Clementine. Opposites do attract so when Joel and Clementine meet they fall for one another right away. But unbeknownst to them they've done this before. They met, fell in love, had a two-year relationship. They don't know any of this because each has had the other erased from their mind. Yes, there's a company, Lacuna, that can do such a thing, erasing any memories you don't want anymore. And with that this movie is off, spinning some wild and crazy circles as it travels through time and through Joel's mind.After the initial setup we go back in time a bit to the point where Joel, much to his dismay, realizes Clementine has erased him. He decides to do the same to her and here things get delightfully trippy. Most of the rest of the film takes place inside Joel's head as he undergoes the erasure procedure. As the Lacuna technicians do their thing there is a major complication. Joel changes his mind. He wants to call it off, wants to hold onto his memories of Clem. Unfortunately while undergoing the procedure the subject is quite unconscious so Joel has no way of communicating this. Inside his own head he struggles to hold onto Clem. Clem is right there with him inside his head to help. The pair of one-time lovers tries to find places for themselves inside hidden corners of Joel's mind. The Lacuna techs realize something is amiss and redouble their efforts to zap Clementine right out of Joel's head. The head of the company is called in to personally oversee the procedure. If possible the movie's story gets even more tangled. This movie definitely is not short on twists.It all sounds very confusing but it's really not. A complicated story to be sure but as it is presented here a story that is easy to follow. And it's a story you can't help but embrace, as charming as it is captivating. Through all the ups and downs, all the twists and turns, you root so hard for Joel and Clem. You desperately want to see them together. Carrey and Winslet perform their respective parts so wonderfully. Carrey is a revelation with none of the outlandish look-at-me stuff he's known for. His character is grounded and he turns in a suitably grounded performance. Carrey's the straight man, it's Winslet who gets to be delightfully kooky. Winslet brings great energy, great personality and great hair to the character of Clem. The two stars are ably supported by the actors playing the Lacuna staff. Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson each bring something unique to the film. Initially it seems they are all unimportant bit players, that the movie is all about Joel and Clem, with Carrey and Winslet having the only important parts to play. But the movie weaves the Lacuna bunch into the story very smartly. It's a brilliantly constructed story from writer Charlie Kaufman, who specializes in these wonderful mindbenders. Director Michel Gondry brings Kaufman's story to life perfectly. The result is a movie which is both very entertaining and incredibly charming. This is a wonderfully unique movie which you will always want to hold in your memory.\n",

      "this film will change the way you see romantic comedies ,even the way you watch films,i personally love this movie for its originality with its overall plot and editing style.the film follows the relationship of Joel played by Jim Carey and Clementine played by Kate winslet ,both actors are superb in their roles and i thoroughly enjoyed watching Jim Carey act so serious but evoke such grace ,and sympathy .he really is a extremely versatile actor and this film proves that.i don't want to spoil much but the basic plot is that these the main characters have a messy break up and Clementine erases her memory without Joel knowing,once Joel realizes he rushes to do the same but most of the film takes place within Joel's mind as we get to see his memories of his relationship while they are being erased.it is only during the operation that he realizes he doesn't want to erase Clementine.the story puts a wonderful what if scenario in the world of romantic comedies and thanks to some amazing transitions you'll definitely remember this film.the film ends with a great personal and positive message that will make you feel all warm and gooey on the inside .eternal sunshine is a very visually appealing film with very likable characters ,as the film progresses you begin to really enjoy the two main characters and watching them together with some great chemistry between Kate winslet and Jim Carey.i can definitely say you've never seen Jim like this as he plays a socially awkward and lonely character ,my only gripe is that at times he did feel almost too depressing to watch although there are some great light hearted scenes near the end of the film that let us smile at Jim's goofy personality.the supporting cast are fantastic with Kirsten dunst and Elijah wood .these guys all work great together and it shows.AFTER YOU WATCH THIS FILM YOU WILL WANT TO WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN\n",

      "How many bad relationships have you had? Relationships that keep you from moving forward for one reason or another? What if someone offered you a simple solution that would only take one evening and cost a nominal fee? Would you take it?When we first meet Joel Barish (played by Jim Carrey), he's waking up in his home, wearing pajamas he doesn't recognize. It's Valentine's Day and, rather than go to work, he makes a spur of the moment decision to visit Montauk. As is typically the case with beach communities in the off-season, Montauk is deserted. Then, unexpectedly, Joel sees a woman on the beach. He wonders why he \"falls in love with every woman\" he sees who shows him \"the slightest bit of attention\". He encounters the same woman when he orders breakfast at a local restaurant and then, one final time, on the train home. The woman (played by Kate Winslet) introduces herself without any prompting. Her name is Clementine and she and Joel are getting off at the same stop. Their initial interaction makes Joel rather uncomfortable, he being the quiet, reserved type while Clementine is very outgoing and gives little thought to other peoples' opinions of her. Additionally, she has great disdain for generic adjectives like \"nice\", a word Joel uses more than once during their time on the train. When Joel spots Clementine walking home he offers to give her a ride and she accepts. When they arrive at her apartment, Clementine invites Joel up to her place for a drink and, despite the differences between them, or maybe as a result of them, Joel is intrigued. They take a late night trip to see the frozen Charles River and their romance progresses. The following morning, they arrive at Clementine's once again, Joel driving while Clementine slept, and she asks if they can go to his place and sleep there. She enters her apartment to retrieve some personal items and Joel, waiting in the car, is approached by a stranger who inquires as to why Joel is there. The conversation is awkward and short. Then, Clementine returns and they depart. Next, the credits begin rolling and we are shown an obviously distraught Joel. That is when the story really begins.I go back and forth on the subject of non-linear storytelling. There are some stories that seek to make themselves seem interesting by showing the elements out of order and others that are genuinely enhanced by jumping from one point in time to another. I believe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind falls in the second category. The creative manner by which they depict those elements of the story that take place within the mind of the main character, the subplots involving the unprincipled technicians performing the procedure add a whole new dimension to an already engrossing tale. Carrey and Winslet are both at the top of their games and, in my opinion, Carrey was never better before and hasn't been since. This is an amazing movie. See it.\n",

      "This is more than a film, if it connects with you then it is an emotional journey. Depressing, devastating and powerful. This may sound like a pretentious comment to make and I almost cringe saying it but I have seen very few films with this level of depth and quality. The ending I believe is open to interpretation, are you a pessimist or an optimist. Do they meet in Montauk and live happily, is the perpetual cycle of romance then stale hostile separation the destiny of the character and all of us? The things that you love about someone when you are in the first throws of romance often tend to be the things that drive you to hate them when things slide away. Some of the scenes when Joel is fighting agains the procedure are heart wrenching. 'I wish I stayed.' To anyone who has a reflective personality I think it was easy to identify with the hopeless situation and how life could be different.I first watched this about 7 years ago and I had to watch it the following day. The storyline is complicated at times being layered with flashbacks and the timeline can be confusing on first viewing but it pays off. It's totally original and the idea of memory removal was not what I was expecting when I first watched it but I loved the way I had no idea where it was going.You know when Kaufman and Gondry are involved you will get something abstract and artistic and they don't disappoint here. I'm not a Jim Carey fan usually but he fits the role well, being an odd and almost irritating character. There is not a bad performance in this film. Fantastic soundtrack. This remains one of the finest films I have seen.Avoid becoming the dining dead.\n",

      "The premise of this movie was novel and clever and the performances by both the main characters were good. The use of her dyed hair as both a symbol and a time marker were great, as they added depth to the movie.The music and emotion in the movie were both great. When Carrey finally realizes he doesn't want his memories to be erased is the beginning of the great part of the movie. Knowing all his memories are going to be erased helps add a nice touch and finally his acceptance gives good closure.I felt that the ending was bittersweet, as I have been in a horrible relationship before. Though knowing their entrance into what would play out to be a horrible relationship, they still enter it anyways, giving a sense of truth to the movie - I feel a couple in the same circumstances would do it again if their memories were erased.The ending memory sequence of them in the house as it begins falling apart is definitely my favorite scene from the movie.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a phenomenal movie with a fantastic cast and inspired story line, some great emotional drama, and a bit of comedy in there too. It's definitely one of Jim Carrey's most human performances, where we really get to see him as a serious actor, instead of loud and crazy, though I do love his characters such as Llyod Christmas, Ace Ventura and Truman Burbank.It's a masterfully written script that you really have to keep focused on in order to understand, scenes are shown out of sequence and the overall film would probably make more sense if they were shown in a different order, but it would not have been half as good.The movie is also heartbreaking, filled with so much aching moments for several characters, Joel and Clementine's relationships is particularly beautiful, but hard to watch at times, immensely tearjerking. Their final dialogue together is absolutely magnificent and some of the best work I have seen from Carrey and Winslet, which says an awful lot.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) falls in to a depression on Valentine's day after his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) breaks up with him, so he decides to erase his entire memory of her entirely, but it comes with complications.\n",

      "Story/Plot - Joel Barish (Carey) a normal working, down on his luck guy takes a gamble and skips work one day. This day happens to bring his luck up, he meets the gorgeous Clementine (Winslet) and together they start a relationship and things couldn't be better. Or could they.Clementine decides to have a procedure to erase Joel from her memories. Angered by this Joel decides to undergo the same procedure but in doing so he makes a massive realisation. He still loves Clementine and will do anything to get her back into his life. Is it to late for Joel whose memories are spiralling out of his mind or will he be able to win his girl back.My verdict - At first when I read up on this film I was a bit unsure if Jim Carey would be able to pull of a non comedy role but he has proved me wrong and not just pulled it off but gone even further and made this role his own. Complimented by Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst this film is outstanding and shows a story of true love and desire. I recommend this a must for all to watch.\n",

      "There is something magical about this movie. Maybe its the tragic confusion. Maybe its the beautiful handy-cam filming in portions. Maybe its Kate Winslet's hair.Or maybe its just Jim Carrey's eyes. He conveys his pain, elation, hatred, and confusion all at once. With just one look! His Best-Actor Oscar nomination was the least the man deserved. I do not grieve his not bagging it that year. In my head‚Äîas in countless others‚Äî he is a winner alright. His transformation from the split-up acts to the passionately emotional man is awe-inspiring. He does it with true √©lan.On the other hand, the eternally confused yet endearing Winslet is a garish treat to the eyes. Sadly, every time I watch the movie, I am so overwhelmed by Carrey that I cannot focus on the other characters enough to appreciate them individually. Together they create a beautifully surreal aura of utter confusion and rhapsody.Not to say the screenplay, direction, and other finer points are absolute brilliance too, contributing to the wonderful characterization of longing to hold on to the one you love. Forgive me for not enunciating on them, I shall not write of what I don't grasp completely. Yet, what I do grasp is that Joel and Clementine speak out to all those who have loved and lost as well those who have loved, almost lost, yet held-on.Though this movie seems completely out-worldly, there is a unique honesty in it's words that enthrall me. After all...\"Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.\"\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is an odd film but in a good way. If you've seen screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's earlier offerings \"Being John Malkovich\" & \"Adaptation\" then you have an idea of what I mean.Here, a man distraught that his girlfriend has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory decides to undergo the same treatment himself. However, when it's too late to turn back, he begins to have second thoughts and tries to hold on to his suddenly precious memories.That, in a nutshell, is what the movie's about. While the premise and the the execution mix science fiction and fantasy the story remains accessible throughout. It does so because Kaufman managed to capture the essence of the messy nature of love & relationships in his (deservedly) Oscar-winning script.Bringing the script to life are a small but well-assembled cast that includes Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet in the leading roles. Naturally, Winslet is excellent as always (hence her Academy Award nomination) but Carrey certainly held his own as well. In fact, this may be his most memorable dramatic performance to date. Apart from the principals, there's sturdy support from notables such as Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst & a few others in smaller roles.Visually, the movie is quite attractive. Director Michel Gondry deftly handled the script's many surreal settings and transitions with style to spare. The editing also deserves praise in that regard, as does the cinematography in the greater scheme of things. However, when it comes to the music, I can't say that I'm especially fond of Jon Brion's score or Beck's contribution to the soundtrack.Ultimately, though, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" not only delivers a vibrant visual experience, it also supplies plenty of mental stimulation as well. So, if you're looking for something original, entertaining & thought-provoking, look no further.\n",

      "This is a neat very competently made film about relationships in our post- modern age. The fact that is employs a science fiction concept (erasing memories) doesn't detract from its true genre: drama. Interestingly, that Jim Carrey's best films were his two dramas, this and The Truman Show (also based on a science fiction concept of an artificial city of actors that created an artificial life for the one non-actor in the city, Carrey). That's fundamentally because comedies lack the dramatic firepower and affecting depth that can be reached by drama. Overall, this is a really solid and well executed drama with a small touch of experimental elements but it is not as remotely as sophisticated as, let's say, Tarkovsky film's.\n",

      "Refreshingly original! Charlie Kaufman has a knack of coming up with these outright creative and never-thought-before stories. Sunshine is like an Odyssey into a lover's mind who has decided to erase the memories of his failed affair, but during this procedure, he realizes that beyond the fights, there are some memories that he actually cherishes. This could have been another run-of-the-mill love story, but Charlie combined it with this creativity and produced a bizarre piece of cinema. One thing I really love about Charlie kaufman is that he has the ability to create a different dream world through his screenplay. He did this by creating the 7 1/2 floor in \"Being John malkovich\" and he did it again by taking us inside Jim's brain where Kate's memories were being erased one-by-one - Jim's desperateness at losing Kate, shooting scenes in the light of a torch, people/things disappearing one-by-one as they are being erased - astounding, brilliant, riveting! Even the little things like Kate's ever changing hair color leave you to question why is she doing it. Eventually, you get so immersed in Charlie Kaufman's wonderland that you stop asking and just stay in his world - bewildered at what he has created ! He creates a mystique which is so unique that it borders on insanity - one mistake and the whole movie would become pshycotic ! During all this madness, somewhere you realize that this actually is a love story and all that Jim is doing is to save Kate from being erased. They have so many beautiful memories. Its amazing how Charlie Kaufman managed to sequence all the scenes together to bring out such emotions in the viewer. For me the brilliance of Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is in that one scene when the memory of meeting kate for the first time on the beach is being erased. Jim sat with Kate for 30 seconds, first talking to her as it really happened, then talking to himself as how he felt during that conversation & finally, jim and kate being sad that the memory is being erased and this being the last memory of them together. One scene, 3 emotions, all being felt by the same guy - WoW! I liked Sunshine more than Charlie's other film, \"Being John Malkovich\". Both are outright creative, but Sunshine scores on the message and the tender feeling it leaves you with. I salute you Charlie Kaufman - you really are a genius!\n",

      "A film that defies an easy explanation in terms of plot is attached with an equally less revealing title. What is the \"Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind\"? Well, it stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in what I can only describe as a surreal romantic comedy drama from the inventive minds of Charlie Kaufman and the visionary French music video director Michel Gondry.The film opens with Joel Barish (Carrey) narrating that today is Valentines day. Bored of his usual routine, he spontaneously gets on a train heading the other way to his work and there stumbles upon Clementine (Winslet). They strike up a conversation and apart from the odd hiccups they get along. Little do either of them know, they were partners before and as the plot unravels we begin to realise that both had decided to wipe their memories of each other.The narrative goes back to when Joel wakes up after an argument with Clementine the night before. He goes to try to smooth things over, only to find that Clementine doesn't recognise him at all. From further investigation, Joel finds out that Clementine has embarked on a radical procedure that has resulted in her wiping all existence of Joel from her mind. As a reaction to this, Joel undergoes the same operation to do the same thing. From here on in, the film follows Joel's memories and he begins, though his unconscious mind, to remember why he loves Clementine.As the film is mainly set in the mind, the visuals and settings are vividly bought to life from recurring images and motifs. There are numerous humour filled moments using forced perspectives. Many of Gondry's visual tricks of repetition and surrealism come into play.For those of you expecting your usual Jim Carrey vehicle, you'll be very disappointed. None of his facial pulls or goofy antics are on show and his performance is akin to his other serious acting performances (The Truman Show, The Majestic and to some lesser extent, The Man on the Moon). As for Kate Winslet, she is always capable of pulling off a convincing performance as a kooky, hippy and impulsive woman.An original and invigorating story about a two people who fall out of love but fate and realization brings them back together. A unique insight into a couples love life. Through the highs and lows of the memories in Joel's mind, he comes to find that it's the faults and differences that make him attracted to Clementine. Watch with an open and clear mind and fall in love with a romantic comedy with a difference.\n",

      "This movie shows us how wanting to erase of an incident that happened may not be a good idea.We are primarily watching the film primarily through the mind of the lead character Joel Barish (Jim Carrey).Winning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, Eternal sunshine was a critical success, even financially.The movie was like being trapped in the mind of Joel and trying so hard to keep one thing from flying away, the memory of Clementine. We run through his life with Clementine (Kate Winslet) and wonder why they never seem to work it out.The director made some on the spot cuts from the movie, as this movie had a lot of deleted scenes all done to make the movie more presentable and make a balance between both lead characters.The director Michel Gondry (Be Kind Rewind (2008) and The Green Hornet (2011)) did a fine job with this movie as every moment you spend watching this movie is a moment in your memory you will not want erased.The movie is about two lovers, Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) who undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories because of how their relationship turned out.But as the process is being done, they discover how much they will lose when the memory is gone.This is one movie that will stand out in your books as one of the best movies you have seen.\n",

      "I wasn't expecting much, with Jim Carrey starring especially, but I was in for a huge shock. This was shockingly good. The big surprise for me was how a funny, smart idea (a company that erases memories, esp. of a relationship) turns out to be the basis of a gut-wrenching heartbreaker of a love story. The obvious quality of the movie is the brilliant script, which is why this is seen by many as the new Kaufman film. But that's only half the story. I think Michel Gondry has done an amazing job as well, in visualising very clearly some quite complex proceedings, with an understated humour, finding the perfect tone to suit the script - i.e. not too funny, not too sentimental either.Another surprise is Jim Carrey, who plays a character that's totally different from anything he's done before and does it brilliantly. It's the best film I've seen since Lilja 4-ever, and though I loved Being John Malkovitch, I rate this one a bit higher even.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine\" is highly original, going where few movies have gone before, with the notable exceptions of \"BJM\" and \"Adaptation\". The cast is familiar, we've seen them in quite a few movies by now, but here they each create something different. Kate Winslet is Clementine, the girl of many hair colors, who decides to rid herself of all memories of Joel (Jim Carrey). Mark Ruffalo, with his hair standing on end, is the computer nerd who hurriedly rushes to put his pants back on when Joel's reprogramming ends prematurely. Elijah Wood, with the long, long sideburns looks otherworldly (again) as the assistant computer nerd who woos Clementine post-brain damage. Kirsten Dunst is sweet and her hair is not much different from previously seen in other films as is Tom Wilkinson's, who is quite the ladies man in this pic. Mr. Carrey goes from trauma to trauma, and is in dire need of a haircut. Why my obsession with the cast members' hairstyles, you ask? Why do Joel and Clem walk on thin ice? Why does Clem work at Barnes & Noble? Why does the house fall down around them, literally? Why does Joel hide under the kitchen table and shrink? What does all this mean? That even though you get bored with someone and are embarrassed to be with them in public and say all kinds of mean things about them behind their backs, it's still likely that this is your one true love? That premise doesn't work for me. I see this film as a slight disappointment after the two previous Kaufman films I've mentioned, but superior to much of what's in theaters now.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine\" is a very clever film, where you have to think hard, particularly for the first half. The acting (and effects) are excellent. Because of the complexity of the plot, it was only in the second half that I began to (understand) and felt increasingly involved with what was going on.Brilliant scenes on the beach, flashbacks, imagining childhood, running from erasing memories and at the doctor's. Another part of the film's brilliance was to make the science fiction of memory removal become totally believable. And the progression of the plot never lets up, with constant addition of new aspects right up to the end.In contrast with some films where reality and fantasy are intentionally confused (which I generally find annoying) this film gives sufficient clues to help the viewer to identify the scenes which are reality from others that are flashbacks or imagination.A lot of lessons on relationships - particularly the ultimate value of memories, even if they are painful.\n",

      "Michael Gondry's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is hands down, the best film that came out in the 2000s (or let's call it a tie, with LOTR and Dark Knight sharing the title). The real credit goes to the screenwriter, who gives us a remarkable motion picture that is so profound in its ideas and allegory that one realizes that there can, and will, never be a film like this EVER again. \"Eternal Sunshine...\" is the story of a couple Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) who erase each other from their respective minds, thus losing all their memories of being together. What follows is a narrative, a very non-linear one at that, that takes place almost entirely in Joel's mind, as he goes through the many moments of his not-so-perfect yet beautiful relationship with Clementine for one last time and also tries desperately to somehow retain a few happy memories.But what ensues is just a confused, futile goose-chase that, quite obviously, ends in Clementine being erased from Joel's brain. The real intention of this film is brought about after this. Joel and Clementine, who meet again, come off as total strangers to each other and are once again forced into a fresh relationship.And as an outcome of a few supporting events, when they learn of their past, they are at first in disbelief, but then, they decide to still try to make it work, some how, even though they know it would probably end in another break up.Here is a movie that tells us how memories are the prime elements that make us human beings what we are. The whole idea of a human personality is based on the foundations laid by them. And these memories have made us what we are, and these memories will also be responsible for what we turn out to be in the future. The human mind cannot afford to simply lose the bad memories, because they are as essential and integral a part of our lives as the good ones. Human beings must understand the concept of learning from a bad memory and moving on, realizing that life works that way. No matter how Clementine and Joel want to forget each other, or in this case \"erase\", it is impossible for them to. This is because, of two reasons, one: that's how life works, we eventually end up encountering the things we've lost, and two: Fate. Simply putting it, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Sptoless Mind\" is an amazing, deep and beautiful film!\n",

      "Joel Barish (Jim Carry) falls in love with the Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and they are involved in a relationship for about two years when the relationship ends in detestation. The two individuals seek help from an organization that deletes parts of an individual's memory. The two fallow through with the procedure, then inadvertently find themselves in a relationship all over again. The company then through a series of intricate relations sends out invoices releasing information stating that the two have previously known each other. They realize that they have previously had relations and decide that it is worth the risk of failure to experience there relationship over again. The theme of the movie may be explained as a tragedy in that both Joel and Clementine lost the memories that made the relationship between them worth remembering. The theme could also be explained as a classic love story and how unbreakable the bonds of love may be. The end of the film when the characters discover their past relationship is an ideal example of the theme. The dialogue between Joel and Clementine is a representation of how the two of them chose to overcome their struggles as opposite minded individuals and continue on the relationship despite those differences. These thematic ideas of tragedy are reflected entirely different from all the aspects of the characters within the plot. However the tragedy still remains relevant to each characters part within the story. The tragic nature of The Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind can be juxtaposed with the tragic nature of Andrew Niccol's film The Truman Show, which also stars Jim Carry, and carries the thematic events relative to the classic love story genre. The lighting within the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind used excessive amounts of unnatural light to depict a type of surreal nature within the film. The lighting used when Joel was in a dream state would usually have this excessive brightness contrasted with the pure dark background to portray a sense of depression and emptiness. When the characters were in peaceful situations of retrospective happiness, the lighting was almost purely natural without any elements of harsh darkness. Intense colors within the film would attract the audiences attention to a certain aspect. Within Joel's dream state the black on white contrast focused the audiences attention to the importance of the characters and their movements, actions, and feelings. Outside of the dream state, the outstanding colors often were associated with Clementine and therefore draw more interest to her character and gave life to Joel's life. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind successfully inhibited the use of all these motifs to recreate the often-overused theme of the tragic love story. The true beauty of language and cinematography was not lost due to overacting or unsuccessful cinematography. The thematic ideas portrayed were in no way overplayed. The motifs of good film structure worked, as they should, in harmony within the film.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a surreal masterpiece dedicated to the fragility of human recollection. The film follows the bitter aftermath of a broken relationship, and the decision of the suffering couple to undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories. However, as Joel's memories of Clementine begin to slip away from him, he realizes that he has made a grave mistake. This typical case of recognizing what one has only when they have lost it is not bizarre or innovative in itself, but the manner in which director Michel Gondry (The Science of Sleep, Be Kind Rewind) presents the material is everything from mind blowing to solemnly beautiful. The movie is comprised of countless flashes between Joel's fading recollections, and his present life. Due to this, the greater part of the film takes place within the character's own mind, giving it a dreamlike, surreal feeling. Eternal Sunshine is one part classic love story, and one part trance-like cinematography. It cannot be denied, however, that this movie is eccentric, almost to the point of bafflement. But perhaps this is the magic of it ‚Äì that its sheer oddity and originality make it a film that viewers can either love or hate.\n",

      "This is a film I saw several years ago and immediately fell in love with. I thought it would be interesting to give it another viewing just to see how well it's stood up in the intervening years. Well I'm pleased to report, it does pretty well; if anything, I like it slightly more after this most recent viewing. I will tell you more after this brief summary.We begin with a couple meeting on a train for the first time. They are Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Everything seems to be going very well and then the mood suddenly changes. Joel is in his car banging his head against the steering wheel; very upset, almost inconsolable. He eventually finds out that Clementine has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory. Unable to live with that, he decides to do the same. It is through this process that we see their entire relationship from the end to the beginning. Will it be successful, or is Joel doomed to live with his grief? Well obviously I can't tell you that or the Spoiler Police will be erasing my memory (some say they already have!).Beautifully made with some outstanding (& very subtle) CGI; I really love the way small things are erased as a scene progresses, or they go out of focus so you get the impression of memories being lost. The performances are all excellent too; especially Jim Carrey as Joel Barish (I really wish he would take more parts like this, he's very good at it) and Kate Winslet who played Clementine Kruczynski perfectly; in fact she got an Oscar for it! Honourable mentions go to; Elijah Wood as Patrick, Mark Ruffalo as Stan, Kirsten Dunst as Mary and Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Mierzwiak.There are several sub-plots that I have not included in the main summary that serve to show the imperfections in the process Joel and Clementine have undergone. This takes the film to a higher lever for me, it illustrates that no matter what, there may be a person you are supposed to be with. I don't know whether that's true or not, but it's a concept that (I know) many cling to. But back to the film¬Ö",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind tells the story of a collapsed relationship. After Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) have an argument they break up and Joel soon discovers that Clementine has had her memory of him wiped. In a fit of rage Joel decides to go through the same procedure but whilst his memories of her begin to fade Joel realises how much he loves / likes Clementine and tries, in his strange unconsciousness to stop to the operation from taking effect.In terms of directing, the film is amazing, I loved the way it was shot - it was very clever and I thought quite beautiful at times. Script wise the same is true, the way in which Joel's memories are woven together is brilliant. On the surface what seems a very simple idea is actually incredibly well put together. The music, from Jon Brion, was also great and very apt. The way in which these three are put together is phenomenal, you'll want to laugh or cry and many times I couldn't help but break out a strange, very satisfied smile just because I was enjoying it so much.What I think maybe let this film down for me personally, was the kind of average acting. I thought Jim Carrey was good, but not amazing, I was just pleased he wasn't in his usual very slapstick type role. The same was true for Kate Winslet and the other characters in the film, they were all good but not amazing. I think a classic film should have characters that feel irreplaceable, for example I can't imagine anyone else but John Goodman and Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski, Russell Crowe in Gladiator or Clint Eastwood and co. in The Good, The Bad and The ugly. Admittedly there isn't a huge amount of drama in this film but there is some and its just done averagely.There were also two bits that bothered me. Firstly, Joel lies about the manner in which he met Clementine and then in his memory its as he described, not as it happened. Its probably me just being stupid and missing something but that didn't really make sense. Secondly I didn't think the ending was that wonderful, and I'm talking literally the last minute. This is my opinion though and I can see why people might thought that it actually made for a fitting end, it just wasn't my cup of tea.I didn't love this film and given its seriously high rating on this website, and what I'd heard from other people I was a tiny bit let down. I can see why people do think its so fantastic and that it might be a classic for some, it just wasn't for me. Nevertheless, I think I've probably just been nit picking a great deal, I'm sorry if I've taken away something from this film because it is amazing. I've not seen anything like it before and you should definitely go and see it!\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine draws confusion from me when I first saw it. Relationship per se is complicated and much more complicated because of two unique individuals involve. For me, Sunshine means happiness with the word eternal make it long lasting, from this, I conclude that having empty slate will makes us happy which contradicts the human nature. Memories, good or bad, can be perceived both as inspiration and learning ground, why do we want to eradicate someone in our life that easy? Isn't that completely dumb? --- Wasting years of learning and appreciating what you had. For the past 20 years of my life, people just come or go, some stayed for a while and some stayed for the longest but each one of them left a mark even not in my heart (which they correlate with love, but I guess it's a clich√© too) but in my hippocampus even short term or long term they will always stay under my subconscious. Spotless mind is really being clueless, its subjecting yourself to undergo suppression of the human mind by unconscious forgetting, its controlling the nature of the human. Its not bad that sometimes we wanted to break-free by forgetting the world and be forgotten by world, that makes us entirely human. Let happiness outweigh the bad in the relationship; don't let the relationship breaks in front of you. Let experiences be worth reminiscing for both of you, lingers in every single neuron in your brain. Fights, arguments, pressures, distance, indifferences are part of every single relationship so don't ever think that because you are having troubles every time its not worth fighting for, that sometimes we think that Mr./Ms. Right is out there, we could never find that person unless we learn how to build a solid foundation of memories and experience from both to build the right relationship. Love is not about instinct, it couldn't be learned nor taught, love could never be defined by people that are not involve, and what they saw --- until the end of the day those people wont be experiencing the same thing you'll have and they will never regret the things that you will lose. It takes two to keep the ball rolling, its not a basketball game that we could pass every problems we couldn't handle. People will just you as superficial so never take their advice, because you don't want to suffer because of their senseless senses remember even there is the word \"empathy\" they could not have your shoe when things turn to crap. Just live life and let life flows.\n",

      "This is one of those movies that are genuine pieces of art; a very rare thing. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a truly beautiful film. It's cute, quirky and very deep. Joel Barish (portrayed beautifully by Carrey) is an \"every guy\". At least, that is how I feel. The movie's title is based on a beloved quote by Alexander Pope, which is very fitting given the context of the film: How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd; Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are an adorable team with great support from Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, David Cross, and others. The time-line of the film is very clever, but not too confusing. I feel obligated to mention the sound track as it is a fantastic atmosphere setter! I won't go into the plot as you've most probably read it on the title page. I really recommend this film, it's a milestone!\n",

      "This was a fun unexpected ride of a movie. I had no clue where this was going at first and the plot line uber original. I am so happy to see a movie that doesn't have the same 1,2,3 code that every other movie has. I think studios need to replace the old story plots with massive originality. And that is what this delivered. So Thank You for making a cool off-beat love story that even a dude can dig. I like the bus drive scene it was great and the surreal quality of their connections was fun to watch. To have someone you fall in love with and then get a broken heart is just human. What a concept to erase That memory. A strange, familiar chemistry these two have and I really think it's an awesome flick.\n",

      "Perhaps the most confusing love story ever to be told, and nonetheless this film is sufficiently lucid and sensible to bond with the regular audience. I remember someone addressing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as ''experimentalism and complexity for people who do not like experimentalism and complexity'', and it does sound correct, even though the suggestive romantic topic and star-filled cast may hold the huge portion of responsibility for the success.Once again it must be told, when featuring Kaufman at the writing process, nothing ordinary can be expected. This time, however, his mind seemed less inspired, at least when compared to everything else he has created, maybe forced to hold back on the eccentricity in consideration for the public's mainstream designate audience. Whatever the reason, it did not had a terrible affect on the movie, that is very good, although not as shiny as other ''Kaufman-esque'' pieces.Diving on the story, it is easy to sympathize with the characters, Carrey and Winslet allure is performed with perfection during both atmospheric and tempestuous portions. Their star overshadowed the annoying support of Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood, which despite having a significant importance, arouse nothing but irritation.After all it can be said that Gondry's enterprise was successful in all its purposes. The melancholic romance with a hopeful disconsolate outcome and psychological disturbances worked beautifully and it can be counted as a rare mind-bending movie that can be appreciated without bending the mind that much.\n",

      "Let me first say this is a fantastic movie. Very original and interesting. I loved the choice of music through out the entire movie. This is by no means a romance movie. Although the center of the movie is about a relationship of a guy and a girl, it is much more of a gender neutral movie that anyone can appreciate. It is a movie that makes you think quite a lot so stay away if you do not want that. Otherwise a good execution of a great plot and idea. My only negative about the movie is that it took me a bit after I finished the movie to completely understand it. It left me confused until about twenty minutes after when everything clicked. I liked it a lot even when I was a little confused, but once I fully grasped everything, the movie then became one of my all time favorites.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a finely balanced piece of film making. The combination of imaginative screen play (by Charlie Kaufman) and acute directing (by Michel Gondry) is one that produces an original, thought-provoking love story. Narrated in a non-linear fashion, we are hooked in straight away with the meeting of our two leads; Joel Banish (Jim Carrey) is a shy, and despondent gentleman who has no love or excitement in his life. Whilst going about his daily routine of going to work, he randomly has a change of heart and without a thought jumps on a train to Montuak. He is greeted by Clementine Kyskovi (Kate Winslet) a free spirit who is driven by her impulses and feelings. During the early exchanges they both play off each other, as if to show opposites attracting by a chance meeting on a train journey.However after the credits, we re-join at the moment the couple are coming to the end of their relationship and in doing so find out the principle idea behind the films plot. The fascinating concept of being able to erase parts of ones memory if they so desired, which is no doubt the question you will be asking yourself long after the film's finale. So we watch our lead male undergo 'surgery' as it were, a sci-fi process which the director has portrayed skilfully and realistically.As the story continues, dipping in and out of Joel consciousness, we are never lost as the Director shoots in a timely manner with scenes that are allowed time to breathe. There's a charming moment that the director has managed to transcend through the screen, and its when the two protagonists are lying on ice looking up into the camera as if we are the stars. What I like about the directing, is the fact that the deep premise of ESSM could have easily been produced in the same confusing manner much like 'Momento & Inception', however the team have kept everything rather simplistic (in comparison) and this is i believe, to its advantage.Jim Carrey in a serious role hits the mark and possibly because he is restrained from being the funny guy, he suppress a lot of his excitement and natural mad acts that it actually fits perfectly with how Joels personality is meant to be perceived. Kate Winslet is a burst of colourful energy that even though crazy at times, the audience and Joel are always drawn back to her because of her likability and infectious character. The supporting cast makes sure the film continues the high standard throughout with performances by Tom Wilkingson, Kirstin Dunst, Ellijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo.A key message that is portrayed during the film and that a lot of people will relate to is the old clich√© \"you don't know what you go till its gone\" none more so then Joel, who fights to keep hold of the cherished memories. Just as there are bad times there are good times and its both experiences that define who we are. If we erased moments in life, how would it define who we are today..? Some questions are left unanswered and perhaps this is the way it should be; open to interpretation, take from the movie what you will. Yet, what Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is however; is an emotionally powerful near perfect story telling, one that you should not miss out on.\n",

      "Hey guys, this movie is brilliant. I always make it sure that I watch a movie above the 8 rating in IMDb and it was worth the watch. The name of the movie says it all \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\" It's mind-blowing, very interesting, and outstanding. Jim Carrey's role is brilliant and so is Kate Winslet. You get a taste of what it feels like to watch a crazy, wackadoo like Jim with the Titanic star Kate. Needless to say that, Kate's personality in this movie is more or less matching that of Jim's. She is witty, humorous, and darn interesting. While Jim is sort of serious man going over his daily life like any other ordinary employee. On meeting Kate, Jim's life turn upside down. But the main twist in the movie is when they erase their minds and ultimately they realize that they were made for each other. An 18 year old like me would love this movie.\n",

But you won't figure out it is until the end. If you figure it out. With a distorted sense of time and an interesting narrative style, Eternal Sunshine is a unique film that will exercise your mind in more than one way.Eternal Sunshine is a romance with sci fi elements. It's fantastic. Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really great, and have true chemistry: Carrey, the awkward Everyman, dressed in all brown, and Winslet the quirky, upbeat girl with vibrant colours. Seeing them together makes you smile.The four other supporting cast members work well together. Ruffalo as the nerd-type scientist, Elijah Wood as his bud, who is kind of weird, Kirsten Dunst as the the secretary who offers up a twist of her own, and Tom Wilkinson, who I have yet to see as a faithful man in a role. They're good distractions in a two-person film.The film has a dreamy, quirky atmosphere, like my favourite film Donnie Darko. They actually have a few connections: love stories, lonely leading men, upbeat original music, and twists that demand a second viewing.If you like relatable characters, an original and well-scripted plot, or critically acclaimed movies, see this: it's arguably the best romance ever. If you hate happiness, don't see it. You'll feel great after seeing this. 8.7/10\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a well-directed film by Michel Gondry, starring Jim Carrey as Joel Barish, and Kate Winslet as Clementine Kruczinski. Joel is a shy man who has trouble meeting new females, and Clementine is an extremely outgoing girl who always speaks her mind. Eventually, the two get together, but their relationship begins to spoil, and in an attempt to free her self from the troubled life she feels trapped in, Clementine takes part in a procedure to have all her memories of Joel erased. Once Joel discovers the procedure that Clementine has had done to her, he then decides to do the same for himself. This is the basic story of this film, but it is not necessarily shown in this order. One of the top reasons that this movie reflects postmodernism is through its non-linear structure. The audience never truly understands the order of events until the very end of the movie when the puzzle of scenes is finally put together. As soon as the movie begins, the audience gets to witness Joel and Clementine seemingly meeting each other for the first time. They keep running into each other at a beach, a diner, and a train station. Without any further information the viewers automatically assume that this is their first encounter with each other. However, as the film goes on, it is eventually realized that the scenes in the beginning that show their encounters with each other actually take place after their memories get erased. The concept is brilliant, leaving audience members to question: \"Why didn't I see that coming?\" Another way this film represented postmodernism was through its multiple character perspectives. The story was not just about the lives of Joel and Clementine. Kirsten Dunst plays an employee working for the business that erases these relationship memories and her character eventually realizes that she too has undergone the process of getting her memories erased. The film jumps from perspective to perspective, always explaining to the audience each character's point of view. Elijah Wood's character falls for Clementine, and in a brief little monologue by him, the audience understands why. This is an excellent film that dives deep into the lives of two totally different people together in a relationship.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine is a philosophical analysis of the nature of love and relationships. It reflects very well the changing emotions associated with falling in love and the ups and downs of personal relationships, and how unnecessary it is to erase our emotional past to survive. None of this is said or discussed in the movie, as this is a metaphorical film that uses the visual narrative to approach these points.Eternal Sunshine is one of those movies that many people would see twice to fully catch all the details because the editing and what happens in the film is complex since there are three different time moments, narrated in not chronological order, sometimes overlapping each other. It is not a film for simple minded people or those who have to have everything digested and masticated before presented to them. This film needs of an attentive attention and mental involvement.Jim Carrey surprises every body with a role that shows what a great actor he is, and how versatile too. He's superb as Joel, a lonely insecure and depressed guy who tends to get involved with women who are the opposite, and how he faces love, abandonment, rejection, loneliness, companionship, etc. Also excellent (and outside of their usual roles) is Kate Winslet in her role as Clementine, a cheeky cheerful girl addicted to flashy hair dyes, who is attracted to boring men.The lyricism of the music, the surreal scenes, the poetic cinematography, the part of the movie showing Joel efforts to preserve the memories of the past he initially wanted to destroy, the fact that the special effects are no such a thing but camera tricks and the result of a meticulous preparation and tampering of the movie sets, adds even more artistic value to this unique piece. The director and the editor of the film really deserve a big praise, as the movie is indebted to them beyond belief.The only flaws I saw in the movie are the little romance mini-stories related to the technicians and doctor of the Lacuna Clinic, which do not contribute much to a film that otherwise would have been perfect, and the outcome linked to those actions could have been presented in a different way.I would not call this movie a comedy, but a light drama.Eternal Sunshine is a magical, unique and unforgettable movie. A piece of art, really.\n",

      "Usually when I sit down to watch a Jim Carrey film I end up getting a little irritated by his excessive gurning; thankfully there is none of that here. Carrey plays Joel Barish a man who decides to skip work one day and takes the train to Montauk where he takes a walk on the beach, later he meets Clementine, a girl with bright blue hair who he gets talking to on the way home. He offers to take her home and then something strange happens¬Ö",
      " he goes to see her at the shop she works in and she acts as if she doesn't recognise him and later he is told that she has had all memories of him clinically erased! He goes to the clinic and after learning as much as they are free to tell him decides to have all memories of her erased too. Things then get rather complicated as he relives various moments in an apparently long relationship as they are deleted, during the procedure he realises that he doesn't want to forget her and tries to find a way of protecting at least one memory of her. Meanwhile the people erasing his memories are having their own problems; one of them is trying to seduce Clementine himself and while he is off the other loses Joel so must call in his boss which in tern leads to more secrets being exposed.This is a hard film to describe as much of the action is non-linear and the viewer is deliberately confused about what is happening at any given moment. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are great as Joel and Clementine and other cast members, including Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood do well too. While this is clearly science fiction due to the memory erasing it doesn't look like stereotypical sci-fi; everything looks like things in the present day look; even the memory erasing machine looked like medical machinery rather than some futuristic device one might expect. Even if you aren't a fan of Jim Carrey films this is worth checking out; in fact I suspect it is worth watching more than once as it felt like the sort of film that will make more sense on the second viewing!\n",

The movie is a realization that only when we begin to lose someone,we realize that we just want to cling on to that person forever because there definitely was something about him/her that attracted us to that person in the first place and we shouldn't take that for granted and focus on their other annoying habits etc.\n",

Charlie Kaufman's forceful counter-argument to Henry Ford's \"History is bunk!\" is arguably his most accomplished and moving story to date.At the public screening I caught, couples-watching was compulsory. In the row in front of me, a young man made as if to caress his girlfriend's shoulder, as she subtly, perhaps unconsciously, pulled away, while his hand dropped slowly to his lap again.

      "Have you ever in love so deeply and suddenly you have to break up? That's the feeling you will get from watching thiz movie. The feeling is about how you fall in love with a girl and later you realize that time will never come back again. It is starred by Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Mark Rufallo and Kirsten Dunst. The movie is directed by French Director, Michel Gondry. Gondry always brings some absurd stories for his movies like in \"The Science of Sleep\" (2006) which I also like very much. The story is about dreaming the past but only you can actually feel it as it just happens at the present time. Sometimes it happens based on what you remember. Thiz is an interesting part, at one of the scenes the two characters (Carrey and Winslet) have interaction with each other and then they are surrounded by people who have blank faces, because Carrey's character don't remember how the people look like, so the scene describes those people with blank faces. The Director is so lucky to get Carrey and Winslet in appropriate time, Carrey who just desperately wants some serious drama beside his comedian roles, and Winslet wants to prove her true acting skill after \"Titanic\" (1997). Thiz movie doesn't contain an extraordinary storyline, but surely it can reflect the description about how the event happens.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com\n",

      "Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's better-received Being John Malkovich was an amusing but cold oddity; director Michel Gondry's Science of Sleep was not particularly amusing and sickly cute. Sandwiched between was this loving, subtly cautionary romantic 'dramedy' about a young man, Joel (Jim Carrey), undergoing a fantastical scientific operation to remove all memory of his ex-girlfriend, the eccentric Clementine (Kate Winslet). The procedure draws him deep into his subconscious, and we're invited along for the ride. This second collaboration between Kaufman and Gondry (after 2001's Human Nature) has deservedly become something of a cult favourite.Forget Garden State: while Eternal Sunshine shares a desire to explore the truth behind the human condition through a skewed fish-eye lens, it is mercifully free of that film's cloying sentimentality, its narcissism, and its contempt for a mainline predefined as banal. In Garden State, people are kooky but phony, shallow and self-absorbed; Eternal Sunshine's Joel, meanwhile, is powerless against his absorption into the strange fearful passions of his dreams. With impressive psychological literacy, Kaufman and Gondry's film shows us the selfishness of human desire and are - crucially - critical of it. Hollywood loves nothing more than to make lovers of ill-suited characters thrown together by circumstance. Not so here: the joy of watching Joel and Clementine's relationship blossom - and fade - is that it is a product of choice as much as chance, and so it is believable.Winslet puts in a signature performance; her Clementine is the extrovert to Carrey's Joel. Carrey, meanwhile, scribbles out his signature entirely: nary a mug passes across his face. His is a soulful turn of poise and intelligence.Eternal Sunshine finds its home on DVD - by the third or fourth viewing you should have the fractured narrative pretty much sussed. Plus, it's ideal night-in viewing: warm, friendly, funny, and profound. In a cynical and ironic era, it's heartening to watch a film that finds love so alive and so precious. A classic.\n",

      "After a long-term relationship goes sour, Joel (Jim Carrey) is shocked to learn that Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him erased from her memory. Joel decides to undergo the same procedure himself, but decides midstream that some memories are worth hanging onto. Charlie Kaufman's films explore the workings of the human mind: 'Adaptation (2002)' traced the neurotic exchanges between an artist and his art; 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)' is about how memories influence our relationships with others; I'm yet to work out what 'Being John Malkovich (1999)' was all about, but at least it had fun going about it. As was the case with Spike Jonze, Kaufman found in Michel Gondry a director who shared his unique perspective on life and art. 'Eternal Sunshine' is eccentric without being outwardly quirky, and Gondry's creative flair for optical trickery (sharpened through his work on music videos) is perfect for recreating the labyrinthine cubicles of the human mind.'Eternal Sunshine' is perhaps the only film I've seen whose narrative moves both forwards and backwards at the same time. It has been said that \"those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.\" The film concludes with a single memory skipping back on itself, suggesting that Joel and Clementine are trapped in this endless cycle of \"love,\" heartbreak and erasure for the rest of their lives {indeed, an early screenplay draft depicted this idea more explicitly}. This outcome is mirrored in the relationship between Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst), who repeat their affair even after Mary undergoes the Lacuna procedure. As in 'Adaptation,' this ending demonstrates Kaufman's talent for depicting failure in the misleading guise of hope; just as Nicolas Cages' screenwriter flounders in his attempts to write an original Hollywood script, Joel and Clementine willingly doom themselves towards a life almost entirely devoid of lasting memories.\n",

If you don't care for his comedy, don't worry.Very slight spoiling here: The last lines (not quoting them to avoid any actual spoiling) say much in a few words. Eternal Sunshine has the kind of plot line to happily set us up toward a reveal or twist; it does an unusually good job of setting us up for lines that makes us think and consider life. Well done.

      "While Jim Carrey (thankfully) breaks away from his tiresome norm of Pet-Detecting craziness in order to inhabit mild and pleasant Joel Barrish, the idea behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is neither mild nor pleasant; it's a swirling vortex of thoughts and emotions that delves right to the very core of the human psyche. Basic Premise: after a disastrous relationship, Barrish revolts against an experimental therapy that can permanently wipe painful or scarring memories, after deciding that he would rather remember the times he and his ex-girlfriend had together. The main chunk of the film then centres around Carrey frantically darting around his own mind witnessing his own memories disappearing and desperately trying to stop it; for the audience, it's a bizarre and moving experience. Light floods the most vivid memories, while the suppressed, scarier ones are surrounded by darkness. Other memories literally melt away as he approaches them; and some he doesn't even realise he still has resurface. It really is a fantastic showcase of selective and effective special effects. It's also a brilliantly original concept, and with a RomCom bent sewn into its very core, surprisingly accessible. Unique, powerful and thought-provoking, Eternal Sunshine is a brilliant visual representation of the human mind that will stay with the memory for years to come. And you don't even mind Carrey that much.\n",

      "Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) is informed that his ex-girlfriend Clementine(Kate Winslet) who he was romantically involved with has had her parts of her memories erased, the memory of there relationship. The procedure was done by Dr. Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson) and the people that work for him. Mainly to get even he decides to get the same procedure done to himself. While the people that work for Dr. Mierzwiak go to work on Joel Barish, Joel changes his mind but the procedure is still going with his body paralyzed, but he struggles in his mind to save the memories of Clementine from being deleted. And that is basically the premise of the film, and when I first read the synopsis I thought it would be a dumb film but decided to give it a try anyways and too my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a bizarre but intriguing film and it's wonderful in some areas as well, it also strives to be original as well. A lot of aspect of this film is absurd especially the whole procedure although it is some what fascinating but just ridiculous, but it's entirely forgivable since entire erasing of Joel's memories serves as just a backdrop to the whole film. Watching this film was like watching a bizarre dream come to life, with it dealing with love, romance and memories. The time period change can get a bit confusing though since Gondry's visual 'clues' are subtle and the character Jim Carrey played wasn't lovable and don't care as much if he able to overcome his angst, which is some of the gripe I have with the movie. It would have been nice if they pushed the character creativity a bit further. I also found it to be a bit self indulgent which is okay, but also seem to drag the film at times. The film isn't complex or deep as some people claim it to be, it's a straight forward story but a good one.7.9/10\n",

      "I admit that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was not my cup of tea and looking at voting history on IMDb and my friends own Facebook accounts, this is a film very popular with women. However I respect that it was a creative bit of film-making, showing that Michel Gondy was a skilled director and that Jim Carrey is more then a physical comedian.The story of the film is focused on Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), a couple who just broke up. When Joel tries to make up with Clementine he discovered that she had her memories of Joel erased and was with another man. This leaves Joel heartbroken and goes for the same process. However when he goes through with the process and the further back in his mind he goes he discoveries what and why he loved Clementine in the first place and he fights to try and keep hold of his memories. At the same time their are subplots involving the technicians who were conducting the process. One of them, Patrick (Elijah Wood) had entered into a relationship with Clementine and used all her memories of Joel to his advantage. Also two other technicians, Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) get stoned and party when doing the process at Joel's apartment and battle to try and erase Joel's memories whilst he was resisting.The basic themes of the film are love and memory. Whilst the film at times is a little dark the message is simple and sweet, that love is every lasting and will conquest any obstacle. At well, it looks at how the human mind works and it is a surreal place. It shows how we all want to keep memories and would want to get rid of others and try to move on in our lives.Michel Gondy paid very close attention to details. Throughout out the film when in Joel's mind you notice little things going, like the books when Clementine is working. There was also set-pieces that to be worked and with such complex ideas it took a director of real skill to handle it. Gondy and Charlie Kaufman both show that they have large imaginations to make a film like this and it was a special effort. There was a good cast in this film. Kate Winslett was particularly good and so was Tom Wilkinson (a fine actor). Jim Carrey showing that he is trying to move away from comedy roles. ESOTSM was his most serious role, but there was the odd moments of comedy. Dunst and Ruffalo were decent, Dunst could have been a little better later on. Wood seemed miscasted, he seem more wet rather then slimy.7.5 out of 10.\n",

      "Even though unfortunately this movie was not as brilliant as the other and earlier written Charlie Kaufman movie \"Being John Malkovich\" it's still a great and unique watch. Still not entirely fair that this movie always have been given more credit than \"Being John Malkovich\", fore this movie is surely not without it flaws.It above all things is a Charlie Kaufman. It's not necessarily a Michel Gondry movie, not necessarily a Jim Carrey movie, or not necessarily a Kate Winslet movie. It's a movie that really has a typical trademark Charlie Kaufman style all over it. A real accomplishment and what other movie writer can say a thing like that as well. This movie also earned Kaufman his first ever Oscar, while he already got nominated two times before in the past.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" takes you along for a ride and takes you to a strange world, in which you know more than halve of it isn't for real. It's a dream like movie but not as far off as I probably make it sound right not. It's a perfectly accessible movie for all type of audiences. Don't be alarmed or scared off by it's art-house kind of reputation. The story is at all times perfectly understandable, even though quite some strange things are happening in it.It's an unique movie for sure, that also has a unique love theme in it. It's refreshing that it doesn't handle it romantic aspects in a formulaic way, though it also needs to be said that it's also thanks to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's performances that its main story and two main characters work out so well for the movie and therefore also its romantic theme.It's again one of those roles in which Jim Carrey shows that he can really act, without trying to be or look funny all of the time. Too bad a lot of people still don't see this. The movie also features some other great and well known actors beside Carrey and Winslet, such as Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson.It's a great movie with some great movie-making tricks. It's a true visual movie, with an almost constant dream like atmosphere. A lot of old fashioned techniques are being used, which are all still better looking than modern special effects and are therefore more effective, especially for this type of movie, as well.My complaint with this movie is though that its story and the way it's progressing is quite predictable all. It's not really the story that offers the movie with its most unique or greatest moments, though the writing in general still remains great, as weird as that might sound. Hopefully you will understand what I mean by this when you watch the movie yourself.Certainly a great and also definitely unique movie to watch. Especially for the Kaufman fans.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\n",

      "Joel (Jim Carey) and Clementine's (Kate Winslet) romance comes to an abrupt end after their two-year relationship turns sour. But they haven't had a usual break-up, because Joel soon discovers that Clementine has had him erased from her memory. Devastated when he finds out, Joel decides to have Clementine erased, too only to realise too late that he doesn't want to forget her. 'Eternal sunshine' is a film that demands second-time viewing. The beginning starts at the end, when the opening credits roll 15 minutes later Joel is in a flood of tears having just discovered that Clementine has erased him. Clem and Joel's relationship is shown in broken-up memories of fierce arguments and loving moments. It follows a moral meaning about relationships and that although they have their tough moments where you wish you'd never met, you really do love them despite it all. Jim Carey's performance in this proves that he is not just a comedy actor like some people think, but can actually do really brilliant performances in serious roles. Kate Winslet was Oscar nominated for this, but it really should have been a win as she plays the impulsive, fun, emotional Clementine flawlessly. The Oscar this movie did win was best screenplay which was completely deserved because although it is extremely complicated on first-time viewing. You soon figure it all out and it all makes perfect sense. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind' cannot be missed; it is truly a masterpiece you won't forget. It is a film about relationships shown in a very different way, but despite what some people say it is not only for people who can relate, it is a film that will appeal to lots of teenagers as I have proved. A definite must-see!!!\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman has come up with what I think is his best film. He has a wicked shameless idea, and in Eternal Sunshine he sets his widgets on the board and puts them in motion. And what do they do? They hurt, they insult, they blame, and they cry. And at the end none of that changes. The pleasure in this film for me was minimal, yet holistic, which is to say Kaufman did his job. The idea behind the images is a thoughtful one and one, I believe, worth seeing played out on the big screen. What one hopes one takes from this film, in addition to the ride, is a thorough understanding where heart and mind fuse for an instant or maybe a few minutes while the film lingers in one's consciousness, is that most people walking around these days are sick, seriously sick organisms who not only want to function as normal people do, that is to say find love and happiness, but don't realize that they are sick. That's the danger to normal people, and to themselves. We can understand them, sympathize with them if you want to, but comprehend that it is only when they develop understanding regarding their problems, as the people in the film did, that they can begin to come into their own sunshine.This film is just so sad. But the message is twofold, for me anyway. The intended one by Kaufman, is that that's the way it is, and it's o.k. Another film should really start when this one ends, in which those two live their lives together, at least for a while. How would it be to look at that? Making do with sickness, co-dependency, childhood neglect, trauma , and finally finding someone who will still try to love you. Hm. Yeah. The second thing I get from it is that this is such the other side of the coin. Life is so Amazing, so beautiful, if you're healthy, of course, and can escape these travails. Unfortunately it's not a choice for everyone who finds themselves in this situation. But if your not like these people, as I am not, the best that I can do is stay away from them. They're kind of hard to spot right away, aren't they?! Especially when you're young.This movie is astounding. In a way. You have to keep closed the entire time and let it open you up in the end for you to appreciate it, and understand it. Not the way I'm use to looking at films. Sickness, Co-dependency, it's everywhere according to Kaufman, welcome to urban America! I'm watching this film and thinking the whole time, God, a bunch of sick people going through the motions of trying to find love and failing miserably. Great. And I get to watch it all...but in the end it makes sense. I was also thinking \"Post-modern smoke and mirrors,\" but, no, what this film says is that' the way it is, these are the kind of people who are around, and for me anyway, BE CAREFUL, right? Why can't you open up to this film? So much bad energy. So sad. Better to think about it. It will hit you in the end, though.\n",

      "are the ones we want to forget.Clementine Cruczynski has been cleared of all the memories she has of Joel Barish.After he learns this he goes to Dr.Howard Mierzwiak and asks him to erase Clementine from his head.During the process, while he's walking down the memory lane he wants the whole memory erasure project to be canceled.He finds out his love for Clementine is too strong.But is it too late? The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is not your typical romantic movie.It's no wonder since Charlie Kaufman was writing it.He can come up with an eccentric film like this.Michel Gondry is the director.There are some science fiction elements in this movie.That's one of the reasons this movie is as interesting as it is.Jim Carrey, who we know mostly as a comedian gives a fantastic dramatic performance as Joel.It's a little tragicomic when he goes back to being a little child in his memories and he cries.That's so heartbreaking yet amusing with his mommy and those bullies there.Kate Winslet with the changing hair color is brilliant as Clementine.Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine.Sorry, just couldn't help it but that's such a wonderful song that we also hear in this movie.The fantastic Tom Wilkinson plays Dr.Mierzwiak.Other great performances include Mark Ruffalo, who plays Stan.Elijah Wood is Patrick and Kirsten Dunst is Mary.David Cross and Jane Adams play the roles of Rob and Carrie.This is a movie I recommend for all those who are into original films.This is a movie not to forget.\n",

      "A serio-comedy about love, \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\" winds up being a lot like love itself. It's hard to explain just why it sticks with you the way it does, beyond some obvious surface charms. Unless you are one of those people who don't get it, in which case, you just need to give it another chance.A typically offbeat Charlie Kaufman script presents us with three days in the life of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a scruffy, despondent man so intimidated by life and love that he has walled himself up emotionally. On a seemingly unmotivated ride on the Long Island Railroad, he meets a woman named Clementine (Kate Winslet) whose blue-tinted hair and orange sweatshirt make her resemble the love child of Pippi Longstocking and Mr. Met. Is Clementine the one for Joel? And why can't he remember the song \"My Darling Clementine\" or Huckleberry Hound?The answers to these and other mysteries are the content of \"Eternal Sunshine\", which takes a headfirst dive into how memory and love constitute one's identity. Director Michel Gondry has a field day pulling the rug out from under the audience every five minutes, but he's working to advance the plot, not complicate it. Starting the opening credits 20 minutes in may seem pretentious, but watching it a second time, you realize how perfect a fit that is, just as you do the many other seemingly random threads woven through the fabric of the film.The richness of \"Eternal Sunshine\" can really only be appreciated on multiple viewings, but give Kaufman, Gondry, and the rest of the crew and cast credit for constructing a film that hits one the first time with enough depth, humor, and mystery to make a repeat viewing intriguing enough even to those who aren't immediately swept away. It not only becomes a clearer film the second time you watch it, but a funnier one, too, where seemingly bland lines like \"Okay\", \"Can I help you?\" and \"You think I'm nice?\" click like Legos that together make up a splendidly elaborate castle.\"Don't make any jokes about my name!\" Clementine warns Joel at the outset of the film. This is one film where Carrey is a safe bet not to do that, playing Joel as intensely low-key, alternately fascinated and repelled by Clementine's high-energy antics. It's a great performance that goes against everything you expect from Carrey, and adds to the film's wistful mood of love's bitter afterglow.There are parts of the film I still don't get, and parts I still don't like. Maybe I need to see it more than four times, but there are moments that feel extraneous. One, involving a trick Joel plays on Clementine with some ketchup, is described by Gondry in a DVD commentary as something he pulled from his own life, which shows his emotional investment in the product. David Cross can be funny, but he just seems wasted here for some weak pot jokes.Overall, this is a film that reminds me of why movies are such a touchstone of life for me. It plays the same kind of tricks as \"Momento\", but with a Preston Sturges heart that belies such shallow trickery. If you want to see a movie that sticks with one like this does, I suggest Sturges' \"The Lady Eve\". Love may be a pointless game with guaranteed heartbreak of one sort or another, but the richly humanistic \"Eternal Sunshine\" dares to make a compelling case that the game's only real losers are those who never play.\n",

      "Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) plays a shy loner in a failing relationship with Clementine (Kate Winslet), his perky and blue/orange/green-haired polar opposite (it changes throughout the film). One day, \"as a lark,\" Clementine decides to have her relationship with Joel professionally erased from her memory at a hole-in-the-wall clinic in New York City (you can find everything there). In response, Joel also decides to erase their relationship from his memory.What follows is the story of Joel and Clementine's relationship told backwards from the point of view of Joel's imagination, as he slowly begins to realize how much he cares about Clementine, and that losing his memory of her would be like losing a piece of himself as well.Every single actor in the film is outstanding; Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson all give the greatest performances I've ever seen from each of them. This is the greatest Charlie Kaufman screenplay I've ever seen. This is the greatest thing I've seen from Michael Gondry. The ending is profound and moving, and allows you to use your imagination and interpretation without being open-ended for the sake of gimmicks. The film has a classic message which can be summarized by three words (love conquers all), but is never the least bit clich√©. Instead, you are in for a totally unique and fresh experience when you watch this film. I urge you all, see it now.A masterpiece, and one of the greatest films of the decade.10/10\n",

      "I am not being biased (my forte lies in sci-fi, remember?) when I say that this is truly one of the sweetest and most powerful romantic comedies ever made, probably second to Titanic. It was romantic without being sappy (as I've said before will kill a movie) and believable without being vague (second time through, if you're confused). It's a traditional romantic comedy with a science twist. Overall, very nice.Jim Carrey's casting was no surprise to me. Why wouldn't you cast the guy who can be serious and humorous in the same sitting (if you had an answer as to why not, I ignored you)? He's truly an exceptional actor who can pull off practically any role that he's given, and that includes pulling off some pretty melodramatic lines with style. Credit be to you, Mr. Carrey. Kate Winslet is also very exceptional, known for her roles in beautifully romantic movies (think Titanic). But instead of playing the proper, upright Rose again, she's taken on Clementine: a snappy, yet surprisingly sweet, outgoing (young?) woman. And she pulled it off with brilliantly-colored hair. You always felt pity, admiration , and resent toward Clementine all at once (if that makes any sense to anyone), because of the impulsive nature of the character. Who better to play Clementine than Kate?The supporting cast all as one were exceptional (again, no bias here). Kirsten Dunst took me by surprise as Mary: the responsible, yet irresponsible, young receptionist and Lacuna technician. Quite a different step from her Bring It On role, yet she does it in stride. Elijah Wood was just as convincing playing Patrick: another irresponsible Lacuna technician, who uses Carrey's character, Joel's, memories of Clementine to seduce her. Patrick's intentions were nice, but he went about it the wrong way, and his love affair (like everyone else's in the movie, except a special case) fell apart. Mark Ruffalo, who I hadn't seen anywhere up until now (was he in any other movies besides Eternal?) played Stan: the only responsible technician, and prolific lover (of a certain girl). Whether this was Mark's first movie or not, points go to him, and all of the supporting cast as well. Credit also to the writers and directors, without whom this film would not have been possible. If you haven't seen the movie, please do. You won't be wasting any money. 9/10 hair color changes. And if you've seen this movie, there were quite a few of them. :)\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a mouthful as far as titles go, however that narrow sense confusion is intentional none the less.What then ensues is a pondering, thoughtful film between two opposites which leaves you with a sense of perspective,appreciation and quiet happiness. This film stages excitement, love, personal thoughts, bitterness, contempt and all the other emotions from a relationship that didn't go all the way. Most of all however this film focuses on reflection over time and instills optimism in one as well as a bit of regret.What you have the pleasure of observing is an uncharacteristically mature performance from Jim Carrey as Joel Barish, a shy and lovelorn thirty something with whom a sense of relation and understanding develops. Alongside Joel you find Celmentime Kruczynski who is quirky,unstable and admirably performed by Kate Winslet in a role which more than demonstrates but merely confirms her ability as a major actress.This is a people film, a life film and one that should be viewed on the basis that it has the power to change the way you perceive matters, ultimately, for the better.9/10\n",

      "I first watched it a year ago, and was very excited. Though I forgot fast, so I re watched it. This one is a movie about people, just people who are around, even more, it's about relationship between people. The idea is like: \"Every experience is useful\", even if you don't like a person and want to forget him or her, and it's important just to forgive a person, resolve problems that both of you have and start from the very beginning. I liked Carrey's role in this movie much. It's one of his \"serious\" roles, I mean he plays an ordinary guy, and not grimacing idiot like Ace Ventura. The character itself reminded me myself, like... waking up in the morning, suddenly going out somewhere for no reason, meeting someone new, falling in love with a girl who just said \"Hi\".Just nice, a little fantastic movie.\n",

      "It should not be an exaggeration if i say that kate is in her best in this movie not only for her unusual movements but also for her distinguishing hair that changes color with the sequence.I must appreciate Jim carry's role though i am not big fan of him.And above all the story teller must be given a big hand for the twist that tracks down the viewers mind to a deep thinking.Carry's running away with kate through library,kitchen,dining room --all these scenes make a feeling like i am just sitting in Joel's brain watching outside.I just can not stop thinking about this eternal sunshine not only for my favorite actress but also for that good time I have passed with this movie.\n",

      "I loved this movie. Not because of great acting or writing but because it says a lot about the world we live in. Have we as a people really turned to blocking out memories that we don't like? In my opinion it is the bad memories that define us. We all have good memories like graduation, weddings, birthdays, but those don't make us who we are. It is the memories that we wish we could forget like the deaths, and low points and how we recover from them that reflect the person we are today. And to erase a bad memory to me is like erasing a part of me that is human and real. Never the less the movie is a great love story and one of Jim Carry's best roles. enjoy.\n",

      "The eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was a great movie. When I first saw this I didn't know what it was about I just wanted to see it because Kate Winslet was in there and that it got really good reviews. Though I don't normally like Jim Carrey I thought that in this movie he really was great and he didn't act stupid like in his other movies.I loved the storyline and I'm really glad that it won the Oscar for that and it should have won the Oscar for best actress for Kate Winslet because she was extraordinary as usual for almost all her movies. There were funny parts in this movie and there were sad parts and there were shocking parts. Basically there was everything a good movie needs.The only part that i didn't enjoy as much is when it shows mark rufallo and elijah wood who are both great actors and same for kirsten dunts and tom wilkinson but I thought it was kinda boring but maybe it was just because Kate Winslet wasn't in those scenes :)Anyway, watch this movie if you like good comedy movies and romantic movies. Don't hesitate in seeing this and just watch it because you won't be disappointed.\n",

      "Jim Carrey (The Truman show) stars as Joel, a man who learns his girlfriend has had him erased from her memory. Not wanting to suffer, Joel goes in for the same procedure.Eternal Sunshine is a true romantic drama, telling a realistic and dramatic tale of relationships, through the good and the bad, and with some stunning performances, writing and direction, make a wonderful heart wrenching drama.Carrey gives one of his finest performances as Joel, a man wanting to erase his girlfriend from his memory. We saw Carrey's wonderful dramatic side in The Truman Show, and here he builds on it with a deep and moving performance as a lonely and upset man, and is brilliant alongside Oscar nominated Kate Winslet (Titanic).Winslet gives an outstanding performance as Joel's girlfriend Clementine, one of her finest on screen roles. The two have great on screen chemistry and create the necessary drama to go with a wonderful written plot.Though slightly confusing, the plot has all the right elements to justify the romantic drama genre, including a realistic portrayal of relationships, the good, the bad and the easy and the hard. The good times the pair go through, including lying on an ice pond and observing the constellations are what dreams are made of, and the accusations of nights out without your partner are what nightmares consist of, giving the film the realism required to justify the genre and the reason behind the memory being erased.The ideology of memory erasure has no doubt been in the mind of anyone who has had a truly bad relationship or experience, and the dramatic twists Eternal Sunshine gives will make you think again.Great support is given by Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), Mark Ruffalo (Zodiac) and Kirsten Dunst's (Spider-man) best ever performance.Flashbacks of Joel and Clementine's time together are directed well, with some comedic moments, including a 4 year old Joel, which is Carrey at his comedic best.The plot loses a bit of ground by jumping around at different times during the opening credits, not to mention the ending will require another watch, but is definitely worth it\n",

      "In a word - Brilliant. Michael Gondry has served up a masterpiece with \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", which has become one of my favourite love-stories of all time. The story is completely original, not adhering to the normal (yawn) boy-meets-girl formula. The plot line is audacious, the script nothing short of brilliance. Mr Gondry assumes that his audience has a brain and unlike contemporary rom-coms doesn't insult his audience with a formulaic ending either! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet carry the film, Ms Winslet in particular shining in her role as Clementine, which must surely rate as one of films most endearing female characters of all time. Similarly the supporting cast are excellent, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson all shining in their respective roles. A must-see!\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine is one of the most touching movies I've seen till date. This film explores many questions about human psychology. The basic premise is that human preferences are set very early in life and if men were to go back in time, they would most certainly choose the same things and make the same mistakes. Mr. Kaufman has weaved an extremely believable romantic story with this premise. Along the way, Mr. Kaufman also explores science fiction themes like memory erasing technology. Of course, without acting abilities of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, this movie would not have been possible.I've seen this movie several times and still want to watch it over and over again. I would rate it as the best Hollywood romantic movie.\n",

      "This movie is a real gem. People here that claim it's boring or even that it doesn't have any meaning (!) obviously didn't get the movie. And I'm not talking about the structure (which isn't that complicated by the way). I'm talking about the message it brings. Yes, inside Charlie Kaufman's head there's a crazy universe and I guess not everyone will be able to appreciate it, but that's not the point! It's not about the package, it's about what's inside. This movie shows what love is. Not the hot passion other movies often mistake it for. Real love. If you can't see that in this movie, maybe you've watched 'The Notebook' too much. So maybe you have to watch Eternal Sunshine again without worrying about the fact that Charlie Kaufman skips from future to past and back, or about the fact that you find Jim Carrey so annoying! Maybe then you'll discover the beauty of this love story. Maybe then you'll understand why so many people seem to love this movie. It makes me cry every single time I see it. So give it another shot.\n",

      "Most films about love and all that entails are wrapped up in a nice neat bow and handed to us like processed food. We know what it's made of, we waste no time in reviewing its contents; rather, we consume it and forget it within moments, hungry for something more. Such is that way of regular, made-for-morons film-making.This film is in every way a wake-up call for viewers and filmmakers alike.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are the main stars of the film. At first I was mildly curious about their characters, a little irritated with their quirks...and then they grew on me. As the film progresses---or, thanks to Kaufman's twisted sense of time and existence, regresses backwards---the characters' layers are peeled away and we see all the good and bad things about them. The nitty-gritty fights. The needless and harsh retorts. The bitchiness. The giggles. The hugs and the love.So too do we see the intricate connections between them and their surrounding characters, and the twisted tales they bring to the table only enrich the whole story.Something about this film makes me want to smile and cry at the same time. Let's just say that Kaufman's outlook on love is grounded in a world of let-downs and redemption. Is there hope? Or is ignorance truly bliss? Watch the film and I dare you not to feel enlightened afterwards. Kudos to Michel Gondry also, for although Kaufman is the voice of the film, Gondry delivers the look and feel of it all with childlike excitement and boundless abandon.\n",

      "Joel is a social inept who is unsuccessful in relationships, watching his life go by and unable to really do anything about it and being powerless to change anything, until a trip to Montauk changes everything, he meets Clementine, a scatty spontaneous and bizarre woman, and everything changes. He clicks with her on the train and you instantly feel a connection between them, you enjoy watching them, and you remember yourself the joy of these moments and how good they feel, the warmth, the affection, the sensation of a touch as you brush aside a hair, savouring a look, the delicious image of a loved one sleeping, things that stay with you, that will never leave you, no matter what happens.Skip forward to the break-up and Joel distraught in the car in pieces as it has all gone wrong for him, but at least he and Clementine have their memories, right? Wrong! In Charlie Kauffman's perfectly scripted masterpiece, people who want rid of painful memories can have them removed at Lacuna Inc, a memory erasing centre where anything can be removed, at a price. As Joel decides to exact a kind of subconscious revenge on Clementine he decides to have her removed, and as he visits the end of the relationship, we can see why. It was dead and going nowhere, so what's the point of keeping it? However as he goes back and experiences some amazing moments with Clementine we realise and remember with him, the best moments in a relationship and what they are about and how losing those is something we shouldn't do, because they are as important, in fact more so, than the bad moments that end it.In this film it explores this theme with a flawless execution, the pain he feels is not because his relationship is over, it is that the best of it cannot be added to, and how we all ultimately lose sight of what is important in relationships in today's quick fix society. That spark that starts them when they are new may die, but some of the things that replace them are more beautiful and more worthwhile. As Joel tries to fight off the memory erasers he hides in different memories and we see bizarre mixtures of different stages of his life, and the film becomes a dazzling series of clever twists and turns as he fights them in his sleep, while outside his head other battles are ongoing with the very people that are trying to erase him.The script on this film is just a joy to comprehend and the more I think about it the more in awe I am of Kauffman's handling of the subject matter. Carrey is brilliant as the put upon Joel and we don't regard him as a clown, but as a genuine, gentle, sympathetic soul who is captivated by the effervescent Clementine, played with energy and verve by the usually good value Winslet. The supporting cast headed by Kirsten Dunst, the brilliant Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are all great, but this is Carrey and Winslet's film and they shine ferociously in this joy to behold.Largely overlooked by the Oscars and splitting reviewers like a lumberjack splitting redwoods from their roots, this is gonna become one of those films that will either dazzle of drizzle, depending on who you are and where you come from, but for me, this is well worthy of its place in the top 250 and will hold strong as long as people see movies.\n",

      "This movie was not at all what I expected. I'd heard some very vague plot summaries, and what I had been able to deduce from this was \"guy and girl erase each other from their memories and then fall back in love again\" and it sounded like just another romantic comedy... Well in a sense that's the plot but it's like 10% of the whole movie.I was surprised when I realized that the majority of this movie takes place in the main character's (Joel's) mind, as he goes from memory to memory of his relationship with his girlfriend Clementine while a bunch of doctor's assistants with problems of their own are erasing the memories one by one. This part of the movie is so bizarre, and yet so moving. It provides real insight in the nature of relationships, how we so often let the bad overshadow the good, and he only realizes this before it is too late and he can do nothing to stop them. I think this movie might not be everybody's cup of tea, but I found it quite refreshing and deep.I definitely recommend that people give this quirky flick a chance.\n",

      "Right next to \"Before Sunrise\", this has to be the best movie that ever tried to explain the process of falling in love.While \"Sunrise\" does it in a chronological way, though, this one attempts to deconstruct a relationship from the ending right through the beginning, which is actually very interesting. Even though we feel we \"know\" how the movie will end, we are still willing to go along for the ride. In a way, this also mirrors \"Sunrise\" - you know that the ending will not be a happy affair, and yet you still want to live through the lives of the main characters just to find out more about what happens next.Jim Carrey, one of the greatest underrated actors ever, gives an incredible performance - I'm willing to believe many people would never believe it's him.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen... easily, a solid 10.\n",

      "An excellent film, I was waiting for Jim Carrey to do something like this..Joel is a quiet guy who doesn't relate to women very well, until he meets extrovert Clementine. Their relationship is ultimately doomed to failure, and sure enough after a couple of years they split up, and Clementine has Joel removed from her memories. Joel is so cut up about this he does the same, but half way through the process realises he doesn't want to forget her after all.The ensuing battle in Joel's mind makes for great viewing and some truly surreal moments, while the staff of the memory clinic act out their dramas in the background. The conclusion of the film is absolutely brilliant and really touching, these 2 people know exactly how their relationship is going to pan out and it's all going to end in tears, but still want to go through that process anyway.And of course there's the debate over the value of memories, that all these painful moments in our lives go towards forming us as people, and we should always hold onto them.Cannot recommend this film enough, it packs in some great cinematography, touching performances from both Carrey and Winslet and a truly original concept.My god, a romantic comedy that was actually funny!\n",

      "The chemistry between Jim Carey and Kate Winslet carries this film. It may bore some but if your in the mood to be taken on a memento type psychological journey then you are in for a treat. I came in cold in terms of the storyline, just hearing that Joel played by Jim Carey was crazy. This was great as I didn't know what to expect and that really is how the story pans out. The cinematography is depressing New York in winter and this really puts you in the mind of Joel. Watching this 4 years after is was filed, made no difference. This could be released today as still receive acclaim. I only wish there were more movies this original and executed so precisely..\n",

      "Really outstanding work by everybody. Michel Gondry has as much fun with Charlie Kaufman's scripts as Spike Jones does, but the Frenchman seems to find more poignancy in his moments. I love Jones - MALKOVICH is the best puppet movie since MARQUIS, and ADAPTATION's just about my favorite movie about movies - but there's a depth and gravity in SUNSHINE that invests Kaufman's odd world with greater humanity. This is maybe the saddest comedy I can remember.Jim Carrey manages not to ruin everything, and in fact gives a very nice, affecting, unaffected performance. Kate Winslet is delightful, the girlfriend every loner wishes would chat him up on the train. Tom Wilkinson is once again just right, simple, subtle, very funny. The crazy kids who work at the erasure shop play with giddy abandon, veining the serious tone with welcome slapstick exuberance. And Jane Adams and David Cross are just perfect as the exact friends this lummox would have.There are moments of every relationship that might be best forgotten. Or are there? How much happier would I be if I hadn't done that thing that time, or come home early that day, or heard what she said in the wrong tone of voice that night after we both should have just gone to sleep. Did we break up because of those things? Would we have broken up anyway even if we found a magic memory remover? Would it be preferable to know what's coming, to cut and run and avoid the heartbreak later - heartbreak, to anyone who's had it, is after all about as bad as it gets - or is that just living in denial of the true nature of experience? Don't ask me while my heart's still broken, because I'll surely cop out of the real deal. So am I more of a man simply because I never had the option of forgetting my great mistakes?\n",

      "Yes, like a lot of people have said, it does grown on you over time. It is a very wonderful movie. At first, i liked it, but when you think about it more and more, and see it again, it is very unique. It is nothing like other romances. It is also a science fiction movie. It's take on human relationships was really thought out. It raises questions that we today might try to answer. What will we do to lovers we hate now? What are we capable of doing? And I think, would we really want to erase our past lovers from our minds? Some of us might say we do, but keeping those memories alive, yes, even the bad ones, keep us sane. They keep us alive. That is what this movie is trying to tell us. It tells us about humans, and about two people, who we really just meet by random memories. But what memories they are too. Kate Winslet should have won the Oscar for her performance. Sometimes not too likable, sometimes quirky, sometimes funny, sometimes evil, and even heart-warming. This is also Jim Carrey's best movie to date. Wacth it. It is very entertaining too, and all the emotion and passion this little film has upon it's lessons and morals will blow you away. I think it is one of those films that deserves a special spot on the best films ever made. It truly stand on its own, and it gets more memorable as time passes...\n",

Or would love happen again when you meet the person?Saw the movie \"Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind\" on the weekend. The movie works on different levels. The presentation is a bit different, a kind of Maze which the viewer has to walk through. One interesting part of watching the movie is moving through the maze and unravelling the story. The other is the story itself. I liked the movie on both counts, but more so for the message it conveyed for me.The movie is a cool love story between an impulsive, wild, extrovert woman, Clementine and a shy, introvert man, Joel.They are in love, but hate many things about each other. One fine day, on an impulse, Clementine decides she has had enough of this and undergoes a procedure wherby she erases all memories of Joel. Joel mops around for a few days and then decides that the best way out would be to erase all memories of Clementine from his brain.The procedure starts. Joel's brain is scanned and one by one, the memories of Clementine are found and destroyed. Suddenly Joel wakes up to a level of semi-consiousness where he starts becoming aware that the memories he had treasured the most in his life are being taken away from him. He wants to stop the process but can't. Then starts a fight between Joel and the erasing machine. Joel's sub-conscious mind along with whatever is left of Clementine's memories tries to hide the memories in places which would not be reached and erased. Joel has treasured Clementine the most in his life and he is really afraid to let her go away. This part is shown very well in the movie. The way Joel tries to hide away Clementine's memories is extremely well done.Despite all efforts by Joel, Clementine's memories do get erased.He wakes up after the procedure, not remembering Clementine nor any thing related to her. On an impulse he skips work and goes to the beach, where he meets ¬Ö",

      "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind - directed by Michel Gondry with Kate Winslet (as Clementine Kruczynski) and Jim Carrey (as Joel Barish) is a kind of food for thought.Joel and Clementine met each other at a beach. They got together but then found so many conflictions that they broke up. Clementine decided to hire a doctor to erase Joel from her memory with modern technology. Finding out the truth, Joel decided to do the same thing. This, although \"technically is brain damage\", the effect is no more than a night of heavy drinking. During the process, Joel changed his mind and tried to keep the memories of Clem but he did not succeed. Soon later, Joel and Clem met each other again without remembering any thing about the past.

      " The movie is kind of boring for those who love action or thriller. There is almost no sexually hot scene or violence. Actually, it should not be too quick so that viewers can understand the plot. It has its own way to tense our nerves. The movie has a little bit of science-fiction with brain-erasing technology and a little bit of fantasy where memories and thoughts are mixed up, where one can go into his own mind and try to control it. It is full of surprises and keeps the viewers on wondering. The characters' feelings are very real.The director is really good in his \"reverse-chronologic\" time sequence. Memories come back piece by piece, with the last ¬ñ the most terrible one ¬ñ comes first and those more beautiful come later and so Joel realises how great they were, and he finally wants to keep them.The main actor and actress are completely a new version of themselves. Jim Carrey really did a \"serious movie\" and Kate Winslet was so great as an \"impulsive\" woman with changing hair colour time after time.There was a line in \"Before sunset\" that \"Memories are good if we don't have to deal with the past\". Sometimes, memories are not so good and we want to erase them. We want to forget things that used to make us happy but are causing us troubles. Yet, memories are a part of life. You may try to erase it, even though by means of machines and technologies, they will eventually come back and the result is painful.People want to erase the bad memories but keep the good ones.

      "Purchased this at the recent Big W sale, and rewatched Fri night with wifey. Wasn't expecting here to like much. She fell asleep about half way through, and she didn't seem to disappointed.\"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\" tells the story of a love affair between Joel (Jim Carrey, in one of his few non-annoying roles) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). The relationship eventually becomes very intense and after one big fight ends in Clementine checking herself in to have their relationship erased from her mind. Distraught, Joel decides to do likewise. During Joel's procedure we begin to piece together the two characters and the dynamics of their relationship.Very hard movie to explain, but worth seeing. Great cast, led by the fore-mentioned as well as Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood. The major feature of the movie though is the directing job done by Michel Gondry, which is groundbreaking. Most of his amazing work is done in the memories of Joel, and he tries lots of different things, all of which are brilliant. Amazingly he's done little else of note in Hollywood, mostly video clips including Bjork's \"Human Behaviour\" and Massive Attack's \"Protection\".Must see.\n",

But this has to be the pick of the crop and it is very, very unlikely that any other will come close to approaching the quality of this version in the future.The acting is truly perfect and I was - frankly - gobsmacked at how well someone like Jim Carrey who comes across as a bumbling ninny was able to do this sot of thing so well. Carrey, if it was your goal to make the switch from humour to \"serious\" acting, congratulations; you did in one movie what many others in your shoes have been utterly incapable of doing in a lifetime.Kate Winslets performance is - as ever - spot on. A very talented individual indeed.Its impossible to explain any of the plot without spoling so I'll leave the reader with this: Just go see it. If you \"dont get it\", I feel sorry for you.\n",

      "This is a movie about modern relationships. Joel Barish (Carrey) meets a messed up girl who turns his world around and then they break up. However in this world the break ups can be made permanent by having your memory wiped of that person.This speaks volumes about the weakness of the modern human. People are rapidly becoming pale superficial material empty self-serving sociopath mannequins of what humans once were. Once upon a time character mattered; today it is laughed at.This movie's answer to the question: \"do you want who you are and the experiences that have made you, erased?\" is indefatigably \"YES!\" If we can have anything we want, and the thought of removing painful memories from our lives is considered a blessing, then we are no longer humans - just \"evolved\" neurological impulses.This movie is not about relationships. In essence it is about people's own inability to be human. They refuse to live life with painful memories -in essence they refuse to live. They want fast food memories and that's OK. I use to think zombies didn't exist... nonetheless it is well done. 8/10-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/PS: the Bible says that in the end, people will be lovers of themselves, but with no love in them.

According to story of film, Joel and Clementine meet nearby a coast coincidentally. By the time, their relation goes forward and comes to the point that is end.

      "This is a very innovative and memorable story, the kind of movie that's even more enjoyable the second time around. On the first viewing, the \"construction-by-apparent-lack-of-construction\" technique has the viewer trying to take it all in, as the director flashes wild and divergent images. It's almost as if he's challenging you to keep up, but you soon learn there's method to the madness.Jim Carrey (as Joel) and Kate Winslett (as Clementine) are definitely the strengths driving the movie; Winslett plays against type as a snotty, self absorbed, impulsive iconoclast who spends her time continuously changing her hair color. Winslett makes this very imperfect character somehow vulnerable and ultimately sympathetic. Carrey navigates his sometimes comedic, sometimes tragic Joel character magnificently. The memory/dream sequences are the best moments. Although they appear mish-mosh in design, these cuts reflect very well how dreams manifest themselves. The editing is brilliantly executed to demonstrate where one memory ends and another begins, where one is an actual remembered event, and where another is Joel's intentional thought.However, the fine production is marred by some problems. The director indulges himself in erratic jiggling and panning camera work frivolity. This method is effective if used in moderation, and restricted to dream sequences, but it's used here repetitiously, so the director can scream at you from behind the camera about how clever he is. It's distracting, irritating, and artistically useless.The subplots about the irresponsible technicians who perform the procedure are pointless and stupid. Even in a fantasy story like this, these characters just don't fit. These idiots are not interesting to look at, and really add nothing to the message of the story already accomplished by the main characters. The acting in these segments by Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Cate Blanchett (all normally good actors) is the lousiest I've seen from any of them, but Wood's emo twerp performance is by far the worst. He looked like a stuffed voodoo doll with loose bulging eyes that might pop out of its head any minute. His lines sound like they're coming from a broken CD player inside his nose.Concentrate on the main story and work of the principal actors, and this is a superior movie which will inspire you to think about it afterwards, and worth watching.\n",

      "A lot of movies get made everyday, but only a few really affect us. One such movie is ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. This film had such a huge impact on the audience and critics alike when it came out in the year 2004. Not just because of its story with a non-linear time-line, but also due to the fact that it is a warm-hearted original love story, and an unusual one at that. Taken from the lines of Alexander Pope's poem \" Eloisa to Abelard,\" the title of this film is pretty intriguing. The movie begins with Joel Barish, played wonderfully by Jim Carrey, taking a train to Montauk, where he meets Clementine Kruczynski, who, is played by the beautiful and talented Kate Winslet. What is interesting about this film from the very beginning is that one realizes how different these characters are. These are characters that we would never associate these actors with. Who would have ever thought of Jim to be this dull, self-absorbed, shy guy, who always looked as if he were lost? And never in one's dream would one think of Kate as this feisty, impulsive woman, who is not only not one of those \"nice people,\" but someone who is looking for her own peace of mind. The film revolves around its tag-line, \"You can erase someone from your mind. Getting them out of your heart is another story!\" If this interestingly bizarre story-line is not enough to draw you into watching this movie, the huge star power could. Along with Jim and Kate, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson star in it.The technical aspects of the film are amazing. Though there are no major \"character\" creation needs, there are intricate details that add to the aesthetic beauty of the film. Small effects like the books disappearing in the bookshop need a special mention. The original song \"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime,\" is so very apt for the film. Beck has done a great job singing it. Jon Brion's score deserves a mention. And watch out for the two Hindi songs in the film! Kate Winslet is a delight to watch! With her beautiful self and her \"colorful\" hair! \"Blue Ruin\" goes so well with her. More importantly, this woman can act! She has, yet again, proved herself to not only being a pretty face with this difficult-to-perform role of a careless, unpredictable, adventurous woman. Jim Carrey is so full of life though his character lacks the basic joy of living in the film. He acts with great sensitivity and warmth banishing all the doubts that people have about whether he can really act! His presence is strongly felt. Michel Gondry, the director, had a very difficult job to do. With the plot getting more and more intricate by the minute, it is really a tough task to bring the movie home, which, by the way, he does beautifully! Most of the soul of the movie comes from its screenplay. The genius responsible for it is Charlie Kaufman. His style of handling surrealism is incredible. He has handled it earlier in his \"Being John Malkovich.\" The eccentricity of this story, which is Kaufman's trademark, once again works excellently. His style of inter-weaving the various plots and giving them the needed history at the right points makes him eligible for the Oscar that he received. Michel Gondry, Charlie Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth, the writers, have made sure that the movie does not seem dry. They have written the story and the dialog, adding all the necessary elements to keep it more alive. Kaufman has also incorporated novel elements like in the train scene, the music is not played to fill up the gap during the silence between Joel and Clementine but is instead played when Joel and Clem talk and is paused when they pause. None of this goes unnoticed. This happened to increase the tension of the scene and their goal is achieved.The scenes like \"Honey Moon on Ice\" and the one where Joel goes to Clementine's, give the movie a romantic feel-good effect. Lines like, Joel: Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating Clementine: Are you NUTS? Joel: It's been suggested. Joel: Valentine's Day is a holiday invented by greeting card companies to make people feel like crap Joel: Are we like couples you see in restaurants? Are we the dining dead? Joel: Sand is overrated. It's just tiny, little rocks -give us the feel of a film with dark, play-with-words sort of humor, unlike the usual ones of Jim Carry where, it is more of the slapstick kind. Equally, some lines just make us go \"awww!\" for they are really adorable. The plot with Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo and Kisten Dunst compensate for the drama in the movie. And all the gadgets and instruments with fantasy and the surrealistic elements prove it to being a science fiction. This is a perfect mix of romance, comedy, drama and science fiction! Though it is colorful and flamboyant, it still ends up being so fragile and sensitive. Now that's rare! Surrealism could never feel this good! It is not one bit disturbing in the negative sense. The film makes so much sense to you that you find it hard to stop thinking about it for days. A must-see for sure! For the story, the direction, the screenplay, the actors and for the well deserved Oscar! You'll want to see this film more than once! :)\n",

      "Who you are is shaped from what you've seen, what you've experienced, what you've felt, and what you've learned; getting rid of any portion of the past diminishes a part of you, it strips away a piece of you. Gondry's film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind explores love in a different way; what happens when its over, and you want to move on by destroying what had happened before. Can somebody continue living life after forgetting events that had occurred to him or her years ago? This concept is very unique, quite bizarre, but is handled so perfectly it speaks to the soul, becomes food for thought, and is a blessing disguised in 108 minutes of deep, insightful popcorn entertainment. Flawlessly written by Kaufman and Gondry, wonderfully acted by Carrey and Winslet, and beautifully directed by Gondry, Eternal Sunshine is a bittersweet movie that should bring out tears of joy and despair in anyone that has been through the highs and lows of love.Eternal Sunshine follows a quiet, tightly wounded, almost emotionless man by the name of Joel (Jim Carrey) whom just learned that his ex-girlfriend, the carefree, impulsive, unpredictable, and needy Clementine (Kate Winslet) erased him from her memory using a special procedure. In retaliation, Joel attempts to undergo the same procedure, to destroy any living evidence of a relationship. However, as the procedure is underway and Joel is running around through the memories inside his head, he realizes just how much he still loves her and how empty he would become if the woman that turned his life around suddenly vanishes. In his mind he races to save any shred of memory of Clementine, despite the doctors successfully dismantling his mind at the same time. In the meantime, not all is well amongst the people involved with the procedure, as the memory-erasing business impacted their morals, their beliefs about love, and their sympathy towards people in general.The movie is displayed in a very unstructured manner, which pretty much represents the hostile timeframe of recollections. Eternal Sunshine is displayed in a totally non-linear format, and repeatedly jumps settings with little or no warning whatsoever. That aspect alone requires multiple viewings of this film just to see how genius the directing and editing really is. The writing staff delivers one of the most original love tales in recent memory (pun intended), as they craft a deep story about a bond between two people that love and need each other, whether they know it or not. Every line, every bit of dialogue is important and strengthens the belief that Joel and Clementine were meant for each other.Complimenting the writing is the excellent direction of Goundry. While the visual effects were stunning, the story propels the movie instead of the imagery, which is a rarity. Goundry doesn't just film, he films and then edits severely using a montage of colors, blurs, textures, angles, and also alternates with different speeds throughout the entire movie to set the tone and mood of the moment. His music videos aren't as great as critics claim (Personally, Spike Jonze destroys him) but all his usual music video techniques shine brilliantly in this film. Clever editing (that should have at least gotten an Oscar nod) helps display the chaos towards the climax in the movie.Finally however, we have to give a special congratulations to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet for providing yet another great performance as the main couple in the movie. You saw them at their happiest, their saddest, their angriest, and at their most caring. Both actors have a nice range of roles in their resume, but ranking high up there in terms of performances are the ones here. Supporting cast is very good too, especially by that of Kirsten Dunst as the adorable employee of the morally questionable company behind the memory-erasing procedure.For being a sci-fi movie, this plays off as incredibly believable, partly because it never goes over-the-top. The erasing process was never dwelled upon nor was it totally explained as to how it works and how its possible, but raises a lot of moral questions long after the movie is over. How much would someone change after taking away a special person from their life? Even when the sun settles and it's all over, can the love still remain? Can the love still be there? Eternal Sunshine raises so many questions and leaves so much room for discussion, that it can become an event in itself to discuss the movie after watching it.Bottom Line: With excellent acting, directing, editing, and visuals backing a unique yet engrossing story about love, memories, and all the hardships and happiness it brings, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is easily one of the best films of 2004. While the concept and the presentation of the movie may distract and even drive away the avid moviegoer, underneath the complexities of some of the scenes lies a very basic theme about moving on: You can move on, try to forget, but the love for that person remains, forever and always, and so will the memories, whether you like it or not. Just watch it, whether you are alone, with somebody, or more than one person (in which case, shame on you). But can a spotless mind be a happy mind? Not sure but a spotless film like this one is hard to catch, so whenever you have the chance to see it, take it.\n",

      "ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND***** stars out of 5 (10/10).\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is one of the best romance movies ever made. The film is intriguing, intelligent, and wonderful.Joel Barish (JIM CARREY) has had a bad ending to a wonderful relationship with Clementine Kruczynski (KATE WINSLET). After learning of a facility that is able to depress memories in certain parts of the brain, he determines that it's best to wipe all knowledge of Clementine from his head. Besides, she had the same operation done about Joel, and what better to wipe all and any memory of their time together from the face of the earth. While the operation is underway and Joel unconscious, he quickly revisits those memories of time spent with Clementine. He realizes that some memories are best not forgotten, and he tries to find a way to savor the last moments and events of their love that he can.When the credits roll, you can't help but understand one thing; this is a beautifully crafted piece of art. It is moving, deep, and emotionally real. It digs beneath our skin, and reminds us why our memories are big part of our life. The film is mislabeled as a romantic/comedy. Yes, there are a few smiles, but this movie is a drama and make no mistake about it. It can be very sad, but it's not without hope. Jim Carrey gives the best performance of his career, one I can only describe as a breakthrough. Kate Winslet is the best actress of her generation, and continues her roll of great work. There are also powerful performances from ELIJAH WOOD, TOM WILKINSON, MARK RUFFALO, and KIRSTEN DUNST. The screenplay is flawless, the direction superb, and the performances poignant. It is a great movie anyway you turn it. It is an amazing vision from beginning to end.Yes, the movie can be strange, but you don't realize until you get up from your seat. The film is so absorbing that you forget about the strange or the unreal. A movie with that kind of ability has some power to it. While there will be people this isn't the film for, I would find it hard to believe if you came out of this wonderful exhibit of talent unsatisfied. Simply put, this is a brilliant film.\n",

The jury's out, but not terrible, merely average I think.The ending was pretty lame; it was rather obvious from the start what was going to happen, just to what degree.Definitely not worthy of the IMDb top 50, but also definitely worthy of a look.

How is he still in the movie thereafter?\"...this is an untrue fact as he didn't kill himself/slit his throat he was trying to get Clementine's attention and therefore was a joke.anyway...the best film of mine by far...watch out for the science of sleep DVD as well.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine... seems to be one of those films that really divides its audience. (In fact, I think's it's only behind Napoleon Dynamite as a film which inspires such devotion or dislike in equal measure).I personally love the film. I think it's a inspired concept, excellently handled and visually stunning - and a welcome break from all the saccharine Sleepless in Seattle-style romantic comedies that clog the market.I think it is one of the most genuinely moving love stories of this oh-so-cynical age. It portrays modern relationships for what they are: turbulent, destructive, and by no means easy - filled with neuroses and obstacles, but ultimately the most intoxicating and enjoyable experiences life can throw in your path.It shows that romance isn't in dull plot contrivance; in a race to catch your true love before their train leaves the station; in a mysterious romantic note found in a bottle, etc. Love is found in the little moments shared by two people, the memories that are known only to its participants.The film is also the best example of the human mind imagined as a landscape that I can think of.\n",

      "The photography in this film was beautiful. Surrealistic scenes reminiscent of a Fellini film. Carey was brilliant as ever as a depressed lover who can't seem to be able to pay enough attention or have enough say-so in how his relations are going. Enter a new concept, have your memory of a relationship erased at a clinic. While the main character's memory is being erased, he ponders over all the mistakes and sagas of his relationship that failed. By the end, you realize that Carey and his lost lover (Winslet) really did find a niche with each other - and is knowing that every relation may end, but that shouldn't stop you from trying. The main flaw of the movie is that it sounds like an idea tried out on the old Twilight Zone. I will need to look into this. The movie seems a bit too formulaic, and expects us to be in constant awe that one's memory can be erased through a computer program.\n",

      "If I was being honest, I was never really that excited when I heard about Eternal Sunshine. Can you blame for it had Kate Winslet within it who I considered to be overrated, and Jim Carey who was playing a character exactly the opposite of his usual characters. So thank god when I saw if a shop for only ¬£3.99, I brought it.Immediately when I started watching the film, it washed over me. Kate Winslets performance was mind boggling as Clemantine, and Jim Carey fitted in well a the shy Joel. Not to mention some excellent performances from Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood.But I don't think that all the credit should go to the actors, as it is the script, perfectly written bu Charlie Kaufmann and the great directional sense of Michel Gondry that made this film one of the best i have ever seen. What I like about Eternal Sunshine, is that all the shots are tricks of the camera, and not mindless blue screen. Forced Perspective was used often here. It feels like a piece of art rather than a mindless special effects blockbuster.I did have to watch the movie twice to understand it completely. Just part of the brilliance of Kaufmann's script. If your considering watching this movie, then I'm telling you its far better than it sounds. Joel and Clemantine make a much better movie couple then Rose and Jack Dawson.\n",

From the very first scene: a lonely Carrey riding a train; to the last, you are thrown into a tale that tears at your heart and challenges your brain in tender but heartbreaking ways. The visual effects are phenomenal, my personal favorite of an entire house decomposing in the matter of seconds, just as the memory is. Carrey, Kate Winslet, and the rest of the cast melt into the characters, embracing their attributes as if born to them. When the last scene fades to the credits, you'll be speechless at the film you just witnessed.\n",

      "A brilliant film...and, oddly, one of the most romantic (that I can *recall*!!! ;~) that I can recall...oh, I think I wrote that, already. Deja vu all over again!There are too many posts for me to examine here, but has anyone commented on the great, metaphorical & archetypical use of the elephants during the long Act II memory wipe-out portion of this wonderful film???Apparently during filming, the crew just happened to come across the annual Barnum & Bailey Circus parade in NYC, and thought that an impromptu shooting during this unscripted spectacle might lend a good sort of trippiness to the non-linear memory/experience process.Of course, as most folks know around the world, elephants, those lovable long-lived pachyderms, also are associated metaphorically as having extremely long memories...\"Elephants never forget\" is the common maxim. This belief has actually been studied & supported so:http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1285532.stm...so, kudos to Michel Gondry, et crew, for \"Focus\"ing on the elephants during this impromptu circus shoot. It would be interesting to find out if the editors realized this neat metaphorical convergence (elephants=memory), or if it was just just dumb-luck, realized post hoc by Yours Truly (&, I'm sure, at least a few others).\n",

      "When I first sat down and started this one at home I did not know what to expect. The great reviews puzzled me, because I had the impression that this was just another feel-good drama movie like so many other average movies. This turned out to be completely wrong, it was deep, honest, touching and uplifting. This movie represents the wish for a chance either to forget the mistakes of the past, or to turn things right again and give it one more chance. This wishful thinking is not at all sugar sweet as one could imagine, but it is deep, realistic and surprising. You do not know what is going to happen, and you sit there and suffer with the characters throughout the movie, just hoping that things will turn out OK. The ending really gets to you and was for me quite surprising in its own way. The actors deliver an astonishing performance each of them, most of all the comedy-guru Jim Carrey, which I would have thought could not be taken that seriously. Kate Winslet basically just nails it spot-on and the rest of the crew (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and so on.) gives the movie life and content outside the main-characters lives too. The movie is from start to finish puzzling, dramatic and for many confusing. The composing of the movie and the use of time and special effects gives this movie the last extra spice. All in all a movie of top quality with everything this kind of movie needs and also some original adds from the creative and enthusiastic director. 8.5 / 10\n",

      "'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is one of those movies that I thought about seeing, half wanted to see, but never did see until now. I'm very glad I finally did.From the first scene in the movie to the last, you're constantly sitting there wondering, \"What the hell?\" It's an extremely bizarre movie, completely unlike any other I've seen before. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have outstanding chemistry, and though drama generally isn't Carrey's forte, he pulls it off big time here.Beginning to end, this film will make you laugh, cry, frown, squint, and wonder what the heck is going on. But you'll enjoy every minute of it.\n",

      "I found this movie very interesting. Gondry did a very good job of weaving the relationships between the characters involved. I originally did not want to see this movie because I didn't think Jim Carrey was very good in more serious roles, but after watching it I must say that he did an exceptional job. All the characters cast for this movie fit their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood were especially good. I really like these type of comedies, ones with a smarter outlook on comedy. This isn't a movie that any idiot can pick up and watch. The humor is very witty and takes intelligence to find it funny. I really like movies like that. All in all, I would recommend this movie to any intelligent human being who can understand smart humor.\n",

      "Let me get this off my chest: this movie is NOT perfect. It starts off with a lot of stuff that seems more at home in a pretentious film school project than a Charlie Kaufman flick. I didn't know it was the great Kaufman who had written the script, and for the first 15 minutes or so, I sat there wondering if the writer and director were George Lucas' kids or something, given a bunch of money to make a big-name vanity movie, a la \"The Brown Bunny\".Well, if I were to watch the movie again now, I'd understand that vague beginning, because the film really IS beautifully crafted, heartwarming and true to the concepts of love. But it takes a while to get that. Compared to the other Kaufman flicks I've seen (Human Nature, Being John Malkovich) it fails in that respect: it doesn't convince me that the wackiness is worth it from the get-go. I could have turned this movie off in annoyance that the movie was trying to hide Elijah Wood from me so ineptly (when in fact, I DIDN'T know what the movie was trying to hide after all). I would have missed a good movie experience.\n",

      "First, it's important to make clear the correct plot where a couple is trying to erase each others record from their memories but they keep finding each other every time and falling inlove, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, or falling inlove, a simile.While you see the movie the story goes parallel to the thinking process. Complex at first and enlightening most of the time the picture combines memory, soul and virtue and all the complex heritage of growing up in family. It lets the viewer take the movie out of the screen and leave the cinema with the movie.Carrey delivers a superb performance that made him avoid the \"Oscar\". His humor mixed with sadness and all the complexity of the character made me understand that he is a great actor (before, Truman Show made the audience give a serious look at this actor) and performer.Kate Winslet, again, delivers a full featured character, a \"girl\" from town, this \"Shakespeare\" actress can do it all.The supporting roles are excellent, specially with a shiny Kirsten Dunst that returns to her kinky yet insightful characters.A great insightful crazy and round film that has to be watched several times.\n",

      "When i first heard of this film it didn't interest me that much, other than it had Jim Carrey in it, and i usually watch his films because i get a good laugh. But this film didn't need his classic comedy to make it great, it had his ability to put himself into any situation and make it seem real, that is what makes it work so well.I only decided to watch this film because i am studying philosophy and i am very interested in the mind-body relationship and how it is dealt with by different people.In this film, Joel (Jim Carey) has part of his memories erased. He has this done because his relationship ended with the woman he was in love with. He didn't want to have all those wonderful memories of her and not have her, so he wants them erased. I'm sure many people have wanted this to be done to them, their memories, of all these great things that you can't have and don't want to be reminded of anymore because you can't have them, erased. It would surely make life easier, or would it? This film doesn't completely explore what would happen if you had your memories erased but it explores what might happen if they were being erased. The vision of the writers/directors of this film really helped the viewer understand what was going on. The memory literally being erased, and Joel not wanting that memory to be erased and running from it like one would from a fear. The idea of hiding in another memory is such a great idea, and it shows that Joel starts to realise that it is not just a memory that is being erased from him, it is part of him that is being erased. He is running from the choice he made.Turning to the argument between physicalists and dualists. This film seems to suggest that the mind, our memories, are held somewhere in the brain, as this is where the \"Doctors\" are locating and erasing the memories from. But the problem with this is that you cannot open Joel's brain and find Joel, he is not in there as we are shown he is. But one might say that what we are seeing is a representation of what he is remembering, but the counter-argument to that is that when you remember something don't you see an image, smell a smell, hear a sound, etc? Where is this platform that this memory is being played out on? Maybe Dr Howard (Tom Wilkinson) locates the memory through the brain and is able to erase from the mind in this way, but this means he has reached some understanding of what the mind is and it would be very helpful if he shared that with the rest of us who are struggling to figure it out, hehe.Maybe he hasn't figured out what the mind is, and maybe he doesn't erase the memories from the mind because he makes the point that all items and objects that could remind Joel of his relationship to be taken away so his memories don't come back. Clementine (Kate Winslet) has this experience of familiar experiences when Patrick (Elijah Wood) (who has taken advantage of her situation to start dating her and using Joel's objects to get know her prior and thus her liking him) and starts to get de-ja-vu. Could this mean our memories are held in our brains and minds? When we erase it from one area we might be able to access from the other by familiarity. This seems like a valid argument for the movie as Joel and Clementine do seem to recognise something in each other after their memories are erased but it only comes clear when Mary (Kirsten Dunst) reveals it to them.This is a sweet, dark, joyful, philosophical movie to watch and i recommend it to anyone.Jim Carrey's performance is en-capturing and Kate Winslet portrays a vibrant young person very well.\n",
      "1160\n",
      "I'm glad to see Jim Carrey doing something that is serious. Not that his other movies has been stupid, bad or not serious, i mean.He's a great comedian, he's a funny guy, but every movie that includes him being crazy and out of his mind is always the same, the same faces, sounds, gestures.It must have been challenging for him to play Joel Barrish, and he did it really well, i was stunned at first. Kate Winslet is also great, they're both great.this movies was great, probably on of the best 10 movies i've ever seen in my entire life.\n",

      "This movie is absolutely phenomenal. Charlie Kaufman's an absolute genius. This movie is the perfect example of thinking before you act, blown up to the worst case scenario. The writing is phenomenal and despite the fantasy plot details (mind erasing), seems extremely real. The entire cast is great but Mark Ruffalo and Jim Carrey really stand out for me. Carrey takes on a different type of character than The Mask or Ace Ventura (so if you like the crazy Carrey movies, rather than The Truman Show or The Cable Guy avoid this one), his character is deep and very realistic. You may be confused if you watch it once, but after a second time, both the plot and the themes make more sense. This film blends weirdness, comedy, tragedy and reality. If you liked this movie, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation are others like it.\n",

Winslett is her usual self, good in a supporting role.It just made me smile an awful lot and such a genius storyline well skirted. Why isn't this rolling in awards? I would like to know please. Carrey alone should have at least been nominated for best leading man Oscar.It's official. Great film, no, amazing film and anyone who dislikes it receives a free smack in the mouth\n",

In this movie it doesn't matter if you don't view it since the beginning cause its so fluent that you can get the idea right in every instant of the film, excellent film. I'd like to dye my hair like Clementine, I wonder if Kate Winslet's hair turn out like crap after the shot of the movie, blue,green,red and blond...well she really is something. I loved little Joel, and when they bathed in the sink. The photography is swell, the screen play speaks for itself. Great job, great film, great cast, the snow and the music played a beautiful complement to the story.\n",

      "This film is in my opinion one of the best I have ever seen or will see within my lifetime. I was recommend to see this by a friend and at first I had trepidations about Jim Carreys ability to act comfortably and well within a serious role, this assumption was completely wrong.The acting by the lead Jim Carrey and his opposite Kate Winslet was strong, warm, compassionate and made me forget I was watching a written film with actors in it. Both cast members made me care for the characters they were playing in such a way that I have not felt while watching any other film. Their performance was believable and made me feel as though I wanted to help them in any way I could, the chemistry on camera was perfect and the film was one of the best I have seen.The only negative was that when I was watching I would look at Elijah Wood's character and Kirsten Dunst's and feel as though was just watching them talk and act, I did not feel much for their characters or feel that their roles were fluently acted. Saying this however I should say that the roles they had to play were complex roles and possibly within the future they could easily perform better in a similar situation once they have gained a little more experience.The interlocking nature of every character within this well thought out and planned film was great and it was a hugely enjoyable experience. The film makes you think about if you were to have your memories of ones you love taken and you feel deeply entangled within the idea of the film yourself.This is an amazing film and well worth watching whenever you get the chance.\n",

      "Ingrates that we are, we've probably grown unappreciatively accustomed to Charlie Kaufman's mind game comedies of late. Certainly there's more than a echo of the tone set by Being John Malkovich here. But what separates Eternal Sunshine is that it is no mere flight of fantasy, no mere intellectual plaything of a film. It's a stonking great moving, emotional, true, hilarious, joyful success of a film, with nary a hair out of place in its dissection of memory, love, motivation and life. It distills and dissects every corner and corridor of the question it asks itself with precision, purity and pleasure whilst never over egging the pudding. It always finds exactly the right direction to go in at exactly the right time and constantly entertains the audience. It's been a few years since I've seen a film where I not only don't know how it will end, but am actually keen to find out. The ending didn't disappoint. This will find its way into my DVD collection very, very quickly.\n",
      "1166\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine is a film based around an intriguing premise; you receive a note that states that someone has had you erased from their memory. Writer Charlie Kaufman is drawn to such ideas, both high concept and surreal in equal measure. Yet his characters are always grounded with the possession of recognisable human qualities the like of which are rarely so honestly portrayed in modern cinema. In Being John Malkovich his characters take the unlikely solution of a door into the mind of the titular actor in order to literally escape from themselves, having been provided with the opportunity to become somebody else completely. In Eternal Sunshine, Kaufman's creations are again attempting to escape, this time from the painful memories of a failed love affair.When he discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslett) has used the services of Lacuna Inc in order to erase the painful memories she associates with him, Joel (Jim Carrey) decides to undergo the same procedure. As the specialists track the unconscious Joel through his memories of Clementine, methodically erasing any recollection he has of her, he is somehow conscious of what is happening. The process begins with the memories most recent, arguments the couple had as their relationship broke down. As time passes in reverse, and Joes recalls happier times, he beings to realise that he wants to hold on to these memories, without which he will lose Clementine forever.Thus begins the unusual and imaginative centre of the film, as the two protagonists are chased through Joel's memories as he desperately tries to retain his recollections of Clementine. These sequences are unnerving, as the idea that someone could literally 'steal' you memory should be. They are also quite creative, rarely using computer effects when clever camera work would suffice.In one of the funnier sequences, Carrey realises that in order to hide his memories of Winslett, he must take her into a part of his mind where she does not belong. He chooses a painful memory (aren't these always the ones we remember?) where a group of young boys goad him into hitting a dead bird with a stick. This is shot partially with a young stunt double for Carrey and partially with the man himself, dressed as a six year old. Yet director Michel Gondry is not afraid to switch to a full size Carrey, who makes to attack one of the young Bullies, only to be taken down by the kid with a painful looking arm lock. Whilst the effect and design of the film often appear rough around the edges, the combination of solid central performances and a clever script keep the audience engaged with the characters.The memories which Carrey experiences are believable as a selection of recalled events from a love affair; moments of intimacy, infuriating arguments and conversations and occasions which were seemingly insignificant at the time. These are real characters with personality flaws that ring true. Joel may be a little dull and overly dependent on his partner, and Clementine is certainly insecure and incapable of commitment. As we learn about their relationship it becomes apparent that whilst they are neither flawless nor ideal for one another, that life was never meant to be easy and perhaps we have to accept the bad with the good.\n",
      "1167\n",
      "Bizarre, alternative, tragic, beautiful; the list of adjectives could go on forever when it comes to describing the look and feel of Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind. The film is definitely all of these things but there are some faults hidden within the puzzle that is inside Jim Carrey's mind, or in his character's, at least.Overall, I like the use of the hand held camera and the disorientating use of jump cuts in the editing reminds me of some films from the 'French New Wave', especially the ones with the romance theme. This is all there from the starting blocks and the simplistic settings and exchanges of dialogue very early on work with these techniques well. The train is an ideal, romantic first setting and there's enough build up in the first ten minutes to warrant the reaction we'll feel later on when everything starts to go wrong. Interestingly enough, these jump cuts start to get more frequent just as we begin to suspect something here isn't quite right.The dialogue is clever as it hints at things to come, as well as staying neutral, harmless 'getting to know you' banter. An example is when the 'girl' seems to recognise him and asks if they've met before. Our hero dismisses it as a chance encounter at the book shop maybe. This is clever as if you notice this line; there will be more of an impact later on in the film. Good script and good story work, here.As the film wears on, there is a distinct element of eeriness. This is shown through flashbacks, although they're flashbacks with a twist as Carrey's character (Joel) is apparently 'witnessing his own memories.' Imagine what it would be like to stand next to yourself, invisible of course, in an old memory and witness it all over again. This is what happens throughout this film and there is certainly a touch of what 'Being John Malkovich' was like in the final fifteen minutes or so was like, only this time ¬ñ it's almost throughout. What's also good about these eerie moments is that some of them have a comic touch to them, whereas some will genuinely make you shiver. This is a good juxtaposition to have flowing throughout.As well as this, there are many 'little things' to watch out for. Some examples include the changing colour of Clementine's (Winslet) hair, the disappearing backgrounds and things that were there before that aren't there now or have changed. This is why the film has such an alluring feel to want to go back and see again, but some other scenes involving other characters seem strangely out of place. Anything that's happening to people in the real world, outside of Joel's mind just seems pointless and the scenes are random and unfunny. Joel and Clementine are the main focus, not Dunst and Wilkinson's characters whom have their own miniature side story twist.However, with a strong and powerful ending (in his psyche, at least) and good, serious acting all round feeding off a good script and zany concepts ¬ñ Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a good film.\n",

      "Darkness piled upon darkness, steeped in disturbing dissonance; a glutting, suffocating despair; a stultifying of the spirit and a crippling of the ego. No way out, no way out¬Ö",
      " no, not the movie ¬ñ my last relationship.*Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind* opens with a disoriented Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) wondering how he sustained a giant gash along the side of his car. From there, through flashbacks and flash-forwards, we gradually unveil the depressing reality that is his life ¬ñ and how his last relationship was a promise of respite from despair, but ended up merely presaging a different species of despair.After his relationship has acrimoniously soured with his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet, even more irritating than she was in *Titanic* - if that's possible), Joel discovers, through mutual friends, that she has had a scientific procedure performed that erases selective memories; while some may contend that Kate Winslet has always been walking around with a blank brain, in this case, she has just erased memories of her relationship with Joel. In a fit of righteous wrath, Joel enlists Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson - whose description of this implausible procedure sounds oddly feasible) to do the same for him: erase Clementine from his mind.With Mierzwiak's aides, Stan (Mark Ruffalo, sporting the Einstein \"bed-head\" 'do) and the slimy Patrick (Elijah Wood, with a panty-stealing penchant and a lunatic giggle, seemingly intent on wiping the *audience's* memories of his cutesy hobbit mien), Joel undergoes the erasure procedure, but as his memories regress (with his body unconscious, but his dream self somehow watching and participating in this regression), his Clementine memories become less antagonistic, veering towards enjoyable and then, he realizes too late, downright \"precious.\" His dream self fights against the erasure, trying to hold onto the pleasant memories, realizing that if every trace of Clementine were wiped, somehow a piece of himself would disappear also.Director Michael Gondry has captured on film one of the most ineffable human experiences ¬ñ the dream state: the feeling that everything you are experiencing is somehow sensible, yet not making sense; that you are running mightily yet making no headway; that underlying cohesion and overarching dread. Using nothing but hand-held cameras and stark lighting in some sequences (in others, utilizing disappearing sets and suddenly-changing landscapes), Gondry evokes that desperate, visceral fear that irrationally gluts our dreams. Add screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (*Being John Malkovich, Adaptation*) and the disturbing irrationality only escalates.The film's title is excerpted from a poem by Alexander Pope, \"Eloisa to Abelard,\" the same poem that puppeteer John Cusack enacts in another of Charlie Kaufman's screenplays, the beatifically bizarre, *Being John Malkovich*.One cannot overstate Carrey's brilliance in this role. Watching his unshaven, haggard, insecure paragon of introversion, Joel, it is impossible to imagine an Ace Ventura careening across the screen monopolizing every oxygen atom within reach.Carrey's tastefully subdued performance is contrasted with that of Winslet's gregarious Clementine, a talkative, intrusive young woman who at first impression seems to have dropped too much acid in the nineties. When Clementine insidiously, yet forcefully seduces Joel on a train, we realize we have seen this character in cinema before: the pushy young wench who unlocks the heart of gold beneath the shy guy. But why do screenwriters believe that a talkative and obtrusive woman is somehow \"attractive\" or \"spunky\"? There's another term for insecure, attention-seeking, irritatingly extroverted women who suck all the energy out of a room with their rattling bicuspids ¬ñ high maintenance.Joel wants to retain the happy memories - but he's got it all backwards. It is these memories that wrench you with unquenchable longing, making you apt to do something stupid - like getting back with her. It is the bad memories ¬ñ those weak-chested churnings impotence and disrespect - that will keep you sensible enough to never call the crazy bitch again. But who wants to shoulder that unsavory burden? Just erase the lot, and you'll never have to forget regret.Before their brain-wipe, each person is required to make a cassette recording of all the aspects about their wipee they cannot stand. Due to a subplot involving Mierzwiak's infatuated, spurned secretary (Kirsten Dunst), both Joel and Clementine receive their partner's recordings to listen to, and we realize that the present-time storyline is Joel's and Clementine's *second* meeting, independent of - and unaware of - their previous relationship.And what we thought was a unique exploration of despair, coupled with repression and regression ramifications; a film which alluded to god-complexes (the doctor's command of Joel's brainwaves) and self-persecution paradoxes (Joel is a self-persecuting personality, which is why he gravitates towards women like Clementine) topples from its lofty aspirations to explore the girly-man question of whether you would re-commit to someone whom you have already discerned you cannot stand.For the sake of sating the expectations of young girls, Joel and Clementine poignantly avow their love for one another, despite the evidence of their damning testimonies on tape. Couples Being Paired is the grand device that engines 95-percent of cinema seen in America. From *Star Wars* to *Gentleman's Agreement*, from *Crocodile Dundee* to *Rock Star*, no matter the ostensible theme or subject matter of the movie, it will always boil down to the point of view of the paired couple, against all adversity. In this film, the adversity is *the couple itself*.Does this say something about the fact that true love will triumph even over mismatched personalities ¬ñ or that people will do anything to get into each other's pants? So after scaring us with faceless dream-people and nightmare corridors and potential brain damage and ¬ñ the most horrible ugliness of fall - girlfriends who won't stop talking, Eternal Sunshine ends up as just another quirky romance clothed in a Real Movie's drama suit.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)\n",

But when I watched it carefully on DVD, I saw the sly magical performances given by all the actors.First off, Jim Carrey gave one of his best performances. He was completely overlooked throughout award season. His performance as the depressed, unlivable Joel Barrish was so dignified. It's great to see an comedic actor try something different and succeed.Second, Kate Winslet is phenomenal. She creates a corky but intelligent heroine who stole the film. I loved every single one of her scenes. Winslet played against-the-type as Clementine Kruczynski and is magnificent to watch. Definitely one of the most memorable characters I've ever seen.With that said, all the other actors were great as well.

      "Joel (Jim Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contracts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson), to have Clementine removed from his own memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier passion. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get her out of his head.The film is imaginary, sad, and funny and it is wonderfully acted. I have always liked Charlie Kaufman films but this one blows the others right out of th water.\n",

      "Contains spoilers! now this is a GREAT film. its original, great acting and superv directing. i had no trouble at all following this film, although it can be confusing. this is one of the only films i can watch over and over. i think this might be the best love story ever told. it's very sad, and just plain remarkable....it starts with Joel Barish, (Jim Carrey), waking up one monring on his way to work. he keeps a journal in which he writes all of his thoughts, ideas, and draws pictures. he realizes that he has ripped out pages and see's that he hasn't written in two years. at a resteraunt, he see's clementide kerchynski, or whatever, and they begin talking.after talking and having a serious relationship, Joel goes and talks to her. she acts like she doesn't even know him. It turns out Clementide erased Joel from her mind. So to forget about all this, Joel does it too. Joel has to get rid of anything, movies, clothes, pictures, presents, whatever, so there isn't a unexplainable presence in their homes. Well, while erasing the memories of her, Joel experiences the memories, and thinks the memories are too important and he loves them too much, so he tries calling the process off. this movie is just amazing. One of Jim Carrey's best performances. 10/10\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is my favorite film. Every character is rich and full of depth, the emotions are subtle but absolutely real, and Jim Carrey gives us the finest acting we have ever seen from him.The concept of the film is an astonishing creation that could only be Kaufman-esquire but the addition of Michel Gondry is delightful. His low special effects camera work and film-making style astounds me. The cinematography is some of the best that I've ever seen especially during the erasing process feeling which felt like a real dream with all its confusions and contortions. Eternal Sunshine was the first movie that I could personally watch over and over and get new emotions every time. I love every character for their flaws and the actors' amazing abilities to create completely real people is spectacular.This film was completely ignored come Oscar time (besides its deserved screenplay award and Kate Winslet's acting nod). Jim Carrey (acting), Michel Gondry (directing), Jon Brion (score), Ellen Kuras (cinematography), and the special effects team should have been nominated for all their respective categories.Eternal Sunshine is the best movie to convey the them of love, loss of love, and redemption that I have ever seen in my entire life. Jim Carrey is one of the finest dramatic actors we have working these days and I wish that he could do more movies like this and The Truman Show.\n",

      "Once again, writer Charlie Kaufman creates an interesting story that challenges traditional cinema with 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. In this film, the audience experiences first-hand the psychological trauma of Joel (Jim Carrey)as he loses and tries to hang on to his memories of Clemintine (Kate Winslet). The cinematography and special effects truly capture the dream-like sense of being in Joel's head while the scenes in Joel's apartment ground the film in reality. With some strong performances from Carrey and Winslet, as well as the supporting cast, 'Eternal Sunshine' is a worthwhile film to see. 'Eternal Sunshine' does, however, have its challenges. Similar to previous Kaufman screenplays (like 'Being John Malcovich), this film requires its audience to be patient as the plot does move along slowly. While this film does offer something unique to the film industry it may not be for everyone. But if you are prepared to step outside the boundaries of Hollywood cinema and into the world of independent film, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is an intriguing place to start.\n",

      "An original film.Winslet is very annoying in the first 10 minutes, but sit through it if you can. It pays off much later.Jim Carrey on very good form and his role in the film is worth it on its own. Winslet is a little on the annoying side (and if you aren't a fan of hers, you will hate the first few minutes) however she is clearly fulfilling a very specific role.This film deals with a \"kuki\" love story and the bits that sometimes go wrong. Trust me on the first 30 minutes, it does get much better!It will make you think about relationships.\n",

      "I really really enjoyed this film although many of my friends told me it was strange I thought it was brilliant. Many parts were very confusing but I did follow it and it was incredible interesting as well as funny. All the characters were excellent and Joel and Clementine in particular were very easy to get attached to. It was a very original idea and the whole film in my opinion was handled fantastically! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet played roles that were unlike their usual stereotypical ones, really well. I didn't seem like Jim Carrey to me without the outrageous gags and over-the-top humour but I really liked it. Overall excellence. Funny, touching, thoughtful and intelligent I would happily see it again and probably will do!\n",

      "I have seen this film so many times and I am watching it as I am writing these lines. I love the writing, great acting, I mean Kate is awesome and so adorable! And Jim is amazing which makes the two of them the perfect casting choice for this story. What a great story, a theme we all deal with every time we go thru a break up and when we stay married and get boring and when we start a new relationship. It's all in there and it is express in such a beautiful way. Clementine and Joel what a couple, I'd say couple number one. The only funny thing is Frodo showing up in the middle of the film, I think he to a wrong turn on his way to mordor. But Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson are great. i don't care much for Dunst, but I guess she does her job for the role. So all in all film you want your relationship to be like, and most probably it is!\n",

      "You can't help but be captured by the charm and wit of this movie. The director takes us on a journey through the meaning of love and delivers a classic film that will be treasured for years to come.It's interesting that much was made of the casting of both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet against type, for me though it is a measure of both actors talent that this is not what you think about when watching them as the story develops.The overriding message for me was that love will find a way, if it's meant to be it will happen. A message that could so easily become cute and cloying unless you have a script of such class and a director who was willing to venture into the unconventional, backed by a cast willing to follow both. Full marks to all concerned, a truly original film that gives hope and teaches us to cherish the things we have.There is a quirkiness to some of the performances that adds to the film, in particular Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood who had great chemistry in the mind erasing scenes. The two lead actors I have mentioned but both performances were their best to date.\n",

      "Joel Barish(Jim Carrey),depressed and forlorn over being pushed out of a relationship with his flaky but irresistible girlfriend Clementine(Kate Winslet),decides he'll also go to get his memory erased at an experimental procedure,headed by a kindly doctor(Tom Wilkinson). During the process,Joel makes the realization that he,in fact,despite the pains that Clementine put him through,doesn't really want to lose those memories of her,and proceeds to fight the process as it is happening to him.Director Michel Gondry co-wrote this story with none other than existential re-arranger non-pareil Charlie Kaufmann,and the end product is no less stunning or thought-provoking. Basically,this film is a love story minus the rapturous wonder of BEING in love. It's a realization of appreciating a relationship and what one gets from it,through the good AND bad. This is a concept that's probably been danced around before,but I have to believe it's never quite been examined THIS way before.Jim Carrey and KAte Winslet are in rare form here,Carrey in particular. Eschewing his usual,rubber-faced absurdity in favor of a straight caricature,while it's not a complete departure for him(some examples: MAn on the Moon,The Truman Show),it is somewhat out of form for the one-time stand-up,and he is excellent here. Winslet gets a chance to A)not be English and B)be a character that is probably somewhat difficult to be lifted from the pages it's been written on. Wilkinson's role as a doctor who may be more scrupulously at question here doesn't APPEAR to be different than usual(try In the Bedroom),but he still mines this one for effectiveness. The supporting turns by Mark Ruffalo,Elijah Wood,Kirsten Dunst,Jane Adams and David Cros are considerably less defined but(particularly in Dunst's case)nicely workable into the fabric of this story.Difficult movie material to relate to any average audience to be sure,but as another comment person put it,if you \"get it\" with this film,this will be quite the positive movie experience.\n",

      "There's something that every great writer worth his weight in Number Two pencils knows about love, (as did the immortal Debbie Harry when she sang the phrase above). And it's this: as fragile as it is and therefore worth handling with the utmost care, none of us really know a damn thing about it or how to deal with it. Besides, when we fall in love with someone and they with us, we're not falling for one person, but three: the one that swept us off our feet in the first place; the person whom we hope they will become as we grow old together, and the person that they really are at the end of the day.And as our loved ones are a trio and not just one personality, our relationships ebb and flow in three stages: love's first rapturous blush, the \"big reveal\" as we begin to find out things about this person that we love and hate, and the Last Stage, when the bloom is completely off the rose, and you have a decision to make--continue the journey on together, or find another traveling companion.All of the above and more is eloquently and brilliantly expressed in one of the best movies ever made on the subject, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. It comes as no big surprise that the co-author of this damn-near perfect deconstruction of desire and disappointment is one Charlie Kaufman (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, ADAPTATION). One of the bigger shocks is that the other writer and director is Michel Gondry, to whose work I have only been previously exposed via the hit-and-miss Robin Williams vehicle HUMAN NATURE. (Thank goodness that my first impression wasn't at all accurate. Ditto for Kaufman, who was just \"testing his swing\" before hitting a homer with MALKOVICH.) We begin by meeting everyman Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a nice if somewhat non-descript guy, living a pretty much non-descript existence, his hopes, dreams, fears and desires neatly compartmentalized from the rest of his life inside his journal. Joel is sensible, practical, polite, thoughtful and never, ever impulsive. Then, he meets his polar opposite, Clementine, (Kate Winslet exploding out of Corset World). She is erratic, impulsive, confrontational, messy, intrusive and everything Joel couldn't possibly be on his worst day without Starbuck's. There is no reason on God's green earth they should be attracted to each other, but what do ya know? They are.And things go great for awhile, then from great to good, good to okay, okay to not-so-good, etc. When it gets beyond the last stage, Clementine decides that she wants Joel erased from her life forever, and as she is prone to do, she impulsively goes to a place called Lacuna, Inc., which specializes in just that...erasures. They literally wipe the slate clean - that slate being your mind - so that no trace and no memories of your ex will ever plague you again.Already heartbroken, when the devastated Joel learns what Clementine has done, he decides to do the same...only to discover (or re-discover) that not all the times they had together were awful, and that some memories are worth keeping forever, no matter what. And what he decides to do to try and hold on to those memories are where the story really kicks into gear, turning sublime, silly and very sad all at once.The joys and sorrows of discovering a tale this remarkable are always best experienced without a lot of foreknowledge, and that's how I will leave the more startling and surprising details...for you to find.All I can say is this: if no one had ever seen a Jim Carrey film before and this was his introduction to the world, it would be like seeing Tom Hanks for the first time. That is how complete and profound his transformation is into Joel. We like him, we REALLY, REALLY like him, and though we hardly want to see him suffer, we realize soon enough that what he goes through with \"darlin' Clementine\" is totally necessary to transform them both into better people.Oh, yes, and there's Clemmy, herself. I always knew that Kate was dying to sink her teeth into a role that didn't require a corset and a bustle. (Helena Bonham Carter, eat your heart out!) If you are still wincing over TITANIC'S thick treacle, her performance in SUNSHINE will come as a tart but tasty surprise.And kudos must be given to the strong supporting cast. Kirsten Dunst showing a winsomeness she hasn't accessed in many moons; Elijah Wood in a role that is somehow slimy, pathetic and yet movingly sympathetic; Tom Wilkinson, Jane Adams and David Cross whose solid and invaluable work is integral to the plot, (but can't be commented on here without giving up some glaring spoilers), and Mark Ruffalo, who does the nearly impossible by making man-boy geekiness sexy.Most of all, we have to go back and high-five director Gondry, DP Ellen Kuras and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir for recognizing the special story that Kaufman fashioned, for letting it breathe and allowing it to go where it needed...to show the destructive and transforming power of love, and how and WHY we need it, no matter how high it lifts us up...or how hard it lets us fall.Everyone will take something different away from this, so see it with someone you're dating...or even someone you're breaking up with. You never know what might happen, and even at the worst times, there could still be good that comes from it...just ask Joel and Clem.\n",

      "A girlfriend or boyfriend that doesn't work out can be one of the most painful things we can ever experience. If given the chance would you really want to erase them completely from your memory? The title of this film could be written as a question: Is there eternal sunshine for the spotless mind? Or perhaps we have to take the risk of great pain if we are to ever experience great joy and to really live life.The science behind it is kinda reminiscent of the science behind the matrix. Somewhat questionable. However as with the matrix if you can suspend disbelief it doesn't matter. The film is one that needs to be watched at least twice. The order is not strictly chronological and on the first watching you might not have a clue what's going on. However bare with it. When it started to make sense to me it bought tears to my eyes with its poignancy.One of my all time great films. Jim Carey who got on my nerves in Dumb and Dumber is excellent in this more serious role. Great script, great acting and a haunting soundtrack make a great movie. A must see.Oh and well worth a watch with a plate of special K. Hehehe...\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is definitely one of the most beautiful films that I've ever seen in my life. It centers on the life of Joel Barish, played by Jim Carrey. The story begins on Valentine's Day 2004 when Joel falls in love at the cafeteria with Clementine (played by Kate Winslet, who deserved her 4th Oscar nomination in this wonderful film). The first few scenes are interesting because they introduce each other when having conversations at the train and especially when Joel took Clementine home, but when Patrick (Elijah Wood of LOTR & Sin City) went to Joel's car the following morning, he decides to end up a relationship with Clementine.With the help of psychiatrist Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson, Normal), things get better as Joel is placed at the machine that will make his memories erase with the woman that he loves. He is afraid to do that attempt at first because he might suffer brain damage, but as time goes by, he felt nervous and unstable. Both Lacuna employees Mark Ruffalo (as the technician) and Kirsten Dunst (as the receptionist) guide him at all times while Joel is undergoing an operation at the hospital.The flashbacks of both Joel and Clementine are seen during the entire film. From the Dinner at Kings to the impressive elephant parade and most especially at the Frozen Charles River where they decided to stay at the house for a while, they suffered ups and downs in their romance. The erasure of the memory process is replaced in each scene when Joel suffers unpleasant relationships with Clementine. We can see that certain things such as the bookcase and the titles of books are lost in several minutes as Joel's relationship with Clementine blooms. The ending became pitch-perfect when he brings Clementine back to his mind and starts a new chapter of their relationship.I am not a big fan of romantic comedies, but this movie definitely captured my imagination because love happens when relationship goes better. I found at first Jim Carrey weird in his past films, but in this film, he becomes a full-fledged and serious dramatic actor like Sean Penn and Robin Williams. Kate Winslet, who was first recognized in Sense and Sensibility and the Oscar-Winning Titanic, truly can act despite suffering weaknesses in relationships with Carrey in certain scenes. And for the rest of the cast, including Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood, deserved wonderful performances as well. If we will sum up all the scenes in the film, romance never fades as relationship becomes sweeter.\n",

      "Jim Carrey has changed into a dramatic yet romantic character. Movie may be confusing first or second time watching but soon you may catch on to the order of time that things happened. Good story, good movie. Can compare characters to real life people. I've watched it many times and still enjoy it, I'm soon going to watch it together with my fianc√© on her birthday. Good movie for couples who have broken up and reunited later, you may be able to compare these characters to how you were before. I also thought it was great they took the title of the movie from the line of a poem that also fits with the story of the movie. Two thumps up.\n",

      "All I can say is that I never thought Jim Carrey can pull off such a performance, simply brilliant. I always hated him and this movie totally changed my mind about him...Now, the movie is a little complicated and starts off slow, I had it for a while and every time I watched the first 15 mins, I fell asleep, BUT, if you have patience and let it go through the story, you will be amazed towards the end. It is simply one of the best love stories I have ever seen without any cheesy Hollywood romance.To appreciate it best, need to watch it at least twice. The first time I watched, I really liked it... then it was on Cable the other day and after watching it again I was just blown away. If you have EVER been truly in love, you can relate to everything in this movie. Characters are real, stories are true, love is portrayed as it happens and it's just an incredible story. It also has some science fiction mixed in which doesn't take away from the story and actually adds to it.Totally recommended, among the top 5 movies of the last 2 years!\n",

      "wow, i can't believe i just put that in the title. I didn't think i would ever be able to decide which is Jim Carrey's best movie, or at least, which one i enjoy the most, (i'm a massive fan!) Eternal sunshine takes the cake without a shadow of a doubt! despite the fact that it is critically acclaimed for it's brilliant, visionary techniques, (mainly thanks to director Michel Gondry). It's good to see Carrey taking some risks, stepping outside silly comedy which is his bread and butter, and i think it is obvious that Jim has enjoyed the change. he plays his character extremely well, weaving in and out of 'quiet, insecure Joel' to 'fun-loving Jim Carrey of old.' The Charlie Kaufman script is sometimes hard to follow, but if you follow the dialogue close enough, you will notice when the jumps from memory to Joel's current thoughts happen. Kate Winslet lights up the screen as the beautiful Clemntine, who is somewhat of an enigma in the film, but you grow to love her obnoxious, and sometimes quite shockingly foul mouth. With an impressive supporting cast of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson, they provide the movie with interesting side stories and an essential parallel story as well. such is the rich tapestry of a Kaufmann script, you don't really know how the story will end, but you will be pleasantly by the end, as it holds it's integrity, and doesn't resort to a 'let's make everyone happy feel good ending'. must see, 10/10\n",

After a painful break up, Clemendine decides to use the \"services\" provided by a \"brain\" clinic. What are these services??

      "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)I'm sure watching this a few times will have the effect of erasing any confusion you might have. I am sure. But...well, I can't recall if I ever saw this film. Yet, yet... There's Jim Carrey in my mind playing a straight role. Sorta straight. Actually Kate Winslet has most of the good comedic lines. I can't tell whether she was once a girl friend of mine or if I watched her in a movie. She says she's high maintenance and she has to have a different color for her hair every week. Yeah, I remember her. My god she was nice. Quirky, but nice.And then she erased all memory of me. I saw her in this book store and she pretended she didn't know me. Didn't know me! Wow, after all we had been through. I mean she's an emotional roller coaster. And that really dissed me off so I had my memory of her erased. And then we began to see each other in strange places, on the beach--but that was right. I met her on the beach. But then I was a child and she was there under the kitchen table, and my mom washed me in the sink and I felt so secure and Clementine oh my darling you are lost and gone forward, dreadful sorry Clementine was so, so sweet and so so pretty and just a nut case.And then there's Kirsten Dunst, she of the incredibly agreeable figure, dancing over my body as I lay electronically stoned. Mary, her name is. She and the doc had this fling. He would get her to somehow seduce him and then erase the memory and then get her to do it again. Really bummed his wife out.Oh, but Clem and I are here as on a darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night and I think something's missing, the ground or the sky or some wall or maybe something is fused together that shouldn't be fused together, like this old house on the beach that Clem broke into, I mean she has balls, and I was just a fraidy cat, and wait, wait, I am gaining control. She and I together are chasing down the missing parts of our memories erased by the evil Lacuna Inc. people. All these memory movies going through my head--Memento (2000) especially, by Christopher Nolan. There's something going on here with these memory movies. I think Oliver Sacks has something to do with it. Are we just our memories, and who would we be without our memories? Would life be worth living? If we just lived in the here and the now would we be animals? Anyway, this is a love story, the love story of my life. But is it possible to selectively erase memories? I mean creating lacunar infarcts on purpose? Is that legal? It is safe? Lacunar infarcts come from strokes that leave little blank spaces in your brain so that you're missing something like the memory of your first kiss or the time you saw Wayne's World..Okay, this is science fiction like Vanilla Sky (2001) with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. The dialogue is really sharp with all sorts of witticism written mostly by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who also wrote the script for Being John Malkovich (1999). Need I say more? I mean clever with a capital K. By the way, idle thought: Clementine's last name is Kruczynski. Isn't that the Unibomber's last name, good old Ted? No, that was Kaczynski. Okay, never mind. Anyway, here's a clever line: \"Are we like couples you see in restaurants? Are we the dining dead?\" I think I said that, or wish I had. Or, \"Drink up young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.\" She said that, and I guess she oughta know, heaven help us, from first hand experience.Look, if I ever, but ever, get a chance to fall in love with Kate Winslet, please, please, do NOT erase the memory. Thank you.Bottom line: bizarro and entertaining, witty and cute, with a nice cast. And Jim Carrey as a straight up kinda guy is a terrific actor, and Kate, well I'll tell you a secret, gentlemen. You can see a full frontal sans clothes shot of her in the movie Jude (1996). Yes. Also worth watching is her debut film Heavenly Creatures (1994) shot when she was 18.One last line, as Joel says, \"Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.\"\n",

      "This film has expressed the deep feeling of love, of relationship between people to me, it's so warm when I have finished the film, 'I'm fine without you', it was touchable. What's more, the way the director annotates this film is quite interesting and novel, by erasing our memories can we really forget things? Even people that we deeply loved before? At last, I think King Karie's films are the most interesting, very comfortable and acceptable. Although I have to admit that at first sight I can not quite understand what was going on in the film, however, when I finally realized what was happening, I suddenly felt that I was the man whose memory had been erased, I cannot just lost my girl just because of my impulsion. The spotless mind keeps its purity thanks to the eternal sunshine, that is love, it's love that makes us spotless. It's eternal love that makes us survive and live. Thank you, this is an excellent film.\n",

      "You just have to see it at least twice to appreciate it. It's the talk of the town that movies based on Charlie Kaufman scripts are not for everyone. One of the better qualities of the movie is that you might not expect it to be a sci-fi. It's full of surprises. I've heard people walked out on it in theaters, probably expecting another mediocre Jim Carrey comedy. Too bad for them.It's not as dark as Being John Malkovich, though it is deeper. The two main characters do not seem as neurotic as their Kaufman based 'predecessors'. Although they are still insecure, somewhat in doubt and 'looking for their own piece of mind'. That's why we like them so much. Their seemingly insignificant inner characteristics can be easily exposed to a two hour 'investigation'. And that's pretty much what all the movies that have been written by Charlie Kaufman are about. Each time, the audience is sent on a brief inner expedition, into a not so prominent individual. Besides the story it is all enriched with excellent music. A calm little tune is played every now and then that makes the whole thing more memorable. After it's all said and done a mix of bitter-sweet sensation takes you over. And you feel the need for love, like the eternal sunshine......... +4/5 ........\n",

      "This is a real mind bender (no pun intended). I really liked the premise because it opens up great implications for us all. How far are we from the manipulation of specific brain centers? We can already do a fair amount. The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we can't curtail the \"butterfly effect \"of our actions. We have trod the earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new. Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being \"forced\" back together because despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we are part of the entire picture.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine is weird and sad. However, it is funny in a strange way, and the concept of the whole thing is very interesting. I have only seen it once, but I certainly think it is one of those movies that you can't watch once and get every detail. It is very complex. Also, the cast is great. I love Jim Carrey as a comedian, but it is refreshing to see him in a role where he doesn't contort his face every five minutes. Kate Winslet is very goofy at times, especially at the beginning, but she can also become serious on the fly and I respect that. I like the fact that Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are in this movie. They are great actors. This is a thought-provoking movie and it is genuinely enjoyable. Certainly worth a watch.\n",

      "I wish I could write and write whatever comes in my mind about this magnificent piece of art called film-making. But all those would ultimately come to one bottomline: I don't give the credit to the director, as it is Kaufman's masterpiece screen writing that brings such magic to this film to make it one of the best examples of modern fimmaking.The idea of revisiting the memories is so overused and equally ill-treated in films that I'm sure every other screenwriter would mess it up in the end. But Kaufman pulled it off flawlessly. In a non-linear film such as this, I'm also surprised by the directing style. And it also helped to have such a fantastic cast. Carrey, playing a normal commonplace guy this time without any of his trademark characteristics and antics, reminds us that he is primarily a genius actor regardless of the type of film. Winslet, having a magnificent consistency of skill in each film is always a treat to watch. Her portrayal of Clementine is perhaps one of her bests... along with Finding Neverland and Jude. And there are also good supporting roles played by Wilkinson and the ever-interesting Mark Ruffalo.The film does carry an interesting message about love and relationship and sacrifice and adjustment. Those who can relate to them will definitely like the film more and more. When I saw the film a year ago, I didn't have any such experience which could make me take the film more personally. But I do have one now, which I can somehow relate to the film's message. That made me discover its wonders again.\n",

The plot is surreal, yet believable, while the characters interact in a three-dimensional way.Simply put, this movie is about a man named Joel (Jim Carrey) who undergoes a special treatment to get the memory of his ex-girlfriend (Kate Winslet) erased after their rough break-up. He watches with bitter resentment as the most recent memories are erased. But when he sees that all the good memories are going too, Joel immediately regrets his decision.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a love story, but only on the surface. The real story is that people want to get rid of all their bad experiences, but we fail to realize that the bad make the good all the more sweeter.

      "Eternal Sunshine is an example of a brilliant idea for a short film drawn out into a full length feature it cannot handle. The premise of a man erasing his memories of a failed romance only to realise within his memory the love he still feels is certainly an original and inspired one, but it deserved better treatment.Fantastically conceived visually, with characters' faces disappearing and objects simply erasing themselves, the film suffers from Carrey being simply too whiny and unlikable a lead in this (compared to his considerably more lovable and justifiably upset Truman in the Truman Show). His relationship with Winslet's Clementine is simply unbelievable. I has been said that opposites attract but these two are simply too opposite. There romance seems to boil down to little more than an intense sexual attraction, and little more, although Carrey gets across in his voice that he is in love, the script seems to argue otherwise.The film is dragged about by some excruciatingly dull subplots starring talented but misused actors (Wood, Dunst), which seem only in place to make the ending come about as it does (Wood's role for example is extremely unsettling and manipulative, but neither he nor the script pull it off).The music is as times terrific and at others dull and confusing in its use.But Carrey and the fantastic art direction manage to make this a very entertaining film, that alas wears thin with repeated viewing.Certainly worth a peek for those interested in modern pseudo-philosophical cinema.\n",

      "This is the first time I have liked anything Jim Carrey has done - what a pleasure to see him play a quiet, understated role; I fell a bit in love with that character! So typical for Kaufman, the story is quirky, highly original and funny. The scenes of the Stan and Mary, the Carrey and the Winslet characters cavorting and playing together are so sweet and funny and human, it gave me a bit of a pang, me who has been alone for so long. As painful as human interaction can be, as much as you might want to forget certain screw-ups that you have made in your life, much there is sweet and should be cherished forever (my personal subtext that I inject into the movie). Go - you will not regret it.\n",

      "What a brilliant, original and challenging film this is. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind likely falls into the category of romantic comedy, but that would put it on the same shelf as America's Sweethearts or Two Weeks Notice. This is immeasurably more.Charlie Kaufman is the prolific writer of quirky and bizarre screenplays. Since 1999, he has written three films (including this one) that you can strongly argue were the best pictures of the year. He writes unique and almost deliberately odd movies, but they never some across as weirdness for its own sake.How to describe the plot? (This is not a plot-driven film). Jim Carrey is Joel - as bit of a loser who lacks confidence in himself. Kate Winslet is Clementine, a blue haired off the wall kooky chick, the exact type that Joel should repel. They start a relationship and are in love.As the relationship goes sour, they have a quick and nasty break up. Clementine goes to firm that can erases memories and has Joel erased from her mind. Joel decides to do the same, but his memories of Clementine are so deeply entrenched that they refuse to go away easily.Kaufman and director Michel GOndry take this simple sounding premise, tell it in a non-linear format and take it in directions no viewer can predict. The result is a touching, haunting and moving emotional experience that will linger with you long after the film is over. If you liked Being John Malkovich and Adapation, chances are you will like Eternal Sunshine as well. This films could not be more different, but they have the common threads Kaufmans pen.Carrey and Winslet are backed up by an amazing support cast, including ELijah Wood, Kirten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson and Mark Ruffalo.Here you have a memory loss film where the characters choose to loose their memory. The film examines the moral, social and even logistic implications of this, without losing the nature of the romance. It takes every convention of it genre, chucks it out the window and starts from there. ***1/2 out of ****.\n",

      "I'm a 15 y.o boy, not a big fan of the romance. I was bored and decided to watch it. Jim Carrey has obviously proved himself capable of doing serious roles, The Truman Show being the best so far, no doubt in my mind that he couldn't have pulled it off. And with flying colors he passes the test again. He manages to portray Joel Barish with so much depth and purity, you'd think he was incapable of doing comedy. Nothing special to point about Kate Winslet's performance, though also great, not outstanding.The storyline is nothing but pure genius remains that way until the credits roll. It has amazing cinematography, flashbacks, and the script itself is a piece of art.Thus making this film into a modern-day classic. Lovers of every genre will enjoy this, it's just one of movies you have to have seen. You will never regret it, trust me, I haven't. - Sheer Brilliance. -\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004): Like other films of the last few years, there continues to be a rush to shatter, spin, crank, or turn inside out the plot structure. To whom shall we give credit? Quentin Tarantino and his \"Pulp Fiction\"? Well, like any FASHION trend, it can used as an empty, stylish method to hide a lack of substance, or, LIKE \"Eternal Sunshine...\" it can be used to support the topsy turvy story it sets out to tell. We learn that a man (Jim Carey) has been rejected by a woman (Kate Winslet), and he's pretty torn up about it. We then learn he wants to get her back. Standard fare. THEN things change. You'd better be of clear head when you watch this one, because it's going to challenge you with it's depictions of alternate realities, internal visualizations, and moments that for some time will feel helter skelter. Only with work will you keep up. Honest...hmm..m....unless I'm just a Dumb or Dumber Guy. Here are some of the pleasant surprises (and I'm giving away NOTHING by listing these, so you can open your eyes again now): Jim Carey can now be considered a good actor along with a great comedian. It happened to Bill Murray and Robin Williams too. This is an innovative, thoughtful film that asks a lot from you. There ya go. Love it or leave it on those terms. It does NOT pander to the audience.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a compelling and sentimental alternative science fiction film that oozes style and is full of artistic quality. Charlie Kaufman writes a totally original film that beautifully expresses the point of not appreciating what you have until it's gone. The idea of memory erasure has been done before but never has a film gone to such great lengths to explore the sub conscious mind as this film does.The direction of the film is inspiring. The way Joel's (Jim Carrey) sub conscious intertwines with his past memories is so cleverly done and so subtle, that it requires absolute attention from anyone watching. It is always a sign of effective film making when an audience actually enjoys been made to concentrate and this is a credit to Michel Gondry as director. Gondry had a clear vision when making this film and I believe he expressed it exactly how he wanted to.The element that helps Gondry realise his vision the most in Eternal Sunshine are the performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Both have proved themselves fine actors on many occasions but this could certainly be a career best for both of them, especially Carrey. Carrey successfully shook off his 'rubber face' typecast with The Truman Show but he still played his roles rather over the top. This is possibly the first time we have seen Jim Carrey in such an understated role and it is refreshing to witness. His character in the real world is an average guy you can see around every corner, yet in his mind, he is a desperate man, passionate to keep hold of Clementine (Winslet). As she always is, Winslet is terrific. Her character is so multi layered and challenging, but Winslet copes with her role and shows why she is considered such a good actress. Clementine is such a different character; she is spontaneous, aggressive, loving, insecure, blunt¬Ö",
      ". the list of personality traits is endless which makes her such an interesting character to watch.The scenes in the real world involving Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson all do a fantastic job of raising the question of ethics. Wood's involvement is clearly inappropriate and Dunst and Ruffalo's behaviour is irresponsible and disrespectful. The fact that Joel is oblivious to what is happening in his apartment reflects the blind faith people have when they are been operated on or being cared for. Dunst is very good in her role as a girl brainwashed by Lacuna Inc.'s ideals, hiding a secret crush. Her turn at the end of the film is very convincing and does a great job at conveying moral dilemmas of such practices if they ever were to take place.The music complements the film tremendously. It adds to the surrealism of what is going on and also does well to highlight the film's softer moments. Even the song by Polyphonic Spree, who I can't stand, fits in well within this film. Gondry puts a lot of effort in to maintaining the atmosphere and does a lot of this through the score.One of the most thought provoking films there has been in a long time, Eternal Sunshine is a truly great film, starring two truly great actors. It might not be to everyone's taste but for the target audience, the film is near perfect.\n",

      "This is probably my favorite Jim Carrey movie. In this film we see a strangely subdued and vulnerable Jim Carrey not being up to his usual tricks and it works beautifully. We saw some of Carrey's dramatic potential in The Truman Show (also an excellent Jim Carrey film) but in this one he goes all out. Dramatically speaking. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is above all a love story but it does indeed have an interesting approach to the subject. I don't want to give a summary of the film and I don't think it would be entirely possible because being a true Charlie Kaufman (the writer) movie its really kind of weird and at some points you have no idea what is happening. However, unlike Being John Malkovich (1999) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't seem quite as pretentious in spite of the fact that it stares more mainstream actors as the main characters.The acting is top notch. Jim Carrey has his performance of a lifetime and truly proves that the type casting he usually seems to be a victim of can be broken. I have never seen Jim Carrey in a role like this before and I must admit going into the film I had my doubts about his abilities (I am not saying I don't enjoy his acting generally speaking I just didn't know if Carrey could go all the way through with it) but my concerns were quickly put to rest. Carrey's performance is spot on and his emotional range is considerable. Kate Winslet plays the female lead and having only seen her in Titanic prior to this film I thought she would suck. She didn't, however and I was happy to hear that she had been nominated for an Oscar because her performance is worthy of one. Her performance seems very genuine and above all real. Her reactions are totally believable and her on screen chemistry with Carrey is incredible. Very, very well done. Elijah Wood stares in this film as well and the people who have only seen him in The Lord of the Rings are in for a big surprise because (wisely) Wood is putting as much distance between him and the Frodo character so he won't get type casted as the good guy. Believe me his performance is pretty different. Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are in the film as well and while Dunst was never a good actress her performance in this film is passable. Ruffalo is pretty good and his scenes with Elijah Wood in particular are pretty interesting. Last but not least Tom Wilkinson is in the film as well. His character is pretty limited but Wilkinson does an amazing job with the character and steals almost every scene he is in.The film has a very interesting and well told story. The final outcome isn't always apparent and this is a good thing as it keeps the audience on its toes through the duration of the film which is about 1¬Ω hour. Even though the film is relatively short it has a lot of material crammed into it. Both story wise but also visually and you have to watch the film twice because of these two things. The film is actually better the second time you see it because by then you will know the basic story and can therefore pay more attention to the details and there are many of them. Even though I have seen the film quite a few times now (I never seem to get tired of it) I still catch up on some new ones with every viewing. This is what I think marks a good film. The fact that you can watch it again and it can still both surprise you and find new ways of entertaining the audience. In addition to being constantly surprising the visual style has a very fresh and original feel and at some times you get the feeling that the director had a lot of fun with the visual elements and this enthusiasm rubbed off on me as I watched the film and it makes the film very enthralling.In conclusion Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the best films I have ever seen. It was for a while on my top 10 of best films and even though it isn't any more it is still a very entertaining, thought inducing film that deserves all the praise it has gotten so far. I heartily agree with its rating on IMDb and I hope that people who watch the film in the future will watch it with an open mind and not expect another Jim Carrey comedy because it isn't. I recommend the film to all lovers of quite weird films because it certainly has its moments of sheer weirdness but it never loses track of its characters and where its taking the viewer. All in all.9/10\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a very interesting and original movie. We can see that French director Michel Gondry directs a very unconventional story, scenes are not shown in chronological order... Gondry takes a solid piece and enjoys himself in deconstructing it, he likes cutting the material in small pieces! Jim Carrey tries to forget the failure of his love story with Kate Winslet. A doctor helps him to erase the past from his mind, but at a certain moment he tries to stop that process.The film works and has the style of semi-independent American films like \"Being John Malkovich\" of Spike Jonze: surreal, funny, with a great dose of delicate madness... In fact we have the same screenwriter: Charlie Kaufman.A good movie. It's also a pleasure to see Jim Carrey in non-weird roles, he can act like any real good actor (he already demonstrated that with \"Truman Show\" and \"Man on the Moon\").\n",

      "This movie is about a very lonely guy, Joel Barish (played brilliantly by Jim Carrey). He lives alone and have a very routinish kind of life, but one day he meets a girl, Clementine Kruczynsk (Kate Winslet), and they really click. So, the time pass and they break up, Clementine erases her memory of him in a place that specialize in that, and when he finds out he decide that he want it to, so the movie begin, and its a journey in his memory. At first, all the bad things why they break up are the stuff he forgets, but then he begin to forget the good things and he want it to stop.Well the movie is great, is a very different way to tell a story and the way is done it just brilliant. Jim Carrey make an excellent job, as Kate Winslet did.Its a love story but no the traditional type. So if you like different movies, it doesn't matter what gender is your favorite, I guarantee you will enjoy this movie, and of course, this isn't a movie for everyone, so if \"transporter 2\" and \"the dukes of hazzard\" are you favorite movies better miss out this one.\n",

      "without knowing sadness how can we know what is happiness? without the baggage or lessons of the past how can we be ready to face the future? without all the different perspectives, emotions or the people in the memories to share with how can any of our memories be true? I think the movie is asking these questions. And to come to this point, I had to dissociate with the movie for a while, leave it alone, let it stir in my mind. Because when I first and again saw this film, the emotional tone set by the cinematography, color palette, performance, dialogue, time line, and of course imaginary scenes, was overwhelming.The whole presentation and structure evokes a kind of freedom and that reflects on it's characters and their imagination, and sadly this will somewhat limit the film to appeal to a similar kind of audience too.The film is an articulate reflection of the mind, possibly comments on our instincts and behavioral hiccups of the human nature, and the utter, indescribable, unpredictable, unrelenting, mess of a chaos of that is the love from the 2 opposite central characters.Jim Carey is flabbergastingly real world and Kate Winslet can finally erase Titanic from our memory.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman has once again written a memorable, unique screenplay that will have people leaving the theatre thinking, \"WTF?\" Joel Barish (Jim Carrey, you may or may not remember him from \"Rubberface\" in 1983, he hasn't really been doing much since, given his love for vacationing in the jungles of Siberia) is a typical \"nice\" guy; he keeps to himself, and, not unlike a giraffe, is fearful of human interaction. At a party, he meets up with Clementine Kruczynski (newcomer Kate Winslet, I think that we'll be seeing more from this young lady), who is vibrant and full of energy, the \"yin\" to Joel's \"yang\" (God, that was the most clich√©d BS I've ever written).After a tumultuous relationship, Clementine decides, on a whim, to erase her memories of Joel, an act which prompts him to do the same (if you could really do that, I would erase my memories of seeing \"House of 1000 Corpses\", as well as that time I saw my grandmother in leather hot pants). Most of the movie takes place inside Joel's head during his memory erasure, as he decides he doesn't really want to lose her, and fights to remember.This movie is quirky, funny, intriguing, and brilliant. It might not be the movie for everyone, but it's definitely worth mentioning.\n",

      "I really liked the idea of \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\" although, unfortunately, I haven't yet seen other works of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. The premise of memory erasure/loss may have been done many times before, but what transpires in this film is an excellent idea, a great insight into the human essence of memory and emotions. The direction of Michael Gondry and the script themselves are great and the film is even more amazing when coupled with great acting from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.Joel Barish (Carrey) discovers that his long-time girlfriend, Clementine (Winslet), has undergone an experimental procedure of the Lacuna Corporation headed by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), in which all of her memory of Joel is removed, after the couple has tried for a long time to get their relationship working fluidly. Joel sets for revenge and decides to undergo the procedure as well, to erase his memories of Clementine.At this point the film alternately takes place between reality and within Joel's mind as he follows his memories of Clementine backwards in time as each recent memory is replaced. However, once the process starts, Joel realizes he doesn't really want to forget Clementine, so he starts smuggling her away into other areas of his memory where she doesn't belong and that causes some changes about his memories as well.Most stories about love try to present a good story and, for all their faults, always have decent intentions. But if the ultimate aim is the human essence of love, then a lot of these films failed. \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\" does not fail in this regard, and it is justified by the touched feeling I got from watching it.Charlie Kaufman is a sterling writer, if this be the basis for that. The direction is, as Michael Gondry has shown here, flawless and the music perfectly matches the camera flow and character movement. From its haunting introduction to the ebbing and flowing of the memory scenes, the cinematography and the music are so in tune with each other in giving the movie its brand of eccentricity.Despite the somber tone of the movie, Carrey doesn't seem out of place here. Actually he is still a lot of fun to watch. His acting perfectly captures Joel being lost between reality and imagination - subtly shifting from the material world that is stored in his memory to vignettes of abstractions while trying to save Clementine from the process of having her erased permanently. Winslet has the natural beauty and charm as Clementine. The supporting cast of Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst all impress, too.Essentially, this movie offers one of the most stunningly inventive and intuitive glimpses at the human emotional nature and its resistance of fate that I have seen - a stunning portrayal of grief forged of a failed relationship and the abrupt ending of it. If this film is about anything, it is about someone about to go under, grabbing at the only life preserver a person can ever see - one's memories.As I've said, the direction and acting extend this beyond mediocrity to excellence, the main actors especially allowing the many moments of reminiscing to speak for themselves. The mind is strength itself, and it is shown through the flashbacks and tweaks at reality. It is human mind and emotion depiction at its finest and that rarest of things - a movie so good to be erased from memory.\n",

And the quote that gave th film it's wacky title-\"How happy is the blameless Vesals lot, the world forgetting by the world forgot- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind!- Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned.

      "Charlie Kaufman writer and Jim Carey as lead, I had high hopes going in to seeing this film. I was not disappointed. This movie met and greatly exceeded my expectations. This is a hauntingly beautiful movie about relationships and experiences. Jim Carey and Kate Winslet deliver superb performances as a likable couple that I could relate to. They are supported by a wonderful cast of colorful characters that add different textures of love, relationships and experiences. What makes this film stand far above the rest is its original plot of \"what if memory were erasable\" and the filming effects that take on the journey of the protagonist as he experiences this first hand. This movie has some spectacular moments that anyone who has been in love will be touched with a sense of connection to the characters.\n",

So he decides to do the same thing, only realizing while the process is going on that he truly doesn't want to forget her. This is a beautiful film dealing with love, loss, grief, acceptance, anger, and the shades in between, that I almost gave up on watching (I tried to get into it before, but due to the unbearable slowness of the beginning I had turned off a little after the opening credits rolled). I'm so very glad that I gave it another chance, as I found it to be an extremely heartfelt,honest, and rewarding film. All the performances are pretty much spot-on and this is without a doubt Jim Carrey's best performance ever in a film, hands down. I truly can't fathom why a lot of viewers found this movie to be hard to comprehend, as I found the movie pretty straight forward in it's simplicity, despite the roundabout way it choose to present itself.My Grade: A- DVD Extras: Disc 1)Commentary by director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman; \"A Look Inside 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'\" featurette; \"A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry\"; 7 minutes of Deleted scenes; Polyphonic Spree \"Light & Day\" Music Video; fake Lacuna commercial; Promo for Focus Pictures; Trailers for \"Vanity Fair\", and \"The Motercycle Diaries\" Disc 2) 20 minute \"Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry\" featurette; 17 minute \"Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue\" featurette; A Conversation with Kate Winslet and director Michel Gondry; and more Deleted/Extended Scenes Random notes: Also comes with a 28 page booklet\n",

      "It's rather safe to say, than Jim Carrey has finally rose from the ranks of Ace Ventura (if someone still doubted him after Man On The Moon) as a \"real\" actor.Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Minds deals with the relationship of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). They both go through a treatment, that erases all their memories they have about each other. But in the verge of being treated Joel realises, that he doesn't want to lose his mementos: he wants to remember, so he struggles and tries to hide his love from the procedure.Almost whole movie is shown as the procedure, Joel rummages through his memories, sees flashes of things that have happened, tries to save them. On the outside we see the doctors, who are working on him.Whole point of the film is, that even thought we want to erase certain things from our mind would that really be something what we want to do? Would that take something out from us? Would we turn into someone else if our memories were taken? Maybe it's just good for us to remember. Everything.This move certainly isn't for everyone. It contains no action, juts fine acting and a very intriguing plot line. So, if action is something you want steer clear from this one, if you want something to think about, well this is for you then.\n",

To me he's a revelation in this movie. Sensitive, complex, emotive and a true match to Kate Winslet's considerable talent. This film is basically a romance, but with an intellectual twist so rare in this era of throw-away relationships. This film dares to suppose that some relationships aren't and shouldn't be so easily discarded. The idea is wonderful, the script intelligent and romantic (with a nice little subplot involving the technicians) and the execution picture perfect. I urge anyone out there like me who has been purposely avoiding Jim Carrey's work to try this one. It's so good, you can almost forget Ace Ventura...almost.\n",

      "Two months before the Oscars were awarded, I heard this movie will be one of the candidates for many awards. I haven't watch it, but the title was telling me it will be the great pleasure watching it. I knew it isn't one of the sweet love stories and couldn't wait to buy DVD and see what can show me two of my favourite actors - wonderful Kate Winslet and amazing Jim Carrey. Two months later, I was disappointed (even though I didn't watch it) seeing how there were no Golden Globes for this movie, and it won only one Oscar. None of them for Kate or Jim. This summer I finally got the opportunity to see \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". I'm a man, and men don't cry, but this time I cried. I was amazed by Jim's and Kate's performances, the story was absolutely fantastic, and this movie became my No1. Yes, I know it's a bit funny and odd being amazed by movie you didn't watch, but it happens to me very often. And when I finally spend my precious time watching that movies, I become satisfied. This time, I was more satisfied then I thought I would be. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is the best movie ever!!! I know most of you won't agree with me, but if you watch it one more time, you will see how strong and healthy it is. I'm not saying healthy only because the tears are good, I'm saying it because it could clear you mind and learn you not to make sudden decisions. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is basically the story about human nature. Made in extremely strange and, I think, experimental way, it told us how we can control our mind, but our heart will survive the changes and come out as one big winner. Mary (Kirsten Dunst) showed us it by re-falling in love with Doctor Howard. It showed us Joel and Clementine when they met again. Kate Winslet was great. She showed us one more time that she is one of the best actresses ever and I can't understand why she didn't win Oscar so far. She surely was better than Hilary Swank in \"Million Dollar Baby\". Kate was the one who lead this movie. I watched her in \"Titanic\" and were amazed by her possibilities, but this role was very hard and definitely her best. In \"Titanic\" she was a lady, but here we could see her excellent Clementine, strange impulsive girl. Jim Carrey was amazing, especially in scenes of fight against erasing Clementine from his memory. I also can't understand why he didn't win at least nomination. He's probably the best example how Academy can make terrible mistakes. I was charmed by his acting in \"Man on the Moon\", but this time he was even better. Kirsten Dunst was also very good, but Elijah Wood was the one that surprised me, pleasantly. Certainly the best technical part of this movie is camera. It was great. I've never seen such a great moves and scenes. It was like taking a part in all that's happening on the screen. Make-up was perfect. Jim Carrey looked really good; he was the perfect image of tired, devastated, depressive shy guy. Kate Winslet's hair was such a tasty detail. Two years before I couldn't imagine Kate having that colour, but when I saw it, I was stunned with surprise how good it was. And a screenplay ¬ñ wonderful. So many nice dialogues, so much subtlety, so many nice thoughts. I especially liked the conversation between Mary and Doctor Howard, about wise thoughts, when I heard what Alexander Pope said about mind and heart. \"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\" And I couldn't agree more with that. \"The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is the greatest master-piece of all time. The best movie ever seen, the best story ever written!!!\n",

      "When we reach crisis moments with someone we love, we are faced with a couple of ways to deal with it, depending on the circumstances.One way, vis a vis pessimism, is in assuming something is so broken that it isn't fixable. And so we take measures to fully complete that break. Even when this is necessary, it is still painful because there's always a little bit of self-destruction that is unavoidable. Erasing memories involve erasing little parts of ourselves as well.Another way, more in hope, is to consciously reach back and search out all the good memories, so as to recreate the once shared life based upon those genuine moments and experiences. This is intended to fuel our desire to save the sinking ship. A declaration of interdependence is drafted in one's mind, something giving evidence that the positives of the relationship well outweigh the negatives, and those negatives are seen as just part of the package.So Kaufman, et al, drew up a scenario in which both of these approaches occur within the same relationship. To bring us deep into the broken psyche of someone in this situation, we begin at the aftermath of the end (after some preliminaries), and we work backwards. Isn't that what people do when they mull over a painful split with someone they love? Working backwards every step, through the good and the bad, to survey all the pictures that were painted, the visions co-created, the inspirations drawn from each other and for each other.It's a sort of mnemonic museum at that point, but as time begins to flatten those landscapes, the walls begin to crumble, the pictures will become fractured and dirty and harder to discern. Faces are blurred. Items are missing. Memories are trodden by frantic changes in circumstances.The peculiar cinematic genius here, of course, and what makes this film a must-see, is in exactly how Kaufman and Gondry present this phenomenon. The massive, compelling centerpiece of this film is the single, vivid night of our protagonist Joel who, in the most literal sense possible, chases down his fading dreams of Clementine.Thankfully, we have a director who is masterful at cinematic flow of the quirky, so that the convoluted arrangement of memories, visions and various interspliced scenes are strung together in a complex tapestry that does not quite overwhelm our senses. We can accept this theatrical style put to new use in a truthful dream logic. For instance, Joel walks us directly from the trauma at Barnes and Nobles to reflective conversation in a neighbor's apartment, in a seamless flow (the only seam possibly being a door frame, but it's more of an incidental passage marker); lending immediacy to his confusion over that fresh experience, visually recalled within a somber dialogue. And that was just to prepare us for the spectacular night journey to come, having been foreshadowed by the series of lights turning off in the bookstore. An atypical journey, instead of events unfolding, they are folding back in on themselves. A multitude of vignettes in reverse is a very unique form of storytelling.One more point. It must be a great time to be an actor who gets to be involved in these kinds of projects. The kinds of projects I'm talking about are where a main character, as narrator and guide, take us down a certain path in the story. But then (typically within the climax of the third act) it is revealed that this path was unreliable from the start, fantasy, or deception. And so we as the audience have to reach back and reinterpret all the mannerisms and motives of at least some of the characters we think we have come to know. (Think of the Usual Suspects, where in the final series of explanations we are offered several possible alternatives, and so we have to construct several possible characters out of a single actor).So the actors in Eternal Sunshine get to act within at least two possible dimensions at the same time, always striding the possibilities that will be presented later, in a way to convince us of things we are not really supposed to be convinced of. Of course its fun to be tricked by sudden twists in the story, but the real treat is in the acting that is open to interpretation. I have no problem with this being a recent clich√© in \"edgy\" films, because it encourages deeper levels of interaction from the audience. It is one more way for a film to effectively reach out and mingle with our spotted minds.\n",

      "By now, if you are unfamiliar with the name Charlie Kaufman (in other words, if you have spent the last three years in outer space), that is undoubtedly a damn shame. Charlie Kaufman is unquestionably one of the most extraordinary and one of the (if not the) most inventive screenwriters in the game today. His previous projects, including Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, have broken cinematic formulas and expectations alike, and in doing so, both have become modern-day unparalleled masterworks. Fortunately, with his newest effort, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kaufman does not fall far from the level of innovation he emanated with his first two features. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a strikingly original story that blends both romance and memory loss like no other. It is yet another eccentric and aesthetic tale from one of Hollywood's most gifted writers that all will surely find sharp, fresh, and cognitive.Not only has Kaufman pieced together a pioneering screenplay on an often-adapted subject matter, but he has also concocted an aptly named title that has the power to place viewers in a state of surrealism and wonderment right from the get-go. The title of the picture is taken from a poem entitled \"Eloisa to Abelard\" by Alexander Pope. This historic elegy, which Kaufman also used in Being John Malkovich, directly refers to the human brain's power of recollection. Reminiscent of both Memento and 50 First Dates, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind deals with the loss of memory; however, Kaufman's script gives the frequently used topic an appetizing twist.On a train to Montauk, Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) happens to meet Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), a candid yet electric woman, who more-or-less seems like she could complete Joel in every way. The two form a relationship, and establish many happy memories together. Even so, in due time, their connection comes to a halt¬óClementine becomes bored with Joel and Joel believes Clementine is too dependent.Immediately after the breakup, Clementine chooses to have Joel erased from her memory. She travels to Lacuna Inc. ¬ñ a company that specializes in the futuristic service of memory erasure ¬ñ to seek the help of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson).Once Joel discovers that Clementine erased him from her head entirely, he reports directly to Lacuna for the very same service. However, once the Lacuna employees, Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst), start wiping out Clementine from Joel's mind, their service becomes a disservice; Joel becomes contrite and changes his mind about the procedure. Even though Joel is unconscious during the entire attempted erasure, he consciously tries to retain the memories of his love for Clementine within the walls of his own head, and attempts to hang on to at least a fragment of what they once had.There is no question about it, this Jim Carrey's finest work. He brings a clear spirited depth to the part of Joel¬ómaking Joel Jim's most stark yet most respectable character role to date. Even though Eternal Sunshine may not be one of Jim biggest money making endeavors (compared to his comedies), it certainly puts him on the path of being perceived as an actor who is capable of seriousness. At far as earning an Oscar nod for '04, because of the film's early release date and the fierce competition up for the Best Actor nominations, Jim will most likely be gypped.In addition to Carrey's career performance, the remainder of the ensemble cast fares equally as well. Kate Winslet serves up some of her best non English-accented acting as the orange-haired and sporadically veclempt Clementine. (Sorry for the Yiddish slang.) Her work here is arguably better than anything else she has done¬ówith the possible exception of her other near-astounding 2004 effort in Finding Neverland. Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are as faultless as always, and both Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood are as top-notch as expected in their respective supporting roles.With his superb use of light (or more appropriately darkness) and his watertight scene transitions, director Michel Gondry has crafted an utter joy of a film that cleverly starts out near the end and then wraps back upon itself by the conclusion. Overall, the quirky yet visual genius of Gondry combined with the warped yet brilliant mind of Charlie Kaufman has undoubtedly resulted in a beautiful and poignant romance. The manner in which Eternal Sunshine blends its romance and comedy gives the film a strong sense of undeniable individuality and makes for an overtly pleasing picture. Eternal Sunshine has the aptitude to tickle your thinking cap, sooth your sight, and hypnotize your heart. Beyond any shadow of a doubt, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind belongs in the absolute upper echelon of all that is romantic and unique.\n",

      "Joel Barish(Jim Carrey)finds out that Clementine Kruczynski(Kate Winslet) had Joel erased from her memory after a terrible break up. Breaking his heart even more, he too attempts to have his memory erased of her through this futuristic process of destroying memories. As Joel is unconscious, he remembers their relationship chronologically up to the point where they first met, realizing that he is making a mistake.Jim Carrey is known for being a smart-ass comedian and probably not considered to be a \"good\" actor. Whoever has put this label on Jim has not seen Eternel Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He proves to be an outstanding actor in this story of fate. His humor is still present, but he brings a balance to the movie, making one of the greatest films ever made. With the amazing cast of Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson, it is quite certain that the movie's acting will be great and it was. The audience feels every effect needed to make this movie an emotional roller coaster. The moods strike the viewer with a vast intensity of realism and relation to certain portions. The writing shows to great also with incredible conversations about fate and love. Overall, this movie is absolutely flawless and will definitely be considered a modern classic. It is amazing in every aspect and is kind of a tear-jerker.I highly recommend this movie.\n",

      "The first time I rented this movie, I think I turned it on for five minutes and then never finished watching it. I rented it a few months later because there was nothing left in the video store. Boy, I SURE am glad I actually watched it this time. After watching it I fell in love with it. Not too long after I ended up buying it on DVD. This movie truly is a treasure. This movie is unique. They are absolutely incredible. I'm not sure what about this movie struck me, but I have watched it dozens of times and never gotten tired of it yet. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are amazing. The chemistry these two have is undeniable and it shines throughout the whole movie. My favorite movie.\n",

      "Well. What to say about this movie. I never got the chance to view it up until recently, almost a year after its release. Finally, when I saw it I just thought it was a shear masterpiece.Jim Carrey, in what I believe was his most serious and dramatic role in any of his films, was amazing. He, along with Kate Winslet were perfect for their roles. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) runs through all of his memories with his former girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) with intentions to erase his memory of her. I think the director, Michel Gondry portrayed Carrey's sense of holding on and confusion. I loved how the script was laid out. The movie flowed very well.If you're looking for a movie to watch for years to come, this is your movie. It's simply a masterpiece. I highly recommend you purchase this movie on DVD asap. You will not be disappointed.\n",

      "I am not a monstrous fan of any actor in the movie, now am I a huge fan of Charlie Kaufman (until now) or the director. What I can say is that the combination of love, music, interesting camera work, and amazing effects combine to make what is, in a word, \"beautiful.\" There is no other movie like it, I can honestly say. Anyone who enjoys typical chick flicks will definitely find this one a little challenging to grip at first, but the reward of using your mind and seeing this film as an aesthetic experience rather than a movie will leave you with an incredibly invigorating and satisfying love story that will reinvent your appreciation for artistic film-making.\n",
      "1223\n",
      "This movie was a little confusing at first, and then about half-way through everything made sense and an entertaining, worthwhile movie suddenly became profound and very poignant. Kate Winslet was charming and affecting, and even Jim Carrey was all right, though I generally don't like him. All the acting was superb, and the dialog witty and the movie had a nice progression. Not a good date movie, as after viewing, I found myself delving deep into my own memories and questioning the turning points in my life. It's intelligent and odd, but likable, and I think even those who stray from the independent or quirky style films will find a place in their heart for this one.\n",

      "I'm happy to say that I came into 'Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind' with absolutely no idea what to expect. Although it had been out for at least a year and quite a while on DVD, I, well, took about a year off watching movies completely. So now I'm playing catch-up, and I heard people talking ecstatically about this movie, so I took the plunge, even though I'm not the biggest Jim Carrey fan in the world. I knew it had to do with memory loss? Or something. So, I came in, again with no real expectations.Well, I have to say, I haven't enjoyed a movie as imaginative a movie in a long time. Jim Carrey plays a sad sack of a man who meets the girl of his dreams (literally ha ha!). When she erases any memory of him using a controversial procedure, he gets the procedure done too, as he doesn't want to go through the pain of knowing he was in love with her and her not knowing a thing (you're following me? Good). Only, there are complications, when the girl of his dreams, doesn't, um, want to erase herself from his dreams. And neither does he. It's a hell of a tricky story, and I don't know where the heck Charlie Kaufman gets his stories from, but he deserved every ingot of god that was in the Oscar for that screenplay. Along with Carrey, it also stars Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst (who is great here). Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and Elijah Wood, who I gotta say, is the fastest actor ever NOT to get typecast, as he's so funny here.\n",

      "After eighty years of cinema, the film industry is running out of original ideas. There seem to be more and more remakes of old films, or recycled ideas, everyday. I find this loss of originality to be quite depressing. That's why I'm overjoyed to find that there is still some creativity in Hollywood today. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a perfect example.Jim Carrey stars as Joel, a man who one day discovers that his lover, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had him erased from her memory after their relationship has gone over the edge. In retaliation Joel decides to have his memory erased as well, but it's only through doing so that he realizes all the good times they had together.Charlie Kaufman is one of Hollywood's most important writers, and certainly one of its best living screenwriters. Before bringing us \"Eternal Sunshine\", he's written such greats as \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\". I feel happy knowing that there is still such a thing as a clever script nowadays.One of the things that leads this movie is the cast. If ever I had any doubts about Jim Carrey's acting talents, they were cleared up after this movie. Mr. Carrey is excellent, and thanks to his performance I really sympathized with his character. Kate Winslet is also terrific. These two are both equally deserving of an Academy Award nomination. Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Thomas Jay Ryan play in supporting roles.At the director's helm is Michel Gondry, and he knows how to steer this ship. Jon Brion's emotional score really adds to the film.I am proud to declare \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" as my pick for the best film of 2004. This is one of the greatest films of recent years, and in my opinion one of the very best films made. \"Eternal Sunshine\" truly is a spotless film.\n",

      "One of the most original films i have seen in years.Its heartwarming yet turbulent race through the film always keeps you on your toes and you do have to think about it.From the whole way through the film you can relate to Carrey as more than a rubber faced comedian and as a genuine actor, if you have to see this film it must be to see a performance by Carrey that truly rivals many Oscar winners.At no point during the film did i feel that i was bored or felt like stopping it, i got dragged in and if you could only see one film then i would place this at the topI would recommend this film to anyone and everyone as IMO it was one of the best films i have seen in years which everyone should see and love.\n",

I don't want to spoil it but the actors were SO convincing. They made you feel as if they were really going through all these experience. It felt like I was really watching someone else's life. It was THAT real. Jim Carey and Kate Winslet were amazing in these roles. I believe this to be Jim Carey's and Kate Winslet's best dramatic performance by far. I'm not comparing them to any other actors because they simply put themselves in their own category. Jim Carey will soon be realized by all to not just be a great comedian but a great dramatic actor. Buying this movie right now.\n",

I was talking with my father, who said about the move: \"It's not a piece of art\", but couldn't even say what a piece of art was for him.It was without question one of last year's best films, and the cult audience loved it; but I'm not willing to expand on that. But I'm willing to say how disappointed I am because Hollywood keeps underestimating the very best they have in their hands. Just because Jim Carrey stars in the film, as he starred in one of my favorite movies, the underrated \"The Truman Show\"; or underrated movies like another of my favorites, \"Almost Famous\"¬Ö",
      "There's a long list of underrated films; Michel Gondry's feature is definitely in that list.When you think of it, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is not just wholeness as a movie, but for all the persons involved in the project. From the top; if you think about Michel Gondry's work as a video director, and his early full-length projects, this is the best he has achieved; he's starting from now on. He did a correct work in \"Human Nature\", but I didn't think his direction was at Kaufman's script level. But now it's a different thing. It's the correct commitment with team working one of the reasons that make this movie great. And Kaufman, well¬Ö",
      "I know we've been disappointed because he hasn't been recognized, but the way I see it, this is not a merciful Oscar¬Ö",
      "This is the best he has written (although I admit I haven't seen \"Being John Malkovich)! I know Kate Winslet (Clementine) is one of the best actresses working today. She never disappoints and always adds personality to her roles, but has never been recognized for that. However, surpassing her remembered Rose (\"Titanic\"), she confronts a much complex role; deeper and flexible. And she does it as perfectly as she has always done it, and even better than her \"forgotten by me as I watched her performance in this movie\" Rose. Jim Carrey (Joel) is one of my favorite actors, and he has built a spectacular career. As it happened to me with Adam Sandler and his performance in \"Spanglish\" (although it's not exactly the same situation); it has happened with Jim Carrey playing dramatic roles. I'm in love with both of his sides as an actor; comedy and drama. \"Liar, Liar\" is my favorite comedy, and I think Jim Carrey is great in it. But then, he can make you cry; he's that great actor, and while he won't be recognized for it, leaving behind \"Man on the moon\", \"The Majestic\" and even \"The Truman Show\"; Carrey has arrived at his best dramatic performance. I don't want to reiterate too much in these circumstances, but it's another voice, another innocent and warm look; magic in his movements: \"I could die here, Clem; I'm exactly where I wanna be\". This and many other phrases written in another thought-provoking, messing with human mind and conscience, wise realistic screenplay from Charlie Kaufman.With Tom Wilkinson (Howard) in his wonder years, Kirsten Dunst (Mary) shining as I hadn't seen her since \"Crazy/Beautiful\", Elijah Wood (Patrick) in his career's most calmed and natural performance, and another amazing interpretation in his own territory of independent cinema by the grand Mark Ruffalo (Stan); wholeness in a movie.

Although it is still a romance, the story is unusual, and the way it is told is also very unusual. The way the film seems to introduce an element of fantasy, as we sometimes are inside the mind of the characters, looking at memories of each other, and the way they struggle to avoid being erased from each other's mind. I loved it. This is also an opportunity to watch Jim Carrey show that he is a great actor, although we usually associate him with movies like Dumb & Dumber, Liar Liar, Ace Ventura, etc.A very interesting love story that is very well told...\n",

Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey had such an adorable, sad, loving, and wonderful chemistry. At the end, i was about to break. what i loved most about the movie was its creativeness, not trying to ruin the one of the greatest scenes of movies but, oh my gosh it was just such good directing, and dialogue, and EVERYTHING. The little things you notice but not too well are fantastic. And the way the story is told is amazing and very clever. oh and did i mention this movie was bursting with emotion? some words were hard to hear so i suggest watching this movie with subtitles, because once you get everything they say, you'll understand the movie a lot more. Its not the movies fault because some of the dialogue has to be low to make it be felt out. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies and i have seen a lot. almost all of IMDb top 15.

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind you would say is a comedy, but to me just as much a drama. I actually had more sorrow than laughter in this movie, especially from the lead parts. I am not going to go into huge detail into what the plot is about. I am just going to say that this is a romantic comedy that really you should find in the art-house section at your local video store.It is mainly about a man and a woman who happen to fall in love one day, and suddenly the woman erases all memories of her times with him and now the man has to go on this big quest to win her over.The movie is fun to watch, as we see time travel sequences constantly and some supernatural happenings as well. I actually quite forget most of the movie, not because it was boring or anything, but because I really couldn't understand it myself. You see, I have a hard time understanding most twists that occur in movies.The acting is superb, with Jim Carrey playing his part excellently, usually stealing scenes from Kate Winslet who did a decent job too. Co-stars Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson as the doctor conducting the procedures to erase the woman's memories are all solid in their roles, but as I said, Jim Carrey is a standout.This is not the type of movie I'd go out and buy, but I just can't get past the originality of it. There is nothing more you could want out of this if you are into these kind of movies.\n",

      "Some films reveal the inner workings of relationships that ring true and leave clich√© at the door - such as Eternal Sunshine ES. First, this is a well acted film, not the pet detective, or dark cable guy Carey, but truly a serious performance by Carrey and Winslet. The film explore the underbelly of relationships, the insecurities, as well as those beautiful memories that are reminiscent of different romantic - and serious moments in my emotional development. I watched the film with my wife of 15 years, and the film had the same effect on each of us.Compared to other films where figuring out which way is up due to a lack of memory, such as Momento, this movie leaves the viewer with a warm feeling about the human condition. I would recommend the film as a date movie, for a couple in their early twenties or older.I would also recommend the film to science fiction film fans, who appreciate seamless technologies into today's time line, without the gloss and action of Total Recall - which uses a similar \"technology\" as the driving force in the movie.Second, the ending of the movie may have been shorter if this was a French film, leaving more to the imagination, but as in most American movies, or versions of European productions, it seems we Americans need to have things spelled out for us. But after the movie was completed, the ending did make some points that were fairly key to the movie. But this was not a movie with a sappy ending, either.\n",

A very different character for Jim Carrey to play but he played the role very,very believable. And- like he always does,with brilliance! He showed once again in \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\"what brilliant performer he is and that he is easily capable of playing different characters.If I think about \"Man On The Moon\",\"The Truman Show\",\"The Mask\",\"The Grinch\"...(I don't want mentioned all of his films) they all different.But not that he \"plays\" different characters,no,he plays them believable... This and his ability of playing different characters make him unique from others...I believe that everybody who watch this movie can learn something from it. I give him a 10!!

A good movie should entertain, and a great movie should make you think and reflect on your own life while entertaining you.

      "What if your girl (by some kind of technical advances) would erase you from her mind? What if you (in revenge) would do the same? This is the starting point for a crazy story made by french director Michekl Condry and co-written with by Charlie Kaufman (they had previously worked together in that disaster called \"Human Nature\"). As in most o Kaufman's scripts you can't figure out if it is such a complex and perfect engine or only some pages stapled at random. Anyway, this time he made it! The moral is quite clear: nobody's perfect, nor even the love of your life. Her/his defects are his/her virtues as well; and if you kill your couple in your head you're killing yourself too. When relationships get so intense then your couple is part of you and you're part of your couple.Kaufman and Gondry make us quickly identify with the main character as his memories are being erased (and with them his own world, his present and his future). They force us to fall in love with the girlfriend, played by the so inspired (and beautiful) Kate Winslet; they let us understand why that man is in love with that woman, how does it hurt to lose her, and how impossible is to try to replace your soul-mate. Jim Carrey, the long-suffering boyfriend, plays his most sober and austere character, it seems like it is a part specially written for him (though it is a dramatic character, he needs to resort to that hysterical clown inside him in a few sequences). Guest-starrings are not that bad , but they're nothing but filling (Hollywood stars-filling: Dunst, Wood...).So \"Eternal Sunshine...\" is quite confusing, the sense of narration is completely lost here (as in most of Kaufman's works). But that's why it is so amusing. Because of its nonsense, because of the absurd of it all: the laughing, the tenderness, the tears... No one will be indifferent about this movie: some will disconnect after 5 minutes, and some will ask for more and more, even though they now exactly how the story is gonna end. A little jewel from latest (almost)independant American cinema.PD: Three hurrays for Spanish movies titles translators. They called this movie \"Forget About Me\"... That's it boys! In your face!

      "when i saw this movie, i loved it. at first glance, it's a light, maybe boring romantic comedy. it's about a man named joel and a woman, Clementina, who likes to switch up her hair colour. they meet and start dating, but when they break up, Clementina decides to have him permanently erased from her mind so she won't have to live with the pain of missing him. joel decides to do the same in revenge, but while the operation is being done he realizes how much he wants to hold on to her. it's a pretty original idea actually compared to most romantic comedy things today. jim carrey's great as a shy sort of guy. in general he plays the loud, annoying funny characters, but here he switches the approach to nice and timid. it's a nice change and he portrays his character well. i think he put in a great performance.some parts are definitely amusing, and it runs deep when commenting on love and how it can surprise people. but it's too bad that it doesn't really work for people who don't get touched by these sorts of dramas. just a word of caution there.i think it's a great movie for thought, if not a really great movie for laughs on a Friday night out with a crowd. definitely good for a quiet evening at home. i'd recommend it for sure: one of my faves!\n",

      "I went into this movie with very high expectations, and I left the theatre with immense satisfaction. This film was all I hoped it to be and more. It was so refreshing to finally see a film that was completely original and unique; one that didn't feel the need to follow a simple formula. Charlie Kaufman's dialogue is bold and realistic, two things that can make a film more plausible and enjoyable. Jim Carrey gives the performance of his career while portraying Joel, an ordinary man that falls in love with the outgoing (and sometimes outspoken) Clementine (Kate Winslet). When their relationship takes a turn for the worst, Clementine makes a trip to Lacuna Inc., a place that specializes in erasing bad memories. When Joel finds out that Clementine has had this procedure done, he decides to as well. However, as the procedure commences, and Joel revisits all of his memories of Clementine, he begins to realize that their relationship wasn't as bad as it seemed.Thoughtful and emotional, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a bittersweet romance that won't disappoint. One of the best films of 2004.\n",

      "This movie touched me. I felt like it was so real, and so honest. How many times have I wished I could erase someone only to be left with an empty void left in its place? Too many, and after seeing this movie, I don't think I'll ever wish that again because any relationship is worth remembering. Even if it has its low points, the way a person makes you feel can't be erased. The scents you have smelled, the songs you've heard, the signs and places you've seen, these are all gifts and anybody is lucky to experience being in love. This movie is on my mind for some reason,I can't get it out of my head. I wish it would have gone on for hours,and I would love to see Jim and Kate in another original movie. Anyways, thanks for this movie. I really believe it has changed my outlook and changed the way I feel about bad memories.\n",

      "You have to give it to Charlie Kauffman, his scripts are very, very original, almost as if he is trying to outsmart himself (Adaptation, Being John Malkovic, and now Sunshine...), however they always have this quality of leaving you a bit empty, because he always starts so strong maybe his endings lose a lot of the punch, or he just does not want to deliver one. In any case, this is a good movie. The acting is superb, Carey and Whinslet have a perfect chemistry here, and although not much is shown, much is perceived. I think that looking at 50% of the audience giving this movie a 10 is overrating it. What are you going to leave for the Godfather, or the Quiet American? 7/10\n",

      "Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett star in this unique film, as two people who meet and slowly fall in love. However the relationship is somewhat rocky, and slowly begins to deteriorate. After one particularly nasty row, Winslett decides to have Carrey erased from her memory.Amazingly it turns out that there exists a procedure that allows her to do just that, even though everything else points to the film being set in the present day. The futuristic machines that facilitate Carrey and Winslett's memory loss seem somewhat out of place in this thoughtful drama about the pitfalls of relationships, and the film seems intent on enlightening us about how the memory-wiping technology works. Better they had glossed over this, and allowed it to remain a mystery.The film also devotes some time to examining the lives of the people who carry out the procedure, who to be honest are pretty incidental to the main plot. These sections aren't particularly enlightening, as they just seem to mirror the problems that Carrey and Winslett are experiencing.Carrey is a revelation in this film, showing that he is capable of far more than just energetic mugging in dubious comedy vehicles, and gets his career firmly back on track, while Winslett finally puts Titanic behind her, delivering an assured performance.Overall this is a thoroughly absorbing and original work, which invokes bizarre technology, and is so bonkers at times that you occasionally forget that it's basically a simple film about relationships. It's superbly thought provoking, and only slightly marred by its tendency towards science fiction.\n",

      "This movie was very original, which is why I thought it was OK. I didn't think the concept was anything that great though. It's basically a romance. But instead of showing the two meeting and falling for each other in the conventional way, it's all shown in memories as they are being erased. In the film, there is technology that can erase memories. Joel learns his ex-girlfriend, Clemetine, had him erased, so he goes to have the same procedure done to him. But, during the procedure, part of him doesn't want to lose all the memories. So, most of the latter part of the film shows things that Joel and Clementine did together. And once Joel realizes he doesn't want her erased he begins dragging Clementine throughout his memories and trying to hide her. It's rather weird, but the way it's shown makes sense.The side plot involves the employees from the memory erasing place. Mary finds out something about her and the doctor and it changes the way she feels about the procedure. And somehow Joel and Clementine meet again after their memories were erased and start hanging out together. Then each gets an interesting piece of mail that leads to the conclusion.I'm not sure why Kate Winslet received so many acting nominations. I didn't think any of the actors did anything exceptional.FINAL VERDICT: I give it props for originality, but it's not a great story. But, I do recommend it if you want to see something new.\n",

      "In mysteries like Eternal Sunshine, The Matrix, Mulholland Dr., the mystery isn't only who-really-dunit, but also who's real; the mystery isn't the \"story\" but how the story was portrayed (is all or part a dream, a vision, a memory, a program). Some of these stories move dangerously close to the childish \"it was all a dream\" resolution. Eternal Sunshine doesn't do that, but we have to deal with (I think): what he's really seeing, what he's imagining, what he's forgetting, what he's thinking while forgetting, what's happening to him while he's forgetting, what's happening to others, what happens after the forgetting. And it's not obvious which is which, or when. Maybe the point is that thinking something can make it so. I guess anything is OK, as long as it's entertaining.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is one of the more overrated films of the past year. At best, one may say that the concept and screenplay are \"clever.\" But the idea of remapping memory and the unethical human erasers removing the painful experiences was a shallow one. It is unfortunate that two fine performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Wislet were wasted in this film. The best scene was their initial meeting where we actually saw a believable and interesting relationship unfold. In the combination of Winslet's quirky character and the mild-mannered Carrey, I was reminded of a much superior film and screenplay in \"The Sterile Cuckoo.\" With the outstanding dialogue and unforgettable performance of Liza Minnelli, the film actually shed light on human relationships and the emotional pain of breakups. By contrast, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" was no more than a glorified gimmick. The film's title comes from the English poet Alexander Pope. But a better tagline for this film would be Shakespeare's image of \"weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable.\"\n",

And again and again he proves that he is one of the best actors of today. I really find it amazing that he started as a comedy actor and proved himself of being a great drama actor.

      "This film must be the ultimate example of the \"Emperor has no clothes\" syndrome, not to mention the combined degeneration of both Hollywood and the general movie-going public.To start this naked but well-dressed festival, we have two lovers (Carrey and Winslet) with absolutely no on screen chemistry. The plot thickens -- lots of artsy photography with little substance (ala \"The Cell\" or \"Vanilla Sky\"), and it continues its well-plotted plotlessness with, well, no real plot to speak of.The silliness continues with soap-opera intensity, as we get a bizarre love triangle between the memory doctor and Kirsten Dunst, as well as Winslet and several servings of Sum Yung Guy.The film ends with a deep examination of the shallow question: \"Is it better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all?\" A pointless question if there ever was one, as one has either loved or not loved, and therefore need not inquire.Abstract art is often accused of being pointless and artless, a false accusation if there ever was one -- there's talented abstract art, and untalented abstract art, and it's not hard to pick which is which if you have any sort of eye for talent. In the same vein, there are \"arty\" films that are truly artistic, as well as pretentious vehicles designed to make money and help shallow people weep crocodile tears of joy at the sheer depth of it all. Unfortunately, ESOTSM is of the latter category.Can we dress the big fat guy wearing the crown now?\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is, if nothing else, (and it is a ton of other things), inventive.The premise: What if one could erase another from one's memories? In \"Eternal...\" the erasees are two halves of a couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), who have decided to call it quits, and then some. Their addenda are tacked on via the help of a small outfit, Lacuna, Inc. (\"lacuna\" defined: a blank space; a missing portion in a text, etc.), that is presided over by a doctor who claims that with his technological assistance one can successfully eradicate one's memories of another. This is a novel claim, no doubt, and for the doctor's patients, if the procedure works, a probable godsend, enabling his \"cured\" patients to go forward after break-ups, divorces, etc., without the usual grieving, second thoughts, and lamentations.In \"Eternal...\" Joel discovers that Clementine has undergone the procedure when he finds a piece of mail from Lacuna, Inc. To verify the information on that correspondence he goes to Clementine's work place to confront her. Much to his dismay, she looks at him with a blank face, showing no indicator that she has ever seen him before. She even smooches her new (old?) boyfriend while talking to Joel. He then decides to pursue the same path as Clementine, though his decision to undergo the procedure is seemingly based on vindication: to get back at Clementine for erasing him. This is a somewhat relevant point because I think that Joel's eventual decision to reverse the procedure has much to do with his realization that his motives are mean-spirited. From what we see of him, he's not that kind of guy. Eccentric and introverted, yes, vengeful and hateful, no.Does his attempt to reverse the procedure and get back Clementine work? By movie's end, one isn't quite sure. Joel and Clementine seem to be on the road to reconciliation, but, as neither has truly shown any significant change (one's \"promise to change\" being nothing but hot air and fantasy), one wonders whether or not they will fall right back into the rut that derailed their course in the first (second?) place.But, by movie's end, and at various points throughout, one also isn't quite sure as to exactly who erased who first, Joel or Clementine, or whether or not they have done so more than once. This is a film--think \"Memento\"--that compels you to pay attention, for its chronology perpetually folds back within itself. At times that is most amusing, yet, in some other instances it is confusing.As with \"Adaptation\" and \"Being John Malkovich,\" the story tends to overshadow the actors, as keeping up with its chronological complexities compels one to remain acutely attentive. As such, Carrey and Winslet, who play quirky, Long Island bohemians (minus the \"LawnGuyLand\" accents, by the way) are sublimated to playing supporting roles, in effect, serving merely as players forever moved back and forth in time to suit the tale. Sure enough, though I've yet to read any other review, that Carrey and Winslet, both Hollywood A-list actors, opted to take these \"second fiddle\" roles will summon forth \"best performance of their career\" reviews aplenty. But, overly, neither does much as the story plays the lead role.Co-starring with the lead is director Michel Condry. His brilliant and apt use of special effects provides for many amazing sequences, especially those depicting Joel and Clementine racing ahead within Joel's sub-conscious visions and vistas, his rapidly erasing memory of things causing for the disintegration of landscapes behind the fleeing protagonists. Picture yourself walking just ahead of a sweeping tide of water that is obliterating a city of sandcastles, leaving nothing in its wake but a white wash.In one hilarious sequence, we see Joel as an adult kid, cowering beneath a kitchen table, with a morphed Clementine (in this memory, she plays his mother, and gives kudos to the style of that earlier time: the 70s) trying to talk him through his troublesome memory and back onto the path to his salvation. In other sequences, Condry evokes living double-images, with present-time Joel walking and wading about in his memories. Eye candy deluxe, the kind of visual stuff that drops your jaw down like a toaster oven door: wow!! In totality, \"Eternal...\" is a solid B+ film, and worth a second viewing if for no other reason than to try to get the facts straight. Its drawbacks: the story runs aground at times, fetching to keep up its loony plot and pace; and the presence of Kirsten Durst, the living embodiment of The Peter Principle, here, once again, miscast and over-matched by both story and supporting cast. Thin as a swizzle stick and less compelling than a detergent ad, her 15 minutes are exhausted.\n",

      "This film is often misunderstood so my review may seem unusual. Overall I enjoyed this movie.Joel (Jim Carrey) pops pills two or three times in the film. I believe he is a psychiatric patient, for example suffering from a personality disorder. This is NOT a science fiction film about mind erasing machines, or a romance film exploring the good and bad of relationships. Clementine is imaginary, as is Lacuna. One episode of pill-popping is accompanied by strange music and paranoia, so the pills are not exactly vitamins!The memorabilia Joel has collected contain no evidence that he and Clementine were in a real relationship. There are no photos of the two of them together; rather, the photos of Kate on her own, and the crazy sketches of the couple, seem to be the belongings of a mad stalker. Kate and Joel even have a casual conversation about stalking early in the film.My interpretation of Eternal Sunshine as an exploration of psychosis runs as follows. A few years before the film begins, Joel is an extreme introvert dating a woman called Naomi. His mental instabilities increase and one day at a Montauk beach party, missing Naomi and sitting quietly away from everyone, he even imagines meeting another person, Clementine. This girl is probably based on a (real) Barnes & Noble employee he had seen earlier. She seems real enough to him that Joel breaks up with his girlfriend Naomi.Joel's psychiatrist (Dr. Howard Mierzwiak) prescribes medication to return him to normal. Deep down, part of Joel rebels against this, since a return to normal would necessarily strip him of the abnormal life he has come to lead (characterised in part by a fictitious relationship with 'Clementine').The doctor's drugs appear to Joel as a mind-erasing 'machine', which can attack him at any moment (we see scenes of the machine in his doctor's office, in the street, and especially in his bed where he likes to spend a lot of time, being an introvert). The machine is just Joel's active imagination making tangible something he doesn't quite understand. The sick part of Joel wants to fight back, so he tries to entrench Clementine in his memory - witness the scenes where she runs through his childhood.Eventually the drugs work, and Clementine is repressed. Her 'dying' words are 'meet me in Montauk', the place he first imagined her (Montauk is an anagram of 'nut amok', interestingly. Probably just a coincidence...). Joel gets back together with Naomi (this is most evident from one of the deleted scenes, where he is calling Naomi as her reinstated boyfriend) and life is normal again.Then one day for a reason unknown to him at the time (perhaps he had skipped his medication that day), he plays hooky on work and takes the train to Montauk. The rediscovery of Clementine is not rapid or obvious; but by the end of the day their relationship is re-established. (In a deleted scene, Joel then calls Naomi and breaks up with her for the second time.) His personality disorder is back in full swing. He even remembers the earlier episode of 'mind erasure' (success with the medication) via an audio tape (again a product of his imagination, in his search for tangibility) and is repulsed that he let the erasure happen.Where did the name Lacuna come from? In one of the first scenes of the film, Joel happens to look at his neighbour's mail, and feeling paranoid at that moment, thinks that the return address (\"Lacuna\") might represent something significant. Later he works the name into his explanations of what is going on in his head.Does my interpretation sound far-fetched? Well, take the example of Stan and Mary jumping half-naked on their patient's bed: I believe it is more credible to interpret that as a figment of Joel's mind, rather than the truth.markebden@hotmail.com\n",

      "My best picture of 2004 is a love story in reverse as a man attempts to erase his lover. As with Memento, this movie would work backwards, forwards, and sideways. It is an extremely well written character piece with a lot of wit and intelligence about how some things can't be erased. Joel and Clem, well played by Jim Carrey(snubbed again by Oscar) and Kate Winslet, are two full, distinct characters. Joel is a completely average man with nothing to lose who sees only the flaws in himself. Clem is seemingly the opposite, a lively, one of a kind woman who ignores or drowns what is wrong with herself. One of the many great aspects of this movie is the idea that there are little things that we say and do that expose us more than we could ever imagine, that are only recognized in hindsight. These two people, who seem so different, are really two sides of the same coin when you examine them more closely. Clem becomes more like Joel as he attempts to be more like her. This pegs the idea that everyone is in a state of flux with certain characteristics emerging and receding at will. Then, there is the oily Patrick, who uses Joel's memories to seduce Clem. Who hasn't thought, when they liked a girl or a guy who was with someone, that if they could just do what that person does, that they could be the one? I know I have thought that before. The ending is amazing. Unlike other romantic films which tend to make a union seem so easy, this movie's ending isn't full of hope, but it is completely natural ending for this shaky couple. This script is nothing short of mind boggling in it's depth and is brought to vivid life by the stellar cast. I wasn't a big fan of Being John Malcovich or Human Nature, but I was intrigued by Adaptation and I am won over by Charlie Kaufman with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I can't wait to see what he will come up with next.\n",

      "This was a very unique film, different from every other movies I ever watched. The story and its characters were extremely complex, but the director presented it in a way that was clear and easy for everyone to understand. The love and hate Clementine and Joel feel for each other was visually portrayed through the movie when Clem decides to erase her memory of Joel. As Joel discovers this fact and does the same thing out of spite, the movie begins its story. The sequence is not always easy to see, but it is not very confusing at all if you pay attention. Joel's memories are repeated by flashbacks and current happenings at the same time. The audience awaits with expectations as to how things will conclude between Joel and Clem.Again, a most bizarre film, but great in all its contents. Excellent for moviegoers who want to try a new genre.\n",

Just to hate it again and so on.There are some ups and downs throughout the movie, but just bear with it because it all comes together in a very nice way. I just wish that it could feel a little more realistic. I guess that the subject of the movie is something that we all have been thinking about a few times. At least everyone that ever has been in love.This is not a movie you should see if you have lived a sheltered life without any troubles or broken hearts. You have to have something to relate to in order to understand the feelings behind every occurrence.Oh and, I didn't expect this from Jim Carrey, but this actually is a decent performance without all the overacting and yelling.\n",

      "In the modern world, we've come to rely on technology as a means of deadening our pain and mitigating the unpleasant realities of our lives. We medicate ourselves to avoid both physical and psychological suffering, confident in the belief that the elimination of all sorrow and discomfort will somehow lead to happiness. But what would happen if someday we developed the technology to systematically wipe from our minds the memories of a person with whom we fell out of love or who fell out of love with us? Given the choice, which would we rather have, a painful memory of a failed relationship or no memory of that relationship at all? It's not an easy question to answer for, after all, don't sadness and pain play every bit as vital a role as happiness and joy in defining who we are as human beings? Don't we need those low points to make the high points that much more meaningful and real? These are just some of the questions posed by \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, \" a romance-cum-science-fiction tale that is yet another demanding, provocative brainchild of Charlie Kaufman, the man responsible for \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation.\" In \"Eternal Sunshine,\" Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a buttoned-up, play-by-the-rules stuffed shirt, ground down by routine and unsuccessful in the ways of love, who meets and falls head over heels for Clementine (Kate Winslet), a high-flying free spirit who opens up new vistas of experience for the nervous, unadventurous young man. However, if it is true that opposites do indeed attract, they also have the power to repel, and Joel and Joel and Clementine soon find themselves drifting apart over their many innate differences. In fact, they are drifting so far apart that Celementine has decided to undergo a medical procedure that will effectively erase all traces of Joel from her memory. When a heartbroken Joel learns that she has done this, he retaliates by doing the same with his memories of her. The vast majority of the film takes place in Joel's jumbled mind as he is undergoing the procedure to nullify his one true love - and regretting his decision halfway through.The synopsis for this movie fails to do justice to the sheer brilliance of both the concept and the execution, as we are taken through a cascading cavalcade of reality and fantasy, memories and recollections, all highly revelatory of the relationship between these two people. The movie is like a glorious kaleidoscope in which the writer and director, Michel Gondry, continually twist the picture in such a way that we never know what the next image or concept will be, yet with their hands so firmly placed on the instrument that we always know where we are at all times. Even if we don't always understand every single scene or image at the moment we are seeing it, we know that it will all make sense once the full scenario has played itself put. If \"Eternal Sunshine\" reminds us of any one movie, it is most likely Stanley Donen's \"Two For the Road,\" that great 1967 film starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney that also used an ingenious structure of interlocking time periods and events to show us the growth and disintegration of a romantic relationship. \"Two For the Road\" did it while operating solely on the level of conscious reality; now, Kaufman, by delving into the subconscious world of half-remembered incidents and ephemeral dreams, ratchets up the concept a notch or two higher. Even though \"Eternal Sunshine\" keeps shifting the planes of its reality, the audience never loses its bearings for a single moment.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have never been better than they are here, creating characters who are compelling, likable and utterly believable as they make their way through this convoluted but wonderfully challenging maze of a screenplay. It's amazing how believable and touching Carrey and Winslet manage to be in the midst of all this seeming disorder. They root the film in the human reality all fantasies need to be compelling.Towards the end, as the film brings all its disparate elements together on a single plane of reality, the movie asks us to ponder yet another difficult and challenging question: is it possible for two people in a failed relationship to drift apart for awhile, then reunite successfully if they go into the renewed relationship fully cognizant of those elements that drove them apart the first time around? It is just one of the many intriguing ideas to consider in this brilliant, creative and thoroughly fascinating film.As with Kaufman's previous cinematic mindbenders, \"Eternal Sunshine\" occasionally feels a bit too cute and a bit too clever for its own good. However, this film suffers less from this malady and feels to be more of a piece than his earlier works. With a Kaufman film - and with \"Eternal Sunshine\" in particular - we know we're getting something original, unique and intellectually demanding, which is far from the normal state of affairs when it comes to mainstream American movie-making. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a film for the ages.\n",

The direction of originality that this film portrays is excellent. I was glued to my screen the whole time not wanting to see the ending. During the first part of the movie it did seem a little hard to follow though. After a while though I was able to grasp the concept... or at least I thought so. This is definitely a date movie to bring your someone special to watch with as it will end up being the next romance movie of our time ranking with those infamous titles as \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"Casablanca\".\n",

      "At last, a film that shows Jim Carey CAN play it subtle and very convincingly. I always knew that under the clown persona he could act believably. Nice one Jim, act more non-gimp roles, you do it well! I was recommended this film by friends but resisted because of Carey's headline role... What a pleasant, different (and touching) surprise this film is. Like all Kaufman scripted films, a second viewing is essential to truly appreciate the direction it goes in.The soundtrack is lovely, reminded me of American Beauty in that it's quite subtle but would make a completely different film with its absence. Carey and Winslet's most memorable and moving scenes involve a subtle background by Jon Brion, very well scored.Jim Carey and Kate Winslet both play against type and do a great job. The fact that they are so different from each other does strain at the would-they-really-be-a-couple boundaries, but it doesn't matter. The film is so charming that the relationship between the leads plays only a part in the bigger picture. It's the tone and atmosphere of the film as a whole that makes this picture so warm, quirky and endearing. The director should be applauded here.The supporting cast does an excellent job... Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood dismiss the pressures of mega-stardom (Spider-Man and Lord Of The Rings) to add to the tone. Wood is such a sad sleaze-bag that thinks nothing of stealing an identity (\"I stole her panties\"), excellent! Dunst is great at playing it babbling-stoned, and as a younger mortal with an infatuation on a wiser, older guy (Tom Wilkinson is great too). Very true and believable...High points... The elephant parade (with Kirsten Dunst's Pope monologue - short, just in the right place hence film perfection), Cary and Winslet \"We're playing\", \"He's trying to kill me\", and of course \"Meet me in Montogue\" (+ Jon Brion music) ...The Low-ish Points: Carey almost hitting \"gimp\" routine with the child recreation (unnecessary)... but saved by Winslet's hilarious \"this is my crotch\" response.Big surprise. This was recommended by friends who know I detest Carey's \"comedy\" acts. Anybody who has seen a relationship end but later looks back on it affectionately will get something out of this.Most surprising film of the last few years in that when I saw the \"Carey\" sleeve on the DVD rack, I reckoned on a stupid over-the-top \"comedy\", but was rewarded with a smart, moving and thoughtful relationship driven film.One to watch on your own late at night...

Kate Winslet also did a great acting job as a free spirit. I have to say it is also probably the best love story to come out in... who knows how long.

The idea that one's bad memories can be erased is enough seed of an idea from which to harvest comic material for a small miniseries, and this movie is like the highlights all scrunched into 2 hours. The action is non-stop, the suspense is ever-present, the cinematography is so fresh, and the acting is purely enthralling. You will find yourself so captured by the story that you will forget that you are watching a movie. Movies like this take our subconscious spirits on a joy ride and leave the rest of us to try and catch up. The catching up only comes well after the movie is over, as the smiles take days to wear off. After watching this movie, I immediately KNEW that it was in my top 25 of all time, and that it would stay there forever.

      "The author of the story has excellent insight into the workings of relationships. I've been in a great relationship for 20 years but still feel like I'm learning from the failed relationships that preceded the successful one. We all have to learn from our mistakes, not run from them. The author did a great job in pointing out if we try to run from the negative memories, we just go around in circles. It is a pretty good analogy for not using drugs to run from uncomfortable memories. It would be interesting to know if that was in the mind of the author. This is the first time I've enjoyed a movie with Jim C. starring in it. He really is a good dramatic actor. He was smooth and in control. Kate W. was wonderful as always. Elijah W. took some chances with his role. I respect him more for that. This is definitely a movie that will be remembered.\n",

      "The way you wear your hat -- The way you sip your tea -- The memory of all that -- No, no they can't take that away from me...Actually, they can. Did you ever hear that classic Gershwin tune and wonder just who \"they\" are, and why They'd want to take those romantic memories away? Is this just a lover's awkwardly turned phrase, a sign of paranoia - or is someone seriously in with the wrong crowd?Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind lays out just such a scenario, and doesn't let up finding ways to tickle you with it until you're exhausted. \"They\" are professionals from Lacuna Inc. working to erase Joel Barish's memories of his ex, Clementine (Kate Winslet). Joel (Jim Carrey) hasn't given the procedure enough thought, and now each recall of a treasured moment with her is helping Them with their mind map and brain eraser.The way your smile just beams -- The way you sing off key -- The way you haunt my dreams -- No, no they can't take that away...This may be the most wonderfully, boldly imaginative movie I've ever seen. It keeps mostly to Joel's point of view, pushing movie and story form where they've never quite gone before. Devices like flashbacks serve their usual purposes as well as showing the effects of being drugged, trying to remember, to forget, or even to think something you've never thought before. There are chases and races inside Joel's brain, and places to hide there. The filmmakers take dozens of storytelling and special effects risks that pay off delightfully. Discovering them is half the fun, so I won't say more about the movie. My date and I laughed, cried, and sat back slack jawed the entire time - often all at once. (I mean my wife - how'd I forget?!)The way you hold your knife -- The way we danced till three -- The way you change my life -- No, no ...!Jim Carrey gives a subdued performance that won't annoy even his most ardent critics. Kate Winslet is fantastic - early in the film, she gives him a long, skeptical look, while holding her body at such a silly angle for so long that you finally have to laugh. And somehow you immediately understand what it's like to love this woman.This great film deserves all the acclaim director-writer Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman's utterly original script have received, and much more.\n",

      "We are not worthy Charlie Kaufman! This is what good creative film writing is all about folks. Kaufman is a genius. This film finally shows his merits and that he can carry a movie to commercial success without compromising too much on artistic merit.I wanted to review this film because I just bought it on DVD and saw it again. It's amazing how many things I missed in the movie the first time I viewed it on the big screen. This is one of those films you can see again and again and still get something new and refreshing from it.I also have to credit the French director who collaborated with Kaufman. His name is Michel Gondry. If it were not for his artistic vision and surreal cinematography expertise, this film would not translate well to a mass audience. It really shows you how important it is for creative minds in Hollywood to work as a team.Now for the acting. A drum roll please. Kate Winslet, I love you! Your portrayal of Clementine deserved an Oscar. It was so raw and energized. It was spontaneous and that is what attracted Joel to your character. They complimented each other so well. Seeing Jim Carrey as this introspective, reticent character was haunting and that is why it was so real.I do not want to give away any of the plot because I believe everyone should see this film. We have all been jilted by a lover once in our lives and that is why the romance between Joel and Clementine rings true to the heart universally.There is a seen that takes place between Joel and Clementine at a beach front house that is so moving it almost brought me to tears.I hope everyone has an opportunity to view this movie and enjoy it for the pain and pleasure you will feel when you experience it.\n",

      "I mostly enjoyed the movie, but not for the reasons most others seem to have enjoyed it. I keep reading words like \"soulful\", \"touching\",\"romantic\" and \"makes u think about ur own loved ones\". I just didn't get that feeling. I never felt emotionally attached to Joel-Clementine's relationship. They really didn't strike me as anything that special, but that did not ruin the movie for me. The unique concept in which the story is told is worthy of ur time itself - and really the biggest reason Y i liked it. The acting by both Winslet and Carrey is superb. Technically, its brilliant as well. I would've preferred a movie more emotionally engaging.....considering it's still about two people in love.....but we never really get to know the characters that well. The screenplay(some portions of Joel's memory) could also have been better in the 2nd half. It did leave me looking at the watch quite a few times.....and that's never a good sign. Overall, good, but not THAT good.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind asks the question: if you could lead a life without loss and unhappiness, would you really want to? It can be described as part sci-fi, part black comedy, and part romance. The characters are \"quirky,\" and I would be happy just to see a movie between the bickering gen X couple played by Mr. Show's David Cross and Happiness' Jane Adams. The cast is impressive, and there also is nice plot twist in the end.On the negative side (or the positive side for some), the story seems to be created by writers under the influence of recreational drugs. It may be too surreal for some viewers. At first, the frame of the story may seem impossible to follow, but be patient, and it is quite easy to understand. All the questions are answered by the end of the movie. If you can stay with the movie, you will find it entertaining and meaningful.\n",
      "1265\n",
      "Eternal sunshine is a brilliantly original film. It's diversity sets it aside from other films about love. Kate Winslet's performance is fantastic and actually diverts your attention from her surprisingly bad acting in Titanic. Jim Carey's performance shocked me incredibly, as his stereotypical comedy roles gives the impression that comedy roles is all he can do. This is without a dought Kirsten Dunst's best film to date, however she and the other young actors let the were the only thing that slightly let the film down. The story was funny, but also very compelling. It is definitely a film to keep you happy, if you like the humour present. The comedy is extremely funny. Granted, the jokes are an acquired taste, like the film itself, but if you like original, brilliently directed films, you'll love this.\n",
      "1266\n",
      "What is not to like about this movie ? It is not a movie to watch casually, it pays to watch it carefully and keep up. The effort is worth it though. Kate Winslet shines in a type of role that would be perfect for Jim Carrey but instead, he plays the more down to earth role that Kate so often inhabits. They are both superb in their engaging relationship. Charlie Kaufman has written his best screenplay so far, Adaptation was superb but this was plain amazing. He is such a great writer. Michael Gondry managed to direct this movie with some of the most original scenes, with editing to match in a way that remains confusing but makes sense (honestly!) and is deeply moving if you have ever been in love. I think the movie is just as good, if not better on the second viewing. It is encouraging that movies of this calibre that are so original and fresh are still being made.\n",
      "1267\n",
      "What kind of classic is this movie? Well, it's a romantic comedy. That's about all there is to say: It's a post-modern romantic comedy, a romantic comedy concerned with the idea of self hood in our world, but in the end the movie is about two quirky characters looking for love.When people say that a movie has value because it fore goes explosions and violence for... well... nothing, I think they're missing the point. You can make an intelligent, insightful movie while spraying blood at the audience, and you can make a dreadful, moronic piece of garbage without having one interesting thing happen. In the wake of the indie-film revolution, movies that follow the latter convention - yes, it's become a convention - haven't overtaken big-budget bombast per se, but they are a nice safe way for mediocre movie stars to gain indie credit.Then there's a movie like this. All those people who consider absence of spectacular destruction requisite for a good movie are assuming the existence of movies like this. Nothing happens in \"Eternal Sunshine\" - think about it: The main character is asleep most of the time; all the action is memory, and a lot of it isn't even accurate memory. What emerges is - in my opinion - the most genuinely moving portrait of the human soul that's ever been committed to film. People, like Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in the movie, are naive and foolish and like to think that the best world is one in which there is no pain or grief, so when Charlie Kaufman and co. introduce the terrific sci-fi trope of a memory-erasing machine they jump at the opportunity to lose those nagging, unpleasant moments.But you can't remove something from a person without destroying a part of who that person is, and that is exactly the course the movie tracks. The treatment destroys part of Jim Carrey's character. There's an old clich√©, \"If you chase out your devils, your angels will leave\"; when Jim Carrey watches his fights with Kate Winslet vanish, he's chasing out the devils. But when, in the film's absolute best scene, he kneels and begs his mind to let him keep one happy memory, he's watching his angels leave.As for the rest, the acting is wonderfully naturalistic, both by the lead and supporting characters (I hold it very much to Elijah Wood's credit that he can leave his Frodo persona in last year), the cinematography - especially in the opening scenes - is brilliant and calming, and the film's portrayals of the inside of the human mind are smart and interesting.Yes, it is a romantic comedy, and yes, it borders territory that could be insufferably pretentious. But \"Eternal Sunshine\" is a movie with a real soul.\n",

      "I loved this movie so much. At first, it seemed boring and confusing, but i decided to give it another 30 minutes. I'm so glad i did. The movie showcases two social outcasts. One is Joel(Carrey) who is reclusive, safe, and somewhat alienating. The other is Clementine(Winslet) who is impulsive, too outgoing, and borderline alcoholic. Both, in a series of coincidences during one day, meet and fall in love over time. When Joel fights with Clementine, she goes to a place to erase him from her memory. He hears of this and does the same thing. The movie travels through his thoughts and memories of their lost relationship and show that their relationship is a similar dynamic to most. Both actors did a great job of portraying these characters. Winslet showed a sort of impulsiveness and sadness in Clementine that help the audience better understand her actions. Each portrayal makes you feel attached to them. You can't miss a beat in this movie, but won't regret keeping up with it. This movie is sad, sweet, beautiful, unforgettable and surprisingly the most honestly romantic movie of the year that will stay close to your heart and mind.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.With a name like that, you should already know what you're getting yourself into.I finally saw this film last night, kinda grumpy, kinda tired. With my eyes still half open It amazed me to see everything happen at once. It reminded me of pulp fiction a way. For maybe the fact they both begin at the ending which definitely gets you pumped for a rockin' movie. The movie actually scared me. I mean If I was in their situation. A beautiful relationship gone sour, which in fact has happened. I don't exactly think i'd go to the extreme to erase them out of my mind. It's a little bazaar but I guess I could see why someone would want to do that. Memories are a huge part of our background. Even if some of them you don't want to think of on a regular basis, they make you who are. So, yeah that part of the movie really got me thinking.I don't know what to think of the ending, I didn't really enjoy that kristin dunst's character had told everyone what has actually happened to them. I understand why she did it, don't get me wrong. It's just the fact that, it's very unlikely. It seemed to be getting somewhat out of plot. but maybe that's just me.What I am actually trying to state, is that this movie can be, and most likely will be a movie that most can shake their heads and say \"yeah I know how she/he feels\". It's one of thoseeeeee films. hah Which no one can deny. So over all, Cheers to love, memories you'd like to forget, and the ones that are unforgettable.\n",

The movie itself is confusing to a lot of first time watchers so you have to have a deep concentration or you will not connect with the movie on as nearly a personal basis as myself and many other people have through watching it. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both give amazing performances, (Winslet is Oscar-nominated for this and Carrey SHOULD be as well), you truly feel for them as they experience what all couples shouldn't.

      "This movie is a wonderful example of how love triumphs over hate, and how no matter what you do, you can never escape the bliss and happiness of wonderful moments of love. The film starts out with Joel(Jim Carrey) rising out of bed. Upon leaving his apartment building he sees that his car is crashed and that he doesn't know how it happened. When he arrives at the train station he gets on a train. In the train-car he meets an eccentric woman named Clementine(Kate Winslet). The film focuses on their relationship for a little while longer. One day Joel goes to Clementine's work to see her and she acts as if she doesn't even know him. After nights of crying and trying to understand why Clementine would just completely ignore him, Joel goes to some of Clementine's friends' house. They show him a card that signifies that Clementine had her memories of Joel completely erased from her mind. Joel decides to do the same, and erase Clementine from his memory as well. During the procedure, Joel begins to regret the operation because wonderful thoughts of love and bliss between Joel and Clementine begin to be erased as well. What happens next is ...\n",

      "I admit that I'm a great fan of romantic comedies and I like most of them quite much, but this story simply moved me. Throughout the movie I've been gripped by it, anxious to see how it would end. If you like a bit twisted stories with lots of love, and if you're bored with romantic movies that follow the same pattern you should try this out. However, some women didn't like to movie as it was too twisted, too much original, so perhaps it isn't the best movie for a romantic date. Personally, I find the acting magnificent that is very real. Jim Carrey really did a great job there. To sum up, the story line is compelling and original, the acting great, and the movie curiously warm.\n",

Good plot, good acting, good music, etc... The idea of the film is that this guy wants to erase the memories that he has of his girlfriend. The way the movie was filmed is confusing but that isn't a bad thing at all. The director takes you through the memories in such a manner that baffles you. The way the main character's memories start to melt into one another and how he has a conversation with himself is so original. And for all of those people that say Jim Carrey can't act, this movie will prove you wrong and then some. This movie is one of my newly found favorite movies of all time. It is a must see.\n",

What if you could not remember anyone you went out with?The question is asked by Joel 'Can this cause brain damage?' the answer is 'It is technically Brain Damage' but I think the sociological damage is more severe that any damage from the treatment.Anyway this is a must but make sure you in the mood to sit and take in the movie.\n",

He met that girl in the beginning, spent a month or so with her, got operated... But it seems like he got back in time in that very day and everything began from the start. That's the only thing that made me confused. Though it's a great movie and everyone should see it. I watched it in the movies, now gonna buy a DVD to watch it at home cause it worth that.

I knew this was supposed to be a very good movie, but from the trailers and the limited number of reviews I'd read, I really wasn't sure what the movie was exactly about. But the trip through Jim Carrey's (Joel) mind while he has his memories erased is filled with some of the most inventive and enjoyable sequences of any new movies I've seen in a long time. Sometimes sad, sometimes happy, but always inciting in you some sort of emotion, these surreal sequences are fun to watch but also insightful and thought-provoking.This movie really isn't really a comedy in the sense that most people think, but has some very sweet elements mixed in with the sad and thoughtful scenes that make you sympathize with the characters...I had given this an 8/10, but I really feel that it is around 8.5/10, so I've bumped my rating up to 9, because this movie really does deserve its place on the top 250...and though this is no great character study such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Patton, and others like those, this really is a thoroughly enjoyable story with great insightful characters that one can really sympathize with and identify with.\n",

Maybe it was the fact I had gone through a set of personal experiences in which I saw parallels to the movie, but more realistically it was the fact that I took in every moment of the cinematography. Not only is this a psychological adventure for the viewer it's a movie classic in the making. I've seen a lot of negative IMDb comments on this movie and plenty of praise too. Some will either get it... or they won't. Would any of us erase a person from their life if they had to give up every good time as well as every bad ?. It is thought provoking... I really like that too. There has also been criticism of the dialogue as being weak... I don't think that is true either. When I've discussed some of the stupid things I've said, well it seems real enough to me. I'm writing this comment as the Award season of 2005 is upon us, if this movie does not get recognized for the finely crafted masterpiece it is I will finally know that film making has become a dark art. A craft that is no longer understood by those in power. See this movie again... it's well worth a second viewing. I put money on this becoming a movie that is as powerful in 30 years as it is today, it's one for the movie collection. Well done Focus Films and thank you to all the cast and crew for putting this together so brilliantly. WOW !!!\n",

      "The latest film from the mind of Charlie Kaufman is filled with experimental techniques and delivers a universal message about first love. Now I loved Being John Malkovich because it was so different and endlessly interesting, yet I hated Adaptation because it practically put me in a coma. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the title taken from an Alexander Pope line and recited by a stoned Kirsten Dunst in the film. Michel Gondry has directed such a surreal and dreamlike journey through the mind and memories. I'm not even going to bother summarizing the plot because it is quite complicated and you just have to see it for yourself. What I will say is that Jim Carrey has once again amazed us with his acting abilities and has shown us a quieter, lonelier side to him. Kate Winslet was the perfect actress for this part, the two of them have created one of the most realistic relationships I've seen on film in a long time. The film demonstrates how as much as we want to forget a troubled relationship, the good memories, no matter how few and far between, are what really shines above the rest. In the end the film poses the question, \"What if we were given the chance to start all over again with our first love, knowing how it ended and why it ended, would we do it?\" And instead of leaving the answer up to us, Kaufman brilliantly comes right out and says, \"Yes we would!\" He says we would because a chance to relive all those good memories is worth it. This film hit pretty close to home with me because I experienced a first love somewhat similar to theirs and I'm sure that I am not alone on that. It's a wonderful film that reminds us just how special our first love really is.\n",

      "it really would be nice if we could expunge selective memories. but then we wouldn't learn from our mistakes.Jim Carrey has come a LOOOONG way since those awful 'pay yer dues' days prancing around in a diaper on the lowest-common-denominator 'living colour' with the wayans brothers. whose latest fare is the abominable 'white chicks'. Jim Carrey absolutely shines in this film. and Kate Winslet too.Jim Carrey's varied roles in my opinion, are his attempt to branch out, experiment, to discover his strong points. well, he has succeeded. he is now firmly in the category of serious actor. but, being Canadian, he doesn't take himself too seriously. you don't hear a lot about Jim Carrey making impossible diva-like demands on his handlers etc. He's still young too, so we have a lot to look forward too from this fine actor.\n",

      "The movie is well done and unusual. Let me start off by saying I am not a big fan of the Hollywood type romantic films- you know the ones written according to the old formula ( he meets her, she does not like him they fall in love and marry) Even though this is not one of those People still call it a chick flick, This is a very superfluous view of the movie- even though the plot is based around a couples emotional turmoils and exploration of their feelings for each other, and that can be seen as banal. But hey taking the view that everything there is to write has already been written and everything there is to say has already been said, similarly almost everything there is to be put on screen - you get the picture. The fascinating thing about this movie is how it makes us forget the banal and concentrate on the process of the story- even though the plot can be hard to follow, because it is so well done you do not get lost, there is a very distinct thread of coherence pulling it all together. Anyway, I watched it with my husband, who is very hard to please, and he seemed to have like it as well his words were \"hmm not bad,\" even so, I enjoyed it thoroughly and highly recommend it.\n",

I know there's no accounting for taste, and mine is probably as bad as anyone else's, but there is so much that is wonderful in this movie--so much that stays with you after you leave the theater--that it deserves a better fate than what it may become--a cult classic.And yet, it's kind of fun, isn't it, to like something that the masses thumbed their noses at? To be part of a little coterie that does appreciate imaginative writing, inspired directing, amazing cinematography, and remarkable acting? Of course I'm not denying the possibility that our little coterie is way off base, but I don't care.\n",

This film takes your mind on a journey, to places you never even THOUGHT about thinking about. Jim Carey and Kate Winslett are superb, as are the writing and plot. Do not see this film expecting many dazzling CGI effects. This film intrigues and astounds on sheer acting and plot alone. This intelligent, science-fiction movie will require your full attention the whole length of the film, or you are liable to become lost. Before basing your opinion on this movie, I would recommend seeing it twice, as you may not fully comprehend the plot the first time around.

      "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a clever, imaginative and bizarre movie. Basically the story is Josh(Jim Carey) wakes up like any other day. Instead of going to work Josh jumps on a train where he meets Clementine(Kate Winslett). At first Josh is quiet and shy and cannot start a conversation. Clementine makes the first move and from there on the relationship blossoms and they fall in love. After they knew each other for a while Clementine is behaving strangely towards Josh. She cannot remember who he is, because her memory of Josh has been erased. When Josh knows what she has done he is very cross and angry. So Josh decides to go to the same doctor and have her memory erased from his brain. The next part of the movie is very strange and weird. I'ts hard to figure out what is happening.It grabs you right away and sends you on an amazing journey through the memories of Josh. It has so many twists and turns especially when Clementine is talking to Josh and suddenly vanishes. This happens several times. The reason is Josh is slowly erasing Clementine from his brain and these memories actually happened in reality but now gone forever. Josh wants to keep the memories when they were in love and remember the good times they shared together, but he cannot because all around him. The scenery is disappearing and gone forever in his mind. When Josh has finally erased Clementine. He finds her and tries to begin their relationship again. At first she does not come to terms straight away. Josh persuades her that we had good times together and we can start a fresh. Clementine and Josh make up and can start their lives together in the real world. I would recommend you watch this movie, it is uplifting, unique and different from most films you would enjoy.I would recommend 'Mulholland Drive' & 'Donnie Darko' both these films are similar to 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'.\n",

It is difficult to follow in the beginning, but once it all comes together it is an amazing film. Jim Carrey, and Kate Winslet do a marvelous job putting you in a different emotional place than any other movie can. It shows you a different perspective when you look at a relationship. It shows that bad memories are always wanted to be forgotten, but if you realize all of the good times, then you do not want to lose it all. This is one of my all time favorite movies, and is very worthy of seeing!!\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine marks the second collaboration between the writer and director that I am aware of, the first being Human Nature. While Nature was an excellent film-- well-cast, well-written, and well-shot-- Eternal Sunshine is a more intricate work. The storyline is quite a good deal more involved and may be Kaufman's most emotional work yet (Adaptation being the possible exception). Gondry, directing with what can only be assumed to have been a much larger budget, skillfully manipulated every visual, sonic, and temporal aspect of the film, moving us through it in a style which is all his own. This film reflects more the energy and pace of Gondry's music videos than that of Human Nature, which is by no means a fault. The opposite is true: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is easily the most recognizable film of the year it was released, thanks to the storytelling ability of Charlie Kaufman and the virtuosic powers of presentation possessed by Michel Gondry.\n",

That is - not exactly the thought that this reminded me of \"The Matrix\", but a very similar sense of sensory overload, having watched a cutting edge piece of work, and at the same time having been touched by a great story.Even though I've seen several Charlie Kaufman movies and liked them all, I never expected this to actually be able to take the concept of a \"love movie\" and mix it with the Kaufman-style of realism combined with his quirky, signature experimentalism.Well what more can I say.. it's a good one, highly recommended. I'll definitively watch it again. C. Kaufman is like the big director of our time, enjoy it as long as it lasts..\n",

      "Probably the best movie of 2004. Gondry shows how a director of music videos can easily beat the big guys. Jim Carrey shows how great he really is (he also did that in Man on the Moon). Beck turns a disco-classic into a sentimental ballad. And it's one of the greatest film-titles ever. Why is this movie not nominated for best picture for the Oscars??????Haven't seen the nominated movies yet, but I'll vote for Scorsese. Only because he's one of the best, but it isn't really objective 'cause I didn't see The Aviator.Okay, let's wait and find out!!!\n",

      "it never gets to real emotions due to, in my opinion, bad casting choices.Jim Carrey seems to know too much about making movies and this really prevents him to become the character. He can play the shy guy, he can play the little infant. However he's still not playing the man in love. He looks anxious but yet not passionate, not moved deep inside. He just knows how to look good and that's it. To the Academy members, please don't nominate Mr Carrey. He's got a long way to go before he reaches a convincing drama role.Kauffman's screenplay is amazing. At times it reaches the same level of complexity and absurdity than Woody Allen's stories. And this should be taken as a compliment. I wish him lots of his books produced.Great story, if only Lacuna Inc exists...\n",

      "i had been procrastinating to see this movie for a long time and I finally got around to renting it on DVD about a month ago. I had heard about an unusual plot twist so I started watching the movie with the mind of a detective, but then I just decided to let the movie take me along for the ride. I was absolutely amazed at the intricacy of the story and how complex it is. Everyone in this film delivers a knockout performance. Jim Carrey is incredible, not only for his amazing acting, but his ability to show that he can do something else besides being a complete buffoon. Kate Winslet really nailed her part also, and really convinced me that she was truly her character, Clementine. In addition, the side plot involving Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst was also a twist i didn't see coming. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood were also really good. Even though i knew the ending would have a twist, I totally did not expect that it would happen in the way it did, and essentially, the whole movie is a flashback. The film captures the complexity of the human mind, and plays off of the psychological effects of interpersonal relationships. It is a true cinematic gem that should be revered by generations. If you have not seen this movie, you should do so now.\n",

And I must say that this is one of the best movies ever made. It's really beautiful, the actors are great, they play real good, and the story is just incredible. I was a little bit confused at the beginning of the movie, but that didn't take long. The scene in the house, were Joel and Clementine first met, was one of the best scenes in the story. when they both realize they won't remember each other and Joel just says: enjoy it. This movie is an example of one with a nice deep vision and I strongly recommend to everybody to go and see this movie. you won't regret it !\n",

It's an emotional love story with an occasional comedic twist. It's a movie that makes you think, but in the end doesn't make you over-think or confuse you with the plot. It's definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to fully figure out what is going on, but the movie is worth seeing more than once. It's the type of movie to watch with a girlfriend or boyfriend because of the romance that is exuded by Carey and Winslett. I definitely put this movie in the top 10 of movies I've ever seen. Absolutely brilliant.\n",

      "This is my first review but I spend a lot of time on IMDb and I was horrified to see that Eternal Sunshine was the leading candidate for top movie of 2004. I enjoyed this movie on many levels, especially the great performances by the two leads. Carrey was (for once) subdued yet still strangely magnetic and Winslet was radiant, nearly sublime. Kauffman's script was quirky, involving, thought-provoking, fun--all the things we've come to expect from him. However, the entire Lacuna crew was laughable. Drinking, smoking pot while using a colander to perform intricate brain surgery? Dancing around on the bed in their underwear like a couple of 15-year-olds? I wouldn't trust these people to watch my fish never mind meddle with my noodle. Each scene was so obnoxious and unnecessarily over the top, I thought a Batman & Robin-era Joel Schumacher had slipped behind the camera. Like I said, a good move but faulted.\n",

      "This movie was like a blend of science fiction and love, which are my two favorite subjects.. Jim Carrey brought something very new for him to the table, showing his true versatility. Carrey broke away from his traditional silly, and outgoing nature in films, to play a shy and quiet guy named \"Joel\", Elijah Woods also was a big part of this film.. a stunning performance by Kate Winslet as \"Clementine\" only added to the master piece of Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind... The name alone drew me in, and after i saw that Jim Carrey was in it, I had to give it a peep.. Trust Me, movies don't get that much better, this is very entertaining...Loved it, and highly recommend it.. 9/10\n",

      "I was pleasantly surprised at the depth and poignancy of this movie. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are fantastic! Their acting brings much more to the movie than just dialogue. Although they wanted their memories erased at first, it was only because they loved each other so much. This love causes them to constantly bicker and disagree, but they didn't realize how lucky they were to have each other until they almost lost each other forever. Really there are very few people in life worth erasing forever. I actually can think of 2 people I'd gladly erase from my life. The only reason I might not erase them is because I learned a lot from the experiences and I do not want to make those same mistakes again. Joel and Clementine have something so special that when they meet a second time as strangers, they still find a connection! It does seem that they are soul mates. They realize that they want the same things in life, but not necessarily in the same order. They must agree to disagree and not take every discussion as a personal attack. This movie makes you think so much about your own love life and friends that it's frightening! This is one of the few movies that you will continue to think about long after you've seen it.Winslet and Carrey definitely deserved their Golden Globe nominations. This movie is a must see!\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet is a story of lessons learned. Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) have a very unique yet dysfunctional relationship that ends with Clementine deciding to completely erase Joel from her memory. When Joel learns what she has done, he in turn decides to erase Clementine. In the middle of the procedure, Joel revisits memories of happiness, memories of love. Although he was hurt by Clementine, he can not bear thought of losing those special memories, and does everything he can to hold on to the little he has left.Many viewers confused this movie with an average boy/girl love story, a chick flick with that \"feel-good\" ending, but that is not what this movie is about. This story teaches us to learn from our mistakes, and that wisdom is derived from good AND bad experiences. A broken heart can make someone stronger, pain teaches us mercy, suffering teaches compassion. People who can accept their scars, are the wisest of us all. Joel and Clementine are perfect examples of the fool that forgets what life has taught him and is forced to re-live his most careless mistakes over and over again.Everyone who commented on this movie as being anything less than fantastic had no right to go see it in the first place. It would be nice if you let the intelligent people enjoy this without having to endure your idiotic ramblings about \"oooh i don't understand..\" Stick to Scooby Doo, you'll be much happier.I highly recommend this movie.Lindsay\n",

      "This was billed as a comedy, and I expected it to be rather funnier than it was. It had its moments, but humour was not its focus. The plot line is simple enough - you have memories you don't like, so you get them erased. I couldn't help wondering how practical that would be. The film seemed largely to assume that you could remain blissfully unaware afterward that you had some missing memories, yet even events in the film made it clear that this could never happen.The team that performs the procedure are rather unprofessional. I suppose that was meant to be funny, and to a limited extent formed part of the plot. I just found it appalling.In the end, I found the film disturbing. If you can get memories erased, and not know that you've done it, then even if you've never had it done, you wouldn't know that for sure. Memories are part of what makes you you. The process described in the film seemed a bit like committing suicide in increments.But I'm glad I saw it.Sylvia.\n",

      "This movie is captivating. Kudos to everyone involved, especially Charlie Kaufman, Michael Gondry, Jim Carey and Kate Winslet. Carey and Winslet break the mold and transform themselves into two characters completely unlike anything they've played before. They both give the best performances of their lives. The writing is amazing, full of emotional depth, subtleties, humor and darkness. It takes you through an emotional and visual train ride (or train wreck) of a dysfunctional relationship bringing the audience to a deeper understanding of the value of experiences, both good and bad, and a person's subconscious. It is my absolute favorite, and gets better every time.\n",

      "I've seen the movie a number of times and I have noticed a couple of things that leads me to a rather obscure interpretation (which is not that strange since it is an obscure movie). It seems to me that the movie is, at least in part, about an abortion. Now before i begin, i want to say that I personally am pro choice but i see an alternative message in this movie. 1. The first thing that points me towards this interpretation is that the catalyst that causes Kate Winslet to get the procedure is a fight about having a baby. She says that she wants a baby and he says that they're not ready. this fight causes her to go out and get drunk and then get the procedure2. In essence, the memory of their relationship is the only offspring of their relationship. In destroying the memories, she destroys that offspring3. In the sidestory with Kirstin Dunst, we are presented with a story of a married older man having an affair with a beautiful young woman, this is a classic situation in which the woman would have an abortion. Also, when she finally listens to her tape, we hear him saying \"we both agreed that it would be for the best\", which is the language often used with an abortion. I agree that this is not damning evidence, however it is difficult to ignore. The overall moral of the movie is of course that there is no eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. It shows that It is not right to erase the mistakes of the past for want of happiness because it does not ultimately bring happiness or eternal sunshine but instead emptiness. Again I personally do not agree with this message as it relates to abortion but it is hard to ignore that this relation exists in the movie itself.\n",

      "I agree with what John Ulmer wrote in his review on this website. I cannot say much more. This was a fantastic experience that most people would miss out on, as they are unwilling to try something new. This is certainly new and exciting and unusual.The only thing I did not like was the swearing. If the swearing were cut out then it would be much better. I only rate it a 9 because of that, otherwise it would be a 10.And, when I saw the beginning, not much made sense, until I watched through to the end and it all made sense. So if you start watching this and are thinking it does not make sense, then watch through to the end, and maybe see it again. I plan to watch this again.\n",

      "I am eternally grateful that I am in the conscientious state of mind to review the phenomenon of an avant-guarde film that is \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". Not even the memory erasers of Lacuna can wipe my retrospection of this grand pelicula. Wait a second! What is happening? the Lacuna memory-wipers have snatched me! There has been a misunderstanding! I said i did not want this procedure done to me, Lacuna! Do not do this! What I meant is that people who are trepidated by \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" are being babies and they belong in \"la cuna\"! Help meeeeee! Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #1: This innovative flick stars Jim Carrey as (man, what was his name in the movie? I think it had something to do with me!) Oh yes! His name is Joel! Man, that is my name! Joel is timid & sequestered (not me!), he drives a gray Toyota (me!), and wants to erase the memory of his last romantic relationship from his mind (always me! except the sex scenes! might need those for future self-help exercises!) Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #2: That Titanic actress with those titillating tits co-stars as Clementine. Oh my darling, Clementime! What is her name? I can't \"win\" since I am \"let\"ting the Lacuna technicians erase my memory. That is it! \"Win\" \"Let\"! Kate Winslet!!!!!!!! Yes! Clementine is the impulsive eccentric who first opts for the Lacuna procedure in order to erase her memory of her romance with Joel (which most of the girls I have gone out with have also opted to do). Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #3: Living screen writing genius Charlie Chaplin has written another clever script that clearly is unforgettable! Wait! His name is not Charlie Chaplin! It's Charlie something! (I start to cough repeatedly). \"Man\", I must stop \"cough\"ing! That is it! \"Cough\" \"Man\" Kauffman!!!!!! His name is Charlie Kaufman! Yes!!!!! Eat your heart out Lacuna! End of Memory Erasing! OK, I had my fun! I think I should stop these memory erasing puns before all of you erase this review very soon! To sum it all up, Carrey and Winslet's performances were exceptional and will be embedded in your cerebral cortex for days! That is no case of brain damage! Not to far off are the remarkable supporting acting contributions of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and Elijah Wood. They all play the Lacuna technicians who are in no doubt Lacuna Lunatics. Jon Brion's musical film score scores high points as the best film score of the year! Last but not least, we cannot forget the directorial brainyman of \"Eternal Sunshine\". That would be French Director Michel Gondry! He had a \"Gondre\" task to achieve in directing a Kauffman script and he was able to do it masterfully! \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" take on: fervency, anamnesis, subsistence, loneliness, and exigency cleaned house with originality to make this film spotless in cinematic magnanimity. ***** Excellent\n",

      "ESOTSM is responsible for opening my eyes to some fundamental truths behind love and relationships. Namely, a relationship is more than the sum of its parts; love transcends the physical and that the definitions are entirely up to you and your beloved. This film seems to have serendipitously fallen together - a beautiful, accidental collision of an intense script, gorgeous cinematography, playful and creative design and editing, unique performances from some formerly typecast actors, and a wonderful score. This film gives back as much as it demands from the viewer, which few films do these days. Be prepared for some serious reflection. Thank god that surrealism has found a new and more relevant life in the hands of Michel Gondry. See this film alone and then see it with someone important to you... it might change your life.\n",

      "Without having any knowledge of what the film was about, I began to watch it. A man met a woman, strangely fast, they fell in love... Oh, no, is that all?Surprisingly, there was a totally different story behind that. Gradually, it was shown in front of me, so real that I was deeply into it. Love, hate, happy, sorrow, inspiring, depressed, every feeling were around me and the painful of losing was hard to be driven away. Love and ignore all his shortcomings, get boring, hate and ignore all his merit. People are doing this all the time and many just aren't aware of it. If only they can drill deep inside their mind, they will find that hate can also become a beautiful memory.This is life. What shall we do? Face it and enjoy it.\n",

Jim Carrey has his best performance to date, it's a very understated(for him), nuanced role. And Kate Winslet is the epitome of an actress whenever she's on screen. The other actors in the movie, Elijah Wood, Tom Sozemore, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst all give great performances as well. Of all the Charlie Kaufman movies this is his finest screen writing work.

I can't come up with ANY movie that comes even near this story, it's really one of a kind. It's also amazing to see Jim Carrey playing such a role... All my favorite movies have gone down one spot just so this one could be at the top...After the movie was over, I just watched the credits go by as I was really stunned by the movie...my eyes were open but I wasn't looking.This movie is ... amazing\n",

Certainly a film worth watching although neither lead character is very likable and Annie Hall seemed a whole lot more like real life. Didn't get too many laughs out of this one either, must mean Jim Carrey did some good acting.

It appears to me that Stan the technician deliberately left Mary alone with Doctor Howard in Joel's apartment. I cannot understand why Stan left the apartment. Did Mary ask Stan to leave so that she could be alone with Dr Howard? Were Stan and Dr Howard sharing Mary? I am confused as to why Stan left the apartment, knowing that Mary and Dr Howard had had a previous relationship, albeit knowing that Mary had had her memory erased of the event. Can anyone help me clarify this? Thank you for your assistance.\n",

      "The technical process (erasing all or parts of human memory) does not appeal to me. Trying to create a plot, drama, conflict using this is quite risky. Most of human situations happens in a linear time line. Any warps (back & forth, erasure movements in the story) will risk enjoyment and appreciation of this natural and standard processing of reflection. Frankly, achieving artistry on a technical platform has always been unattractive to me, let alone a memory one. A deus ex machina will be the maximum technique I can tolerate.The portrayal of romance by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett are very good. By the time viewers like me 'catch on,' there is only so little time left for the 'emotional gravity' that has been sorted to take effect. Maybe, when tweaking memory is perfected like the other techniques of cinematic belief suspension, the time budget of the movie can accommodate this and its consequent appreciation. Just one average moviegoer's opinion.\n",

This was the most amazing movie i've ever seen, it has comedy, sweetness, drama, good music (Beck's song is wonderful) and love. I was impressed, and I watched it 3 times in movies because it's the best movie in all the history. I hope it'll win 6 or 8 Oscars, including best principal actor (Carrey), best principal actress (Winslet), best director (Gondry), best original script (Kaufman) and best special effects. I loved it cause it takes us to an imaginary and wonderful world inside Kaufman's head. Did you see 'Being john Malkovich'? No? You have to see it. It's amazing too.

His role is played with such stark emotion that it's difficult to fathom how he managed to invoke the frame of mind I imagine must have been required.Kate Winslet is also apparent as something I could never her being. Her part is overflowing with feeling and heart, while at the same time exuding a gritty realism that makes her interplay with Jim's character that much more intense.The storyline is related with perfect structure and the gradual slope approaches the ending with meaningful delivery.The film is technically perfect and cannot be faulted in any other way....\n",

      "They released this movie in this country a few months after its US release which meant that I had more than enough time to hear all the rave reviews and praises for this film by both film critics and ordinary moviegoers. So when the film finally made its debut locally I made it a point to see it right away.First and foremost let's get to the screenplay of the film. The whole narrative of the movie was unique and refreshing. Even though initially the idea didn't really click with me, however over the course of the movie I began to love the unique nature of the story. I thought the basic flow of the movie can sometimes get confusing as you try to figure out which part comes first and what follows ala 21 Grams or Memento. Nonetheless it was effective in getting the story across to us the viewers.Even though I was not that impressed with Jim Carrey's previous \"dramatic\" roles in the Truman Show and The Majestic, I thought this effort was good enough. Maybe even the best performance among the three. I thought he really did a good job in juggling emotions of love with bitterness and sorrow. Not really a performance that will net Carrey a small gold statue come March but nonetheless still a good job. If Carrey's performance was good, I thought Kate Winslett's performance was also. She was very effective as Clementine so much that you can really feel some of the emotions that Joel Barrish might have felt. This was supported by great performances by the supporting cast most notably by Tom Wilkinson who was more than what meets the eye.I feel this film could get a lot of accolades when the awards season starts up next year. How many awards it will take home will be determined once the other contenders come out. This will definitely compete strongly in screenplay and some acting honors.\n",

The music the cinematographer and all in definitive the best performance of carrey after Truman show and we can consider now that Kate winslet is an actress serious and she is able to do anything or any role, Tom wilkinson kristen Dunst and Elijah Wood are correctly too, and Michael Gondry worked so hard I'm sure and for that this is a great picture Thanks so much Charlie Kaufman you are one of the best original scripter of the moment\n",

So gifted in his visual humor, I was happy to see him just be a low-key gentle guy. And what a great movie - kind of like a kinder, gentler Memento in its boundary stretching view. I really enjoyed it and wished I had spent the money to see it on the big screen. I wish we had a classics theater that would show second chance films for those of us who don't run out to see big screen movies unless we KNOW it is a big screen movie like X men, Spiderman, or The Lord off the Rings Trilogy. I gave it a 10/10 for creativity.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of Sporless M√ùnd\" is one of the best movies i have ever watched, since the characters in it are normal,everyday people that you could see around, however the lifetime they are having is completely extraordinary. Normally, I pick up a movie to watch after a good search (Since i don't have enough time due to my work, i want the movie to worth it. ), but this time i picked \"Eternal Sunshine\" randomly and i think i will keep choosing randomly after this movie. The idea of forgetting some particular things, -actually erasing them -is something we all wish from time to time and this movie has hell of a job expressing this emotion of us. I advice anyone, who wishes having that deletion of memories, to spend some time with this movie, it is worthy.\n",

And Jim Carrey should stick to comedy, don't ruin your career over this douche, it's just not worth it. To sum up, story sucked, concept sucked, acting sucked, direction sucked, lighting sucked, the boom mic guy sucked, etc... Don't waste your time with this wannabe-film and pick up something more entertaining that wasn't written by Kaufman, you'll thank me later.

      "OK, I'm not going to bash this movie because it did have it's merits. It was just an interesting concept that didn't work for me. Character development was nil which makes us apathetic about their relationship which makes for a rotten love story. Not a funny movie although probably not meant to be. Whats left? An average drama I suppose. Let's face it, two hours of dream sequences had a lot of us bored & restless regardless of how clever the concept may have been. I really liked Winslets and Carreys performances. The rest of the cast was expendable. Overall a 7 out of 10. Coulda been a contender(on my list). I feel as if critics jumped on the bandwagon on this one for fear of being pass√© or out of touch. Maybe with all of the Hollywood garbage out there now a carnation such as this comes out smelling like a rose. Worth a watch, that's it. The ending reminded me of Jerry McGuire(good film , bad love story). Two people settling for mediocrity.\n",

That said, I did not recognize Jim Carrey in his role as Joel and I did not recognize his acting style in this particular movie. He was absolutely incredible - completely different. I was shocked! Kate Winslet, brilliant as always. I loved Kate in this role. Her accent was perfect - sounded exactly like a friend of mine who was raised in Brooklyn. I won't give a summary because I don't want to repeat everything that's already been said. I will say this: Eternal Sunshine reminded me what it's like to be totally heartbroken, which is why I cried at the end. The acting is so good that I felt everything the characters felt - the happiness, the amusement, the communication, the lack of communication, the anger, the betrayal, the jealousy, the hatred, the desperation...the absolute heartbreak. It must have been emotionally draining for Kate and Carrey while making this movie. I highly recommend this film. It's a tad slow in parts, it's a tad talky in parts, but I recommend it simply because the story is utterly fascinating, the acting is incredibly real and the script is damn fine. 9/10 (9 because Kirsten Dunst annoys me)\n",
      "1320\n",
      "For a high-concept setting, it's not a high-concept movie, and that's what works so well about Eternal Sunshine. I found the film engaging, immersive, and -- for a movie about memory erasure -- surprisingly real. I'd imagine that even people who find they don't enjoy \"weird\" movies might find a lot to relate to in Eternal Sunshine, as the movie provokes a viewer's memories of the exhilaration of meeting someone for the first time, and the pain they felt as the relationship disintigrated.The screenplay provides a completely solid basis for the performances, and casting Carrey and Winslet as the lead couple worked great. Who'd have thunk it? Jim Carrey plays an introvert, while Winslet plays a frumpy and moody girl on the edge... and it fits perfectly. I was somewhat less enthusiastic about Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood, but overall, they didn't get in the way too much.A fine movie, full of interesting visuals and compelling characters... definitely worth a look.\n",

Whereas his meandering storytelling allows for lots of visual experiments, it leaves a lot to be desired in congruency. Kaufman writes weak stories - but he is big on \"wonderment\" - which would make teaming up with Spielberg a big payday for him. This movie is pseudo- intellectual in that is obviously inspired by a random quote from an obscure 18th century British poet. I am not convinced that the writer is some authority on Alexander Pope. The films premise is stunted because the driving force behind it should be the 'memory erasing technology', which is never defined for the audience. In the 1981 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner, there is a defined concept of memory remnants that are artificially installed in human(oid) replicas. Having clearly defined a thriving world of cloning in a neo-futuristic setting the audience is comfortable with whatever grows from (that) backbone of reason. Being categorised as a COMEDY does not exempt 'SPOTLESS' from this crucible of relevance. Thus the film is a failure in this regard. Jim Carey is perfect as the protagonist/victim; Kate Winslet looks great suppressing her upper-British accent; Kirsten Dunst and the other supporting cast are seemingly contrived and annoying for the most part. Once again, Gondry prevails here having his way, flexing his visual muscle. A director's film for sure .\n",

      "Some of the other reviewers will drone on about the inherent struggle in modern man between the rational and the irrational. Some of the other reviewers will try to impress you with their understanding of this film as an indictment of our unthinking society married to the yearning to immerse oneself in those same undifferentiated drinking-pot-smoking- carefree ways. They see it they story of two people doing they best they can in play and love in our crazy inhuman world, a world with water everywhere but not a drop to drink.Some of the other reviewers will even tell you that this film is a work of modern art, citing the schizophrenic direction, the anxious performances by Carrey and Winslet, the brilliantly weird-incongruous sound work, or the Kaufman-trademark wordplay. I instead am stressing an overlooked aspect of this film:IT HAS KIRSTEN DUNST DANCING IN HER PANTIES BOOOOHH YEAAAAHHHHH GAME OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10.0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "A little vanilla sky, sweet November(was good though), and just a bunch of freaks. Not funny, fails at its attempts to be a love story which I guess I'm not a fan of any way. Wow! I guess I'm one of the few that is trashing this movie. Go head and watch and unless you watch so many movies that one so far off the beatin' path of good actually seams good to you, then you wont like it either. I feel that the writers have run out of ideas or had too much time on there hands for them to think this is something investors would pit there caassh on. Hodeho off we go to see another good one. I like most movies I see, 95% at least. This is different.W-o-time\n",

      "This is originality at it's finest. Aspiring writers are all jealous of Kaufman's brain. The heart of this movie is Carrey and he does a very credible, convincing job of playing his part. We all know Carrey as the over the top comic who can't calm down. He is the opposite of this in this movie. Winslet is as vivacious as ever but it is Carrey who truly shines here. This is yet another movie that uses its supporting characters to weave a tale. I will part with others in calling this the best movie I have seen this year (in my mind, that still goes to The Terminal) but I did enjoy it and felt that I was watching something highly original. I hope the Academy will honor Carrey with an Oscar nod for his work in this movie. In addition to a screen writing nomination for Kaufman. 8/10\n",

      "I don't have anything to add to the praise for this film, that other users haven't said already. This is an excellent movie, very original and well-done. However, would the doctor of Lacuna employ two irresponsible kids to carry out his bizarre procedure? Drinking beer, smoking pot, and having sex while a man's brain is tampered with? It's just absurd. I suppose one must \"suspend disbelief.\" Another thing: what was up with Joel not shaving? I understand being lazy about shaving, but would Clementine be attracted to this taciturn guy who doesn't shave or comb his hair, and always wears that dopey cap? I doubt it.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is the most recent film from Charlie Kaufman, the screenwriter who has become a phenomenon as the only writer in contemporary film (with the exception of writer/directors) whose name rattles off moviegoers' tongues...[As is the expectation of commenting on IMDb, I too will list some of the other Kaufman written flicks that I enjoyed.]...You see, he's the writer behind \"Adaptation\" and \"Being John Malkovich\". The latter film shares the most in common with \"Eternal Sunshine\", which is very much a two hour version of the chase scene through Malkovich's subconscious. The film stars Jim Carrey, who seems light years away from \"Ace Ventura\" in a particularly subdued performance, and Kate Winslet, who has given consistently strong performances since 1994's \"Heavenly Creatures\" and I feel is one of the finest actresses working today, as well as a small roster of wonderful talent (the overlooked Mark Ruffalo, as well as Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, and Tom Wilkinson).It's an intellectually engaging film, which I think really detracts from the whole romantic, emotional impact. I never fully felt like the relationship that the two leads erase seemed much more than tortured unrequited love and full of mind games, but maybe that was the point.It's a really fine film, and well worth a look, which is likely what you will hear from just about everyone.So why haven't you seen it yet?\n",

      "This is a very clever film, where you have to think hard, particularly for the first half. The acting (and effects) are excellent. Because of the complexity of the plot, it was only in the second half that I began to (understand) and felt increasingly involved with what was going on.Brilliant scenes on the beach, flashbacks, imagining childhood, running from erasing memories and at the doctor's. Another part of the film's brilliance was to make the science fiction of memory removal become totally believable. And the progression of the plot never lets up, with constant addition of new aspects right up to the end. In contrast with some films where reality and fantasy are intentionally confused (which I generally find annoying) this film gives sufficient clues to help the viewer to identify the scenes which are reality from others that are flashbacks or imagination.A lot of lessons on relationships - particularly the ultimate value of memories, even if they are painful.\n",

      "We found parallels to our own lives. The story line was unique. Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet did an incredible job. It was great seeing Jim Carrey do a role outside his comedic self. Uplifting and confirming that true love will prevail and find itself no matter where it hides. One of the two of us who saw this movie would erase each other if it would truly work but this movie illustrates that you cannot hide from your destiny. You cannot choose who you love and who is your soul mate. If only you could. Eternal Sunshine makes this point loud and clear. A great date movie. Should be nominated for an academy award for several categories including best original screenplay and best actor and actress.\n",

It's a funny movie, but at the same time, I felt almost like crying at certain times. It has a particular melancholy. It has some pretty weird scenes which I usually like in movies, but sometimes it's just too much, like you don't know where it's going, what's the point. This one avoid this path, that's why I think it's a complete success. The Jim Carrey's character and his relationship also reminds me of myself on certain points, I think that's why the movie touches me this much.Anyway, you definitively need to watch this.

      "How can anyone not love this film. Gondry and Kaufman are geniuses. This film undoubtedly has the greatest screenplay I've ever come across, and, what does it for me, the background effects are sumptuous. Very few films have ever gone into my top 10, but it is only the second to enter at No. 1. If you haven't seen it, watch it. If you've watched it, buy it and watch it again. You will pick up so much more the second time around, and it is apparently unfortunate that this film slipped through the cracks of cinema? This films is made for people who love films, not entertainment. Carrey proved that he is not a one trick pony, but a multi-furlong stallion. This multigenre film has enabled everyone to look at films and to see what can be done behind the hype. In short, then, a future legend in film. Winslet, however, captures the escence of her role so brilliantly, that combined with Carrey, the superb cuts, the ample direction of Gondry, and the superb screenplay of Kaufman, make this film One of the greats.\n",

      "I love Kate Winslet EVEN MORE after this film. The first hour is a mind-boggling, yet exhilarating experience. Winslet's diversity is on show in every scene she is in and she deserves every award going.Kaufman and Carrey have progressed their talents with this - for Kaufman it feels like a necessary extension to Adaptation and Carrey fulfils the potential he hinted at in The Truman Show.My favourite scene takes place in the kitchen of Carrey's childhood. Winslet and Carrey deliver furiously energetic performances. Both using their bodies perfectly. The interplay is out of this world.On a smaller scale the effects are surprising and in the scenes when Carrey goes back to his childhood they're spectacular.\n",

      "I love this film. It does things for me that few others do. You have your strong heroine, Kate Winslet, and a chopped up time sequence that makes the first 20 minutes very long on viewer patience. (why do producers insist on stopping everything to explain stuff that isn't even technically probable. Think of Star Trek's or any SCI-FI genre's techno-babble. The Greeks had it first--it's IMPROBABLE, okay? That's where the concept of \"entertainment\" begins. More explanation doesn't help.)Kaufman is a genius writer. I checked the time at 1 hour 22 minutes and still the film was teasing and pleasing. You can't tell me this is formulaic at all. Maybe he's incapable of delivering a formulaic film, huh?However, the previous comments about emotional distance in the film is worth mentioning. Though Carrey has learned much about acting, he's not up to the challenge here. Rob Lowe in \"About Last Night\" displayed megawattage more relationship pain than Carrey's character. The viewer can't see a depiction of emo pain here other than Joel Barish moping around and complaining to others. Maybe the producers just \"didn't want to go there\" but I paid for this, and I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING!Winslet's \"Clem\" is among a handful of fully realized female characters in all of commercial film. It should be a bench mark for those caring about this for years to come.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman has evolved as a screenwriter. Both Adaptation and Being John Malkovich were great films, but they were the creation of a confused writer. Kaufman had found a way to share his thoughts and be universal at the same time with this film. Considering other Kaufman scripts, Michel Gondry, the director, had made the most accessible Kaufman movie yet. His unique cinematography and imagery style takes the attention of audience on the story itself, rather than technical wizardry. The story has many layers and as a wise choice leaves the ending to the audience. Jim Carey plays it simple this time. Even in Truman Show he had showed his skills in slap-stick underneath the calm character of Truman. He plays an average guy whom you can relate to. Kate Winslet shows why she is a gifted actress as she is showing the warmth of Clementine beside her edgy side. This movie is brilliant and a huge step in Kaufman's career.\n",

      "This film made me love the characters, (always a good thing) and made me love the writer, Kaufman, even more. Being John M was is one of my top favorite films.When you think about Clem and Joel during the day, what they may be up to these days, that's says a lot about one writer can do. There actually may be only one writer alive, Kaufman, with other writers, Cheyevky, being dead. There's a few others I haven't mentioned.Is the movie so good because It has strong characters or because the theme is so neat? I could go on about the study of memory itself, but Isn't the film really a bitter, romantic comedy and not a science story?One problem with being too rooted in plausibility, is that the story becomes routine, like a trip by air to Hong Kong. Whereas that theme might have been exciting in 1890, it ceases to be currently. So, Watch out for events needing explanation or plausibility. That's quite overrated.\n",

      "How could anyone say 'Eternal Sunshine' is crap? The ideas captured by this movie are brilliant...there is actually a place where you can rid your memory of others by choice. It is a thought that we have all pondered on. What if you went to get someone erased from your mind, but you found out you really loved them? Well, this is how Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) feels as his memories of Clementine (Kate Winslet) are being erased. As his memories are being demolished one by one, he is reminded of the love that they once had for each other. He tries to escape the erasing process by changing the past.The movie is not your typical Jim Carrey movie, his performance was incredible and well worth my time. This is on the top of my list!!!

      "This year has not turned out much in the way of amazing movies. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the exception. Focus Features slogan definitely fits: If we live in a diverse world, why are so many movies the same?Eternal Sunshine is wonderfully written (Charlie Kaufman) directed (Michel Gondry) and acted (Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey, with a solid supporting cast like Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson)The story revolves around Joel, who's shy, withdrawn, and of course nice, and Clementine, who's impulsive, wild and somewhat vindictive. These two polar opposites fall in love. The film begins at the end of their rocky relationship. Clementine impulsively decides to erase Joel from her memory, and he, in response to this news, gets the same process done. However, as he journeys through his memories, Joel realizes how much he still loves her, and changes his mind. He spends the night going from memory to memory, trying desperately to save his memories of Clem.Eternal Sunshine is a perfectly weaved story. Winslet and Carrey give amazing performances, and in my opinion, both deserve and Oscar for it. This film just proves that Jim Carrey is an excellent actor, not just a comedian. It also proves that Kate WInslet IS the actress of her generation. And this is THE movie of 2004. If you like movies, see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\n",

      "Try to wrap your brain around this one. Suppose you could have certain memories wiped from your brain completely? Would you even notice? In theory, the movie says, you wouldn't; in theory, you'd get on with your life as if nothing had ever happened. Ah, but that's theory, and we all happen to live in Theory's sister village of Reality. And most of the time, Reality gets her way.Joel (Jim Carrey) is a dull sort of guy. He's just broken up with a longtime live-in love. He's kind of mopey, kind of aimless, the sort to whom perhaps three-quarters of single thirtysomething males can relate. In short, he's a bit of a loser. He can't even look women in the eye, and in one insightful bit of narration wonders why he falls in love with every woman he meets. But then he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), who's really like no other woman Joel's ever seen. Heck, she's not like many women, period. Clementine clearly dances to her own drummer.But Joel and Clementine have their share of problems. He's mousy and reserved, she's wild and alcoholic. Sure, opposites attract - they also get into screaming matches. Or not, in Joel's case. At any rate, after Joel visits Clementine at work and she doesn't recognize him (!), he stumbles onto an stunning fact: Clementine has willingly had all memories of Joel erased from her mind. Whoa, hold me. This alone is enough to give me an aneurysm. After mulling it over, Joel decides to do the same. Hey, she did it first, so it's OK - right? So he undergoes the procedure. But did it work completely? If so, why does he recognize Clementine sometimes, others not? Why does he relive some of the memories? Is this live, or is this Memorex?The problem is that while Joel is undergoing the process, he decides he doesn't want to forget Clementine - not now, not ever - so he begins to hide her away in parts of his mind where the good doctor and his crew cannot reach. That's all well and good, but now those memories are altered as well, and Joel must outrace his memory erasers in order to preserve his sanity and his love for Clementine.Kudos all around for the cast. Jim Carrey can indeed act, in case some of you weren't sure. He was fantastic in The Truman Show, and he's fantastic here. You see none of the typical Carrey gawking and mugging, and you see all the tenderness and fears of a scared young man. Winslet is pretty good as Clementine, vacillating between cute vixen to unstable alkie pretty seamlessly. A good supporting cast (Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood) helps tremendously.Eternal Sunshine was cowritten by one Charlie Kaufman, who's famed for writing unique films, such as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Sure, there are flaws here and there, but the writing is so crisp and sincere and flows so easily that it's very tough to condemn any aspect of it.If I have any real complaint about the movie, it's that it was perhaps a little too long. At one hour 48 minutes, it's not a marathon, but some parts near the end did seem to drag a big. This is perhaps owing to a rather pertinent subplot involving Dunst's and Wilkinson's characters, but it's a diversion well met.\n",

      "There's a girl or two I would like to have erased from my mind, but just like this movie shows, there were some good times that I had with them that I would like to remember,no matter how much they hurt. This movie did a great job looking at that idea and the way it was presented, which was so confusing at first, looks so clever upon the second viewing of the movie.This movie isn't a sci-fi movie. It takes a little twist on reality, but really, it's not like the whole erasing thing couldn't happen if they tried. The movie had some great acting work, a whole lot of memorable quotes that I know I can apply to my life, and the whole Kristen Dunst story was intriguing too an added an awesome sideline story. If you haven't seen this movie, give it a chance. It'll take you back and make you remember when, but it's worth the trip.\n",

Does that add anything to the film. To me it is so highly implausible, the guy getting brain work done and the two health technicians frolicking and getting stoned...is that supposed to convey that such treatment (in the future) will be totally routine or was it inserted for some cheap laughs. I suspect the latter. Also, is Patrick's telephone call crucial to the film, it seems as though that is the trigger for Joel to start protecting his memories.

That's the good news that emerge from the same screenwriter of \"Being John Malkovich\" - Charlie Kaufman. I don't know much about cinematography, but I like the camera angle and the mood that constructed by the color grading of this movie.

It was a very relatable side, and I'm glad I saw the movie, even though I told myself it was going to be terrible. Everyone involved did a wonderful job, and I like how it never strays from the plot of the movie, in any of the characters - through Kirsten Dunst, to Mark Ruffalo, to Elijah Wood.

      "A thought provoking film so very convincing that makes you believe that the technological advancement might see the memory erasure concept light of the day. Boy meets girl - fall in love hopelessly (that is Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet). They love being in each others company and have ball of time together. After a while the relationship turn sour to the extent that the Kate walks out of relationship, while Jim still latches on.Jim discovers that Kate has undergone the process of memory erasure to remove all the traces of Jim in her mind. In anger Jim decides to go in for the same. What follows is an insight into the Jim's mind and the process of memory erasure. The relationship of Jim and Kate is depicted backward (obviously - removing the latest memory first and moving back to the root!) and how each bit is removed one by one. As it progresses further, Jim discovers that he is undergoing erasure process and regrets it. Now he tries to evade removal of Kate from his memory, which was hilarious in my personal opinion.Its also worth mentioning the way memory erasure is depited on screen which is quite convincing. Jim Carrey is fantastic and his performance is worth mentioning. Kate lives to her character of being impulsive. Elijah Wood character was manipulative and fetish but okay. I was expecting more depth to Kirsten Dunst's character. Wilkinson was okay. After you have erased someone from the memory, what if you bump into the person you loved? How would you cope if you discover that you have undergone memory erasure process? And most important - given a chance to re-live the same situation will it lead to the same circumstances? Watch it - and it echoes in your mind for a long time to come. 9/10How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!

      "I have not been able to stop thinking about this movie since I saw it. Although not perfect, the film is so gracefully and lovingly presented that it more than makes up for any flaws. From the moment the film began, I completely forgot it was Jim Carrey in the lead role. Whoever would have thought that the flamboyant comic could play a withdrawn and shy character with such pathos and sympathy? WAS that Jim Carrey? I still don't believe it. And Winslet, also in a departure from her usual characters, complements him perfectly. I won't say the chemistry between them was perfect, because that word implies sexuality. Although I bought these two as lovers, it was their emotional connection that was so unbelievably perfect. In fact, I appreciated that there were no gratuitous sex scenes between Joel and Clementine which, given the premise, could have easily been included. While more appropriate in this movie than in many others, given the plot, a full-blown sex scene would have cheapened this film.I had some issues: I found the side plot with the technicians and receptionist (interesting supporting roles for Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood, both of whom perform quite well) rather tiresome and distracting. I also was annoyed by the December-May romance, which was wholly unbelievable although it served a purpose. In addition, I was skeptical about these two totally different people being attracted to each other in the first place -- but it is to the actors' credit that they made such a seemingly incompatible couple come together (and fall apart) so beautifully. Perhaps that was the point.Oddly enough, the moment that grabs me and keeps reliving in my memory is the scene in which Clementine \"borrows\" a piece of Joel's chicken. His reaction and their subsequent conversation is so poignant. It's subtle and simple moments like these that make up good movie-making, probably because they're the same ones that make up real life.\n",

      "From the acclaimed writer of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation comes Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a magnificent romance story with so many twists and turns its unbelievable to watch. Jim Carrey gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Joel, who becomes attached to a young and somewhat bizarre woman named Clementine, played perfectly by Kate Winslet. The pair experience a bizarre connection with one another and gradually begin to fall in love. However, when Clementine decides to have Joel erased from her memory because she finds him boring, the story unravels into something more complicated than a romance story but rather an exciting odyssey into the deepest and darkest regions of the human psyche. As a result, Joel decides to have Clementine erased from his memory. However, as the process escalates throughout the course of the film, Joel discovers that he cannot live without Clementine and wants to end the process. What results is a masterful film that should definitely get Oscar nominations for Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Charlie Kaufman has written yet another brilliant screenplay and is probably going to receive his third Oscar nomination for this film. Hopefully, the third time is the charm and he will finally win the Oscar because he is quite simply a brilliant, sophisticated, and totally original writer.

      "\"They say that breaking up is hard to do. Now I know, I know that it's true\" - Neil Sedaka The ability to manipulate memory has long been the stuff of science fiction, inspiring fears of government mind control and films such as the 1962 classic The Manchurian Candidate. In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) seeks the help of a company called Lacuna Inc. to erase the memory of ex-girl friend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) after their relationship has faltered. The film, directed by Michael Gondry and written by Charlie Kaufman, is an exhilarating rush of a movie, a mind-bending trip that centers on Joel's memories as they fade from existence and his discovery that what he and Clementine had was very special despite some difficult moments. Jim Carrey delivers one of his best performances as Joel recalling his dramatic triumph in The Truman Show and Kate Winslet captures the zaniness of her character to perfection.When we first meet Joel and Clementine, they are drawn to each other at a lonely train station in Montauk, Long Island. They could not be more dissimilar. He is a shy, introspective loner who cannot look a woman in the eye. She is outgoing and aggressive with a rebellious spirit that manifests itself in blue hair (this changes with each mood swing during the course of the film). We learn later that the fifteen-minute pre-credit opening was a flashback and that Joel and Clementine have gone through a two-year relationship that ended in a bitter breakup. Joel hopes to win her back but when he shows up at the bookstore where she works to offer her a gift, she acts as if she doesn't even know him. Joel learns that Clementine has used the services of Lacuna, Inc, a scientific company that specializes in selective memory erasure, to wipe out any trace of his memory from her brain. He decides that he cannot bear to remember Clementine and wants the procedure himself. Enlisting the services of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his staff Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood), he agrees to have her memory zapped. Drugged into unconsciousness, Joel lays on his bed wired to a laptop with a helmet on his head that looks like a hair dryer from the 1940s, and begins to relive his history with Clem. The film races through fifteen minutes of impressionistic and often gimmicky camera tricks as Joel re-experiences impressions from the past and attempts to hide the memory of Clementine in inaccessible parts of his brain. In one scene, Joel remembers going into a deserted beach house with Clem but as they argue about whether or not they should be there, the building falls apart around them as the memory is erased. Another incident takes place in Clem's bookstore where the books gradually disintegrate into nothing but blank pages. Gondry shifts back and forth in time from Joel's fantasies to subplots involving the relationship between a receptionist (Kirsten Dunst) and the doctor and between Patrick and Clementine that only serve as a brief diversion from the breakneck pace. As Joel gets in touch with positive things he and Clem enjoyed together, he is reluctant to give up his memories and discovers that beyond his thoughts and feelings lies something deeper, an experience of love that he had not previously been in touch with. Joel finds out that his memory is not just synapses and nerve endings but part of the very essence of his identity, that he can erase conscious memory but not the experience itself. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a somewhat confusing but highly entertaining film that provides an apt metaphor for the union of two beings who learn to rediscover and accept the deepest part of themselves.NOTE: If you think the premise of this film is absurd, think twice. A recent article in the Miami Herald reports studies have been conducted in the U.S. and France with a drug called propranolol that can block the hormones that etch memories in the brain and perhaps deaden the effects of old memories. Ignorance may be bliss after all.\n",

      "I don't know, I'm not quit sure. This is on the top 100. In fact in the top 50. At 37, I was quit impressed. I have been dying to see this movie. I finally swallowed my pride and did the stupid 2 day rental at Blockbuster. Which everyone knows is stupid and not worth it to have a film for 2 days. Now, I thought that the movie was very interesting. There is a point. The acting was very good. There is another point. The editing was great. There is another point. The directing is pretty decent. There is a point. And quit another few to be named. BUT!!!... in some ways I thought this was a pretty average film. Like \"Vanilla Sky\" and \"Wicker Park\", you are confused through most of the movie. I felt also that it didn't end too well. But you could give it a shot, because obviously other people saw something in this film to give it a high rating. 7/10\n",

      "\"Being John Malkovich,\" \"Adaptation,\" \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" all great and all nothing like the run of the mill grist the movie industry usually grinds out. Nice to see big stars willing to take a chance on a script that can't have been easy to follow in written form. This film is well-done, and Jim Carrey shows once again he is capable of more than just delivering one-liners. The film world needs more movies like this and less movies like \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin,\" \"Reindeer Games,\" and \"Maid in Manhattan.\" Boycott the next piece of crap that shows up at your local cinema (Gigli; Catwoman; Coyote Ugly; etc.) and spend your coin supporting projects like this.\n",

      "Well first I'll start with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. haha This is Jim Carrey's second best film next to the Truman Show. He has more talent than most actors these days, 'IN SERIOUS FILMS'. He can't act in comedies, he is terribly over done and so boring especially in 'Bruce Almighty'. In this film he is so brilliant and very worthy of an Oscar.The Oscars next year are going to be a very difficult choice, EG: JIM CARREY = Eternal Sunshine of the SPOTLESS MIND, TOM CRUISE = COLLATERAL, DENZELL WASHINGTON = THE MACHURIAN CANTIDATE and many more. Anyway the story in this film is very complicated and arty. All the photography and acting is just amazing and the sophisticated script is BRILLIANT. I rate this film 10/10 and I recommend people who do not understand ART not to see it as they would not appreciate it.PAUL.............\n",

      "The premise of the plot was easily figured out within the first half hour or so, long before the director reveals the 'big surprise' that the plot revolves around. If you have half a brain, it's insulting. I also got the impression that the director wanted to impress viewers in his weird way, by including, what, 45-minutes of unnecessary mind-warp scenes that are supposed to, I suppose, show the viewer the bond that Jim & Kate's characters had formed in their relationship and how they had come to grow apart .. and wow us with his directing, creativity and unique way of putting on film what he had in his head. It's all very tedious and contrived, but the main problem with the film is that the chemistry between the 2 main lovers is never really believable. In fact, at one point we hear the reasons why they grew apart, leaving the audience to think to themselves: \"Yep.. you were fools - you should have realized that right from the start\". Why pursue something so wrong? By the end of the movie, you'll be thinking \"what was the point?\"I'm not spoiling anything here by pointing out that my above thought is foreshadowed by the other 'pseudo-couple'(Mary). If it ain't meant to be, it ain't meant to be!Jim Carrie was good, Kate Winslet was good. I liked his hat. I didn't like her hair. Elijah was uninteresting. Big-hair boy was annoying & wimpy, and I have to wonder what Kirsten's character might have seen in him (another unlikely coupling!). I have to mention though - the 'geek-at-the-computer-frantically-hitting-keys' scenes reminded very much of the film 'Hackers'. Tap-tap-tap! We're getting close. Damn, he's gone! Yawn...I gave it a 4/10. And that's only because we get to see Kirsten Dunst dance around in her panties..\n",

      "The Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind, although being somewhat dramatic throughout, is nothing than a feel-good movie in the end. What I liked most about the film, were the beginning and the ending. Especially the beginning though, I think, which was very romantic and well made. But the ending was good as well, because it did more than conclude the somewhat weird happening from the middle of the film, it provided a sort of a morale, a tip maybe for people in love and for couples all over the world (or is that just me who got that feeling?). As for the middle of the film, it was a tad weaker than the beginning and the end, yet in it's numerous \"rehearsals\" of the same it never bored or dragged as it might have if there had been worse actors or a worse director. As far as the latter is concerned, he did a good job, but WHAT ABOUT THE ACTORS? Damn, they were great. Well they were all good, and Kate Winslet was great. Maybe it has to do with me being a bloke, or me thinking she is sexy or maybe I just have a bit on a crush on her (or maybe I'm delirious RIGHT NOW) but she really played her character excellently. I just loved her and I could just imagine, sitting there, how it must have been for Clementine with Joel and for Joel with Clementine and yet I felt it was more due to Winslet's performance than with Carrey's. I do not know what it is with her, and I definitely DO NOT like all of her movies (although I've seen a lot and hate none). I sense an Oscar nomination for both her and Carrey. Although I think she'll walk away with one (for this OR Finding Neverland which I have not seen yet) and Carrey will not.7,5 out of 10 (with a spotted 8 given upon voting)\n",

      "I really hate Jim Carrey.Not the man himself, I've never met him and don't claim to know the first thing about him.No, I hate several of the roles he's had and the public persona he's created for himself--the rubber-faced \"wild and crazy guy\", who's asinine, juvenile, derivative, and, worst of all, unfunny. I also hate the achingly pretentious, I'll-get-an-Oscar-somehow-Robin-Williams-did! Jim Carrey too.But I really hate him, most of all, for making me admire him so much in this movie. Damn him for having so much talent after all!He did something I've never seen him do before: he made me forget he was Jim Carrey. Like Robin Williams before him, he suddenly graduated from a comic who does movies to an actual actor, and a damn fine one at that.It doesn't hurt that he's surrounded by so much talent, especially Kate Winslet, showing off just how chameleon-like the best British actors can be; Elijah Wood effectively distancing himself from Frodo; Kirsten Dunst playing shallow to start but somehow breaking your heart by the end; Tom Wilkinson playing the banal, brilliant, and benevolent doctor who turns out to be all-too-human; and of course, a brilliant, typically-original script from Charlie Kaufman (and director Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth).I liked how the story limited itself to just the one science fiction element, and kept everything else realistic. Too often Hollywood forgets the idea of introducing one fantastic element ONLY in a story, and we end up with flying cars whizzing by. Removing the memory of an ex is, like all great SF/horror elements, just a metaphor; haven't we all, after a painful breakup, burned, thrown out, or destroyed all the precious little mementos of the affair in a desperate attempt to purge the whole thing from our brains? The story's not about the SF element, after all. It's about memory, the power of will, and of course, it's about relationships and love.That's probably its greatest strength. This film has one of the most realistic depictions of a relationship that I've ever seen outside of real life. All the ugly arguments and ill-considered outbursts are there. But--and it's brilliant how these are only gradually revealed, and at least halfway through the film--so are the unexpected moments of connection, the sheer, unabashed delight in actually seeing inside the soul of another and having them see into you. And, ultimately, the necessary acceptance of the loved one's imperfections--and their acceptance of yours.This is a great movie.But I still hate Jim Carrey. Because he made me like him. Jerk.\n",

This was the #1 film I have wanted to see the whole year. I never got to see it in theaters, which I wanted to, and now I finally got to rent it at blockbuster. I really like films like these that have a weird meaning to the movie and a lot of things jus change around that confuse you. The acting of this successful film was incredible especially by Jim Carrey, Mark Ruffalo, and Kate Winslet along with Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson.

      "After repeat viewings, it's still difficult to understand if this movie is brilliant or a director's simplistic mind game. Lately though, I'll side with the former. What the movie does is make you think, think about what's going on in the film, and maybe even what's going on in your own life. Because ultimately, we are our memories, and without them, we are merely shells.The disorienting camera angles during Joel Barish's (Jim Carrey) mind wipe procedure create an unsettling discomfort. Joel hears the voices of the technicians Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) as Joel's breakup memory with Clementine (Kate Winslet) is being erased, and he furiously attempts to hang on and not let go. It's a torturous struggle as both the good and bad memories hold sway at different times. What Joel, Clementine, Stan, Patrick, Mary and Dr. Mierzwiak all seek are best expressed in Clementine's own words - \"...you'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, we'll start over\".Probably more than anything, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is about starting over. The futility and frustration of life and relationships are set aside when love conquers petty disappointments, and you have someone who understands you can turn to. Focus on the memories.\n",

I went in expecting something great but the word \"great\" falls short of what it really was. After seeing this film it changed my views on life and love. Walking out of the theater, I felt something which I have felt few times feeling, upon leaving a theater. I felt a sense of completeness. So, (a) there will never be an \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2\" and (b)Everything that wanted to be said was said and that's all there is. Although with this completeness in the film, there is so much already to breakdown in film it needs nothing more. I write this review mainly to inspire those who haven't seen this film to see it. Hopefully, you too may discover these new views on life and love.\n",

      "Before offering a tiny criticism, my husband and I loved this movie. I'm not usually a fan of Kaufman--his movies are just a bit too quirky (esp. Being John Malkovich)--but this one was wonderful. Particularly Jim Carrey's unexpectedly moving performance. Never seen him act as well as in this, probably because he wasn't \"Being Jim Carrey.\" Anyway, I saw only one flaw with the script, but it didn't detract from the movie being wonderful. At the very end, when Clem gets the tape in the mail from Mary, it's been only ONE day since Joel woke up the morning after having his memories erased--so there wouldn't have been time for Mary to take the files home, go through them, put together packets, and send them out to clients. Remember the beginning? The movie opens with Joel waking up the morning after his erasure procedure--and that's the day he meets Clem. They spend the afternoon and night together, then he drives her home the next morning, whereupon she gets the tape in the mail and pops it into his cassette player in the car. Kinda ruins the serendipity of the ending--but it's still a terrific movie, and we really enjoyed it.\n",

      "In (a bunch of minutes) less than two hours i could appreciate a film ignoring everything about it: usually radio and TV advertising tease you about the film and the director's career for weeks.. In this case it was a pleasure to discover only at the end that the man behind the camera is the genial, fresh and unique Michel Gondry: i must admit that every time i saw a Gondry's video, from a Kylie Minogue's \"Come into my world\" or a Rolling Stone's \"Rolling Stone\" or a White Stripe's \"Fell in love with a girl\", i felt \"well, this man is a fantastic child!!\". He plays equally with logic and technologies. And this \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is even better: it gains the completeness of a full-length film. A film that is a closed and perfect circle built upon a simple plot about memory erased. Light years distant from the un-closed and un-satisfactory \"Memento\", \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a surprising oniric flight with a beginning and a end. ..How easy it is to tell to a stranger what we think of our partner and we never say..

No. I mean, who in their right mind writes a movie about a movie actor? Are we celebrating the amazing career of John?Anyhow, I'm not going to get into that movie. I'll talk about ESoTSM. What a stupid acronym. Sort of like NKoTB. First off, the title itself oozes \"I'm a pretentious French film maker\". The sad thing being, I actually thought I was going to get a good film out of the 5.99 I paid to rent this movie. (Yes, I rented it.) Okay, anyone want to say I'm not intellectual enough to watch this film? Bite me. I'm schooled, career oriented, and an avid movie buff. This film was terrible. Haven't we all had enough of these \"artsy\" film makers using the \"shaky camera\" until it gives us, the viewers, a headache? I mean, I thought we had gotten enough of that when Woody Allen started making films.Aside from the migraine inducing camera operation (which could have been equaled by a five year old), the plot was utter crud. Okay, we start with a fairly regular story of a man who suddenly decides to make a difference in his life and meets an outlandishly pretentious \"weird\" girl. Later in the film we learn that this memory is actually the future, and these two have only met once at a beach barbecue. Que the flaws. They only met that one time, huh? So they only met that one time, Jim Carrey walked out, and suddenly they want to erase their memories of each other. BUT WAIT! It seems they haven't only met once. It seems that they have had their memories of each other erased before. Jeez. Strike two, huh?Then, when all else seems to be going wrong, it only gets worse. The film maker introduces a sub plot! Oh my. It seems heir docter actually erased the memory of a young assistant he had an affair with. Okay, does anyone else not really care about this? I sure didn't. In truth, I saw it as an excuse to introduce a plot twist in order to save an already bombing film.The commentary on my DVD was hilarious. Speaking of Elijah Wood and Ruffalo as testosterone times ten? The two biggest fruits in the film industry being spoken of as the manliest of men? Dancing around in their underwear? Sorry, but on this one I'd have to take Vin Diesel over these two goof balls.All in all, the film was a let down. A bunch of untied knots trying very hard to meet somewhere in the middle of something which poorly tries to come together as a story. It's basically trying to tell the world that people who will NEVER get along can still fall in love, even if they constantly want to forget they even knew one another. Is it a glorification of the one night stand? I don't know.If you're bored, watch it. If you want an entertaining movie, rent \"Bubba Ho-Tep\". I can assure you it won't be as disappointing.\n",

      "This is the first Jim Carrey movie I've actually enjoyed!Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a quirky dramedy starring Jim Carrey as Joel, a sort of boring, middle-aged man who desperately needs some interest in his life, and Kate Winslet as Clementine, a very feisty blue-haired/red-head/orange-head/green-haired younger woman who is just the person to give Joel just that.As the movie develops, we discover Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst), and Howard (Tom Wilkinson) all come into the picture as scientists specializing in memory alteration. Now, this is where things would get confusing if the director hadn't used the particular first scenes that he so eloquently did. The rest of Eternal Sunshine is told throughout Joel's memories, which he's been wanting erased. Unfortunately, half-way through the procedure, he realizes he wants to hold on to these precious memories (in lack of a better term)--uh, oh!If you're worried about the content of the movie, other than the swearing, there's nothing really harmful. There's a few joints passed around, and a butt crack courtesy of Ruffalo's character, but it's fairly harmless. Overall, I give it **** out of *****\n",

      "Now, at last some gold among the manure! It's been quite some time since I've truly enjoyed a movie script!This one is sarcastic, inventive, and both cocky and self-mocking, which is a great deal for a movie script. Not many writers/producers/directors in Hollywood dare to say \"yeah, that's a bullshit, of course, and it's been done before, naturally, but what the hell, it's a great movie so shut the **** up and watch it!\" When after about 15-20 minutes of the movie you start to think it's just another \"Vanilla Sky\"/\"Abre Los Ojos\", the authors tell you \"yeah, you got it right, man, but that's life so there's no 3rd millennium wonders with mirror floors here, only a dirty entrance with narrow corridors behind it, and a secretary printing that officially-looking yellow cartons that you probably thought was a sign of wealth on a desktop printer.\"I've always believed that Jim Carrey was a great actor, rubber face notwithstanding, and this movie proves I wasn't too much wrong. In general, the actors do a great job and it's a pleasure to watch it.The only bad (or, better said, not so good) thing about the movie that I can think about now (one day after having it watched) is the most obvious one: it's a marathon movie. In other words, if you don't have enough patience and if the first 20 minutes of the movie didn't get you really interested - you'll quit the race after the minute 25, breathless. The movie is way too long and slow-paced in the middle section, the adventures, although very witty and pretty interesting, become unbearable as a bubble gum after three hours of chewing on it. It starts to feel more like Montmartre than Beverly Hills, which probably has something to do with the fact that the director/co-writer (and the other co-writer, too) are French.Anyways, it's another Charlie Kaufmann's script, pretty fresh, sufficiently ironic, solidly directed and (IHMO) brilliantly playacted. If it wasn't so chewed-on in the middle - it would beat his previous movie - \"Adaptation\", which still remains at the top of my personal list of best scripts in contemporary cinema.If you like interesting movies and mind games, and if you aren't allergic to any of the above mentioned ingredients - than go for it, it's a GREAT movie!\n",

      "What if you could erase someone from your awareness? All your memories of them would be gone...or would it be just the image of the person missing from the memories, with the space and time and various props still in your recollection? That is one huge what-if, and making a movie around that elusive concept is quite a feat. While there were moments I felt uncomfortable and even bored (once I actually figured out what was going on, that is), I still give the writer and director major credit for presenting us with this concept. Here's another thought: If you could completely forget a person you had dated for two years, then you met them on the street, would you be drawn to them for all the same reasons you had been in the first relationship? How many times could two people meet each other for the first time, and find themselves attracted? Infinitely? Or, as the movie hints, perhaps there is a small part of you that never forgets, or something about a person and a relationship that cannot be erased. Call it a theme, an essence, an aroma. Finally, I think one moral of this story is \"'tis better to have loved, and lost, than never to have loved at all.\" At the end of the movie, Joel is vigorously willing to go through any and all pain and heartache that may result eventually, if it means he can enjoy the sweetness of being with Clementine for now, in all her exciting, seriously *&%@ed-up splendor.\n",

      "When you meet someone for the very first time, how do you know that you've never had an encounter with him or her before? Your memories can do so much for you, unless they are taken away. The motion picture Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind devours this theory and amplifies it to a new level.An on your toes 'thinker,' Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet light up the screen, with a little help from Winslet's character's hair color.Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) have a breathtaking relationship. From Barnes and Noble bookstores to icy ponds in the dead of winter, they have been through it all-together. Until one day, Joel stops by Clementine's workplace and finds her unaware of him being more than a customer passing by. The plot thickens when Joel finds out that Clementine has her memory of Joel erased forever in a secret process.Seeing that the title of the movie came from a poem written by Alexander Pope (1688-1744) and the opening credits don't even make an appearance until twenty minutes into the film, this motion picture sure has its eccentricity from any other of the sort.This picture has space for many large names. Jim Carrey (How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Bruce Almighty) uses his personality to portray his character extremely well. Alongside Carrey, Kate Winslet (Titanic, The Life of David Gale) shocked me, to be honest. After Titanic appeared on the silver screen in 1997, she seemed to settle down until The Life of David Gale took the screen. As a major incentive to seeing this movie, the cinematography is spectacular. Transitioning from one scene to the next or from the past to the present may boggle your mind. The camera work adds extra enjoyment to the movie and really adds to difficulty and effect.Concerning the film rating of R, there is mild language, drug use and sexual content. This is a mild R compared to others out there. You will be pleased with the decency of this film in a rating department. There is not a lot of foul or uncouth language with diminutive drug use and sexual content.Taken as a whole, this movie was put together and conveyed really well. A rental in my book and an 8 out of 10 stars, I'd suggest grabbing a bag of popcorn and a friend for an evening of satisfaction towards this movie.

      "I can only agree with John Seger. Watching this film was an ordeal. The first movie in a long while that put me to sleep. (For me this only happens as a defense mechanism or when the soundtrack is way too loud - it's not about feeling tired.) It's the script that stinks. Completely absorbed with being original in shape and style. They should leave that kinda stuff to the French.But the actors do A TERRIFIC JOB. Like good actors everywhere they give it all they've got. Sadly they fell into the wrong hands with these film-makers. Like they were taken hostage and forced to do what they do brilliantly - but in the wrong cause. Jim is great, so is Kate. Elijah is fine and so is the doctor guy.The problem with good actors is they can give life - their life - to a project that should have been shredded on day one. Sad.BUT - the next film Jim Carrey makes I shall rush out to see whatever it is. Just to demonstrate that I love his stuff, his talent, his humor and humanity.

      "This is a movie about a couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). Clementine decides she is unhappy and undergoes a procedure where all her memories of Joel are erased from her mind. When Joel finds out, he decides to undergo the same procedure. Another masterpiece from Charlie Kaufman. Where Adaptation is about Charlie himself and about a screenplay he is writing, this movie goes back to the brain trek from Being John Malkovich. This movie makes commentary on relationships, memories, reality, and the Pandora's box that is technology and medicine. The overall theme that I perceived was most relevant is that without memory or a recollection of the past we are inevitably forced to repeat it (whether we realize it or not). Also that painful, traumatic memories sometimes go hand in hand with the happy memories. When one starts to erase the unhappy ones, so go the happy ones. This is a great movie and I recommended it to everyone.\n",

      "It has to be said, this is something different. Kate Winslet continues her usual acting techniques, which it seems in every film she has made, she has created a different character each time. (For example, from quills to titanic). Winslet's character would certainly not be the same character if director Michel Gondry had chosen a different actressBut, what amazes me most is the role projected by Jim Carrey. Most people will agree he has created a reputation of being a comedian; whether you find him funny or not, this is the genre of the film he usually works in....but here comes this movie, and my response is wow!It seems Winslet and carrey switch their usual roles, Winslet Portraying an out going, slightly odd but cool character, and Carrey a quiet, sensible person, who from time to time may become emotional.I was also interested in the choice of the theme of the film, its highly unusual, and has never been done before. It's not another installment of the Harry Potter or LOTR collection, or even based on a novel; its a brand new idea, very entertaining with many twists and turns in the plot which kept me extremely interested.Excellent job!7.5/10\n",

      "There is not much to criticize on this movie (I rated it 9/10), so here are my two cents:a) A+ story from the man who wrote \"Being John Malkovich\". The story is not \"easy\" (\"like poor underdog gets great girl in the end and they live happily thereafter\"), but if you keep up and follow the story, its great. Its realistic, its fun, its never too technical (the movie actually is about brain surgery here!) ... good mixture of everything!b) The cast ... if you wanna see a great main actor couple, go watch this one, Carrey and Winslet are amazing. They are on a completely different level than Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst, its hard to believe that this is Mr Ace Ventura and Cable Guy together with Titanic woman (I know, both did great movies since then, I'm just pointing out their origins). Carrey will never lose his little craziness, but as this movie showed, he is capable of much much more. When you see him together with Kate Winslet as \"the couple\", you doubt nothing they do or say: They ARE Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski! Affleck, watch this and see how its done!!c) Visual Effects: As this is a more serious (but still funny!) movie, there is no place for alien blasters, explosions or space ships ... but that doesn't mean that producers do not try to fit in as much FX as possible (I'm not judging, I LOVE Michael Bay's Bad Boys :-)) But not in this movie, the crew showed great respect to the storyline but managed to fit in little gimmicks that help the viewer develop its view on the characters. At no time of the movie you get the feeling like \"ahhh thats sooooo unrealistic\" or \"nahhh take it away that doesn't fit!) ... from minute 1 you are more like \"hmmm, actually this could happen in the apartment above me!\" and \"great idea, that a FX that adds an unforeseeable fun element\". The changes of point of view (inside Carrey real, inside Carrey dream, out of Carrey) lets the viewer explore the characters and their surroundings without things getting overwhelming (side story lines ...).\n",

      "If you liked Being John Malkovich or Adaptation (both thoroughly recommended) then you'll like this, another brain-flip movie by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. In this, Jim Carrey realises his girlfriend has had her memory of him and their relationship erased by a sinister corporation, so he does the same. Whilst they're at work on his brain, killing off the memories of her, he realises he doesn't want them to. We see all his memories being destroyed as though in a dream, which is very trippy. The director, Michael Gondry, made some very interesting pop videos including the amazing Chemical Brothers 'Star Guitar' which is shot through the window of a train, and in which passing objects like telegraph poles are incredibly timed to beats of the music. When I first saw the video I was so impressed that my jaw unhinged and crashed to the ground as in an old Tex Avery cartoon, and some of Eternal Sunshine has this same quality to it. Anyway, a very different film, one of those that as soon as it's over you want to watch it again; Carrey and Winslet are good. Also check out the other Kaufman titles if you like films that require some activity of the grey matter.\n",

I felt that the most powerful aspect of this movie and the meaning that I took away from it was that love doesn't have to be 'perfect' to be worthwhile. Too many, if not all, times Hollywood will present movies with a romantic angle that are cookie-cutter perfect. Its always this perfect guy meets some perfect girl they have this perfect romance with some trite easily-overcome problems within. I loved the fact that the characters in this movie argued, and over stupid things, so much like real life. For me the fact that they argued made the love more real, the movie shows that love has good and bad sides that one must expect. If you expect your love life to be like a generic \"romantic comedy\" you will find yourself eternally let-down. One of Kate Winslet's early lines in the move cracked me up, when Carey's character calls her nice and she says shes \"a vindictive b***h\"I thought Jim Carey did a great job in staying away from 99% of his usual facial mannerisms and I really bought his character. I also really bought the chemistry between the two leads. I think Clementine embodies many characteristics that Carey's char (I forgot his name) wishes that he had the courage to be. I think the reason he was attracted to Clemintine was that she has the ability to do exciting, spontaneous things that he could never do without her. And in doing so he feels liberated to an extent, but also resents her freedom from social constraints to a degree.I also really enjoyed the way the filmmakers superbly captured the surreal sequences of the film, I dint find it boring, there were interludes but I had such a vested interest in the film at that point that I was along for the ride. The ending did seem like they had to search for a way to tie it together ,(in terms of the whole dunst romance angle) but really can anyone out there come up with a better ending? In closing there is no such thing as a 100% original film, just because all of the subject matter is not 100% original does not mean that the film cannot give a completely different take and angle on an old idea. I would be willing to bet that the works of phillip k dick influenced this film greatly. And this is one of the few romances on film that I have enjoyed greatly.\n",

      "Am I being over the top here? I don't think so. To anyone who's ever had writer's block, this film is the cure; at least for me. Kaufman has a great talent for getting to a the core of a premise and then bringing it to fruition as a feature script. In this one he starts with the simple concepts of memory and emotion. Think about what you would do if you wanted to make a film about those two concepts. Of course, he had collaboration on the story with Gondry and Bismuth; and I am unaware of who is responsible for what. But, as the extra features on the DVD explain, the premise is based on the postcard device. Suppose you saw a postcard in the mail from your recent ex, that stated they had you erased from their memory? The implications and suggestions from that premise make for a great story. As Carey also stated, Kaufman is completely original with the story. That makes for a great excitement in doing the film. For Carey, Winslet, Kaufman and Gondry, being a part of this film must be like achieving the self-actualization that Maslow spoke of. How incredible.\n",

      "I feel the need to add that the soundtrack is particularly haunting. we all know that soundtracks can be spotty incoherent slapdash mixes that serve only as a marketable product that accompanies a film (like a teeshirt does a concert). but there are some beautiful sounds here. the producer,Jon Brion (who hosted other marvelous film faves as Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love) (He was in a fairly fun band,The Grays in his early garage days) knows how to charm you and float around in yr head. Along with his personal work, this soundtrack highlights a fine cover of the Corgi's one hit wonderful \"Everyone's Gotta Learn Sometime\" by BECK. if you liked the movie...\n",

      "Should we be surprised. Kaufman has written another spectacular one. If all love stories could be like this one, chic flics would never exist, and what a wonderful world this would be. This is a must see movie for anyone who has ever had regret for being in a relationship and this will soon become the ultimate \"break up\" movie. The acting could have been better but it really doesn't matter. I think someone else could've done a better job than Carrey and Winslett. They were out of they're element here and it showed. I'm a huge Carrey fan and am really rooting for him, but he didn't do it for me in this movie. But that's just nitpicking b/c the movie stands alone and Carrey does well enough for me to get by. This movie truly relates to feelings of breaking up and sort of works backwards than most movies. Because Kaufman wrote it, it's very original and enjoyable. This is a must see movie for this year and is easily one of the best I've seen this year.\n",

      "I have to admit I went into this movie feeling a bit skeptical considering I really hadn't heard much about it. But my love for Jim Carrey is what made me even consider it...and I was extremely impressed with what I watched.Jim Carrey gives such an incredible performance that you can truly feel what his character is going through, and they say if an actor can do that, then they have done their job. Well he was outstanding.This movie actually made me think of all the \"what ifs\" that I have allowed to past throughout my time, and I love when a film can do that for me.It captivated me and I think that if you've ever been in love, then you have to give this movie a chance. It is totally unlike anything I've ever watched and through these characters no matter how big or small, you will find a piece of yourself, and you don't even have to look hard.\n",

      "It's very rare to see something that moves completely. In recent history the best films are ones that shock you and open your mind to new thinking. It's rare to see a film which doesn't need to shock you but is truly special.For those of you reading this who think that this is another Jim Carrey movie, complete with idiotic gaffs, slapstick and stupidity through and through, be surprised. Jim Carrey has already proved, I believe, to be more than a comedian when he did The Truman Show (which I really must see in full). But even that had Carrey's traditional moves, and from what I saw I would never believe that he could pull off anything like Joel Barish. This man should do more stuff like this. If he doesn't it is a waste of talent and those who have been paying attention to my previous comments will know that from me that's quite a compliment. In my eyes this man has finally become an actor. I think that's reason enough to see this.Here we have two people: Clementine is an external representation of what Joel is on the inside. They're stuck in a hate-love relationship which has given them the happiest and the worst moments of their lives. Yet, Clementine decides, on a lark, that she would rather never remember anything about Joel and so erases him from her memory. And, almost in revenge, Joel does the same thing to her. And regrets it quickly after he realises that his good memories far outweigh the bad ones, and so tries to take his decision back.Accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack and great acting from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, you'd be a fool not to see this.\n",

      "I found this movie told a typical movieland story that is one of romance in an unusual, and like most Charlie Kaufman screenplays, thought provoking way. The movie made me feel good afterwards and while it's not airtight in its logic it has a few 'and then what happened' kind of moments where they are needed. Having said that it is a bit on the slow side, the characters are just alright and the scenarios are interesting but not really explored in a truly funny belly laugh kind of way or a 'hey thats something I never thought of' or thats a really unusual perspective. Having said that it is fairly inventive and convoluted enough to make most cave men and women leave scratching their heads though I don't think movies should be made for the dumbest mind on the planet so I couldn't care less if my fellow trogledytes get it or not. I would like to see Kaufman's ideas put together with a funny writers gags and routines now that would make a fine movie. If there is supposed to be something funny in ESOTSM it didn't register for me. Having said that it was good and it is worth a viewing.\n",

      "I just had to add a huge raving review for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I think it's one of the best movies I've seen in a really long time. Very creative, very original, it's one of the greatest love stories of the deepest kind, but yet so much more. It has an enticing storyline, excellent acting, and the visual presentation is spectacular. I'll have to admit that in some ways I was a little reluctant to see the movie. I haven't been a huge fan of Charlie Kaufman's work to date. Don't get me wrong. I like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, but I don't necessarily love them. Eternal Sunshine keeps the quirky creativity that is trademark Kaufman, but the tone of the movie is so much different. It's intelligent, but not condescending, thought-provoking, yet entertaining.All in all, if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it without reservation.\n",

      "Hey, i saw the movie last night and was literally swept off my feet. I'm still shocked. It really was the best movie I have ever seen. I haven't seen that many of Charlie Kaufmann's movies - only this one and Being John Malkovich ( also a movie which enters the human mind!). I've heard great things about Adaptation. I'm definitely going to see that movie after having experienced Charlie Kaufmann's genius.I'd like to hear more comments about what the movie did for you. The message that comes across in the movie, I think, is a brilliant message. And the way it's presented is fantastic. I am a seriously a more informed and really better person for having seen this movie!\n",

      "Kind of cool concept film, exploring ideas, quirky characters and relationships. Although Carrey has some funny lines and some funny situations its not really a funny film. In addition to Carrey as the quirky boring guy who does not quite fit in, which is a stable of a certain genre of literature/movies, the other actors in the film are well worth watching. (Other QC in the world, \"L'Etranger by Simone\", \"Philip K. Dick's Jack\", Kafka's Penal Colony, a black and white movie called I believe \"The Following\", etc, etc) - Kate Winlset as Carrey's impulsive high mtc high intensity techno-colored haired intellectual lover. - Wilkinson does a great job as playing the doctor - Woods and the Ruffalo are great as the detached technicians with no respect for their client's property. Like the guy's who work on your car or perhaps the guy at the funeral home when the family's not around, ... Most of the incidental comedy in the film come from these guys.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindJoel Barish goes to meet his girlfriend Clementine one day only to find that she does not know him and finds out later that she had her memory of their relationship erased, no explanation given and none to be found. Joel in his misery decides to do the same so he can overcome his grief.This artsy movie plays with the time line and if you don't understand the story going in you could get either lost or frustrated. It was also unusual in that the beginning credits show up about 20 minutes into the story. The movie begins in the present and then switches to the past where we find Joel in his grief as the beginning credits start. We are then taken through the process of Joel having his memories of Clementine erased. During this sequence Lacuna Inc., the provider, presents us with a most severe case of doctor/patient confidentiality breach and irresponsibility that may have you thinking twice about trusting anyone again. While unrealistic in scope these scenes generated some expletives from me during the movie. The procedure on Joel is completed returning us to the present and we now have a much better grip on how this movie began and finally discover why Clementine and Joel chose the procedure. That crucial bit of information brings the art of this film full circle for a final mind bending and thought provoking view on intimate relationships that had me fast rewinding the complete movie in my mind for a final wow!The IMDb seems hard pressed to find a genre that this movie fits stating, drama, romance, sci-fi and comedy for this listing. The DVD cover promotes it as a comedy. All apply except comedy unless you find people being cruel to each other, incompetence or utter stupidity funny, i.e. Lacuna Inc. This is a new trend for Hollywood as of late which they call comedy and I seem to be unable to find any humor in. I would definitely label this as a drama with award winning potential in many categories. It certainly has it's humor but only as a natural progression of the tale that is being told.Is it the name Jim Carry that forces Hollywood to market his movies as comedy? For me Jim has had a riddled past of great and mediocre films. Ace Ventura and The Mask presented us with the smart comedy side of Jim. Liar Liar is the ultimate classic that derives all of it's humor from the pressing seriousness of the situation playing into Jim's shtick beautifully. The Truman Show was his first real attempt at drama which would have played far better if they would not have promoted the typical Jim Carry comedic delivery through out which was simply at odds with the context of the story. I really liked that movie and the message it provided but alas Hollywood and it's marketing foibles is what prevents it from being a classic. This new movie presents us with the full dramatic potential of Jim Carry while leaving his typical shtick behind proving finally that this man should be considered a serious dramatic actor capable of various parts. The rocky life story of Jerry Lewis cries out for the actor Jim Carry! Maybe this movie brings Jim to a point where he could provide that potential Oscar winning performance as that story will require him to make us laugh and cry with tears in our eyes in both cases.A lengthy review means mis-perception could spoil the film, I lack confidence in my recommendation or the presentation does not follow our normal expectations and in this case it seems to be all of the above. For the life of me I cannot figure out why my wife did not like it. Was it the artsy presentation? She did mention her frustration a few times during the movie. Was it the gut reeling conclusion that ultimately was too realistic causing self reflection? Was it the despicable behavior of Lacuna Inc.? She waffled as I tried to figure out what her take was which left me with only one question to ask her, 'Would you recommend the movie to a friend'? No was the final response.This movie will not leave you with romantic fuzzy feelings and is not your typical chick flick romantic genre. I would suggest the reason this movie failed in the market is because it was too realistic in driving home it's point about long term intimate relationships and true love causing too much inner reflection for the viewer, especially women. One could say this is a guys version of a chick flick that guys would appreciate. This is not simple entertainment for an evening of smiles and gushy romance only.For me this was an excellent example of the application of art to story telling and cinematography promoting thought for this viewer at every turn rather than just mere 'boy meets girl' romantic entertainment.Highly recommended!\n",

      "How refreshing to watch a film which doesn't assume its audience is braindead. Outstanding script (although I'm onto your formula Kaufman!), magical directing - not just great performances, but wrapped up with brilliant special effects around time/memories/changing scenes.Quick time-out: if you're not familiar with Michel Gondry, you're in for a treat. He's the visual genius behind music videos like Bjork's Hyperballad & Joga, Chemical Brothers' Star Guitar and Let Forever Be, White Stripes' Fell In Love With A Girl, and many many more. You can see them on a 'Directors' DVD, which I highly recommend - and where you can see all the techniques (and more) which are used in Eternal Sunshine.. It's best described as 'stage magic'; although most of it is post-production, a lot of things are traditional tricks with lighting/scenery/camera shots/stop-motion, and no obvious 'Attack of the Clones' glossy CGI nonsense (although that's fun too). Michel Gondry: write that name down!Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet are both brilliant in these straight dramatic roles, with good support from Frodo, Kirsten Dunst and others. I'm sure there's an explanation somewhere of why comedians are so good at drama (something to do with huge demands on stage material, internal pathos etc.), and Carrey doesn't disappoint.You finish the film with enormous affection for the characters, and find out why, in love (and life), the bad is as important as the good. Which we should all know anyway, but it's nice to be reminded in such an imaginative way. And there's nothing wrong with nice. Honestly.\n",

      "I fell in love with this movie right from the start. The director hit every note perfectly from beginning to end. It's well paced and the cinematography is first rate. Technically there's nothing to complain about. The visual effects are believable, but all this only take the backseat to what really stand out in this film - The script and the acting. I've never been a fan of Kate Winslet, but here...WOW! She's brilliant. Her performance is flawless. Her character, Clementine, is a multi-dimensional, layered, complex woman, and Winslet really brings her to life. It will be difficult for the Academy to overlook this in February next year. And then there's Jim Carrey. Once again I'm impressed with what he can do. He's probably one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, despite the fact that he has proven himself over and over again to be a rock-solid dramatic actor. I would actually love to see him in an Anthony Minghella-movie.When it comes to the script I can only tip my hat, and say congratulations. You've done it again, Kaufman. It's reassuring to know that the US still can produce great films with good stories and real, human characters in them.See this movie, but stay away from Lacuna, Inc., because this is a movie you don't want to forget.\n",

      "I was expecting this film to be the best film of 2004, but sadly I was disappointed. Not by the superb performances, or the very original screenplay, but by the sloppy directing of Michael Gondry.This film misses Spike Jonze who brought us Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Gondry's work on Human Nature is much more tidy, and more of a pleasure to watch.Overall I'd recommend that you see this film, unless of course you're a die-hard Jim Carrey fan who thinks he's going to see Ace Ventura 3. (and no it doesn't exist, I just got bored and felt like writing that.)\n",

      "This film is the latest from the wonderfully twisted brain of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. The basic premise of the film is what if you could erase something from your memories? When Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) finds that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has erased him from her memories, thanks to a company called Lacuna Inc., he decides to do the same, only to realize that along with all the bad and painful memories, he is losing all the good, happy ones too.The film has a great script and is well made by director Michel Gondry. The film's world is realistic, without any of the hi-tech you might think of from a science-fiction film, but then this isn't really about the science-fiction elements.The acting is superb, especially from Jim Carrey who plays a very shy, retiring person and gives his character a great deal of subtlety.Most of all this is a beautiful, genuinely moving film about love with all it's pain and heartache and all it's wonder and magic too.\n",

      "I have no problem with this movie. It is, at best, a good high concept film. Good mind-bending stuff. What I have a problem with is how the studios insist on publicing movies as something that they're not. Now, I admit that I was going to rent this movie regardless of what it said on the box. I like the writer, I liked the previews... what I don't understand is why the studio found it necessary to sell it as a hilarious comedy on the box. It is not a hilarious comedy. It is a good film in other ways, but by no means is it a hilarious comedy. It's not a comedy at all. It's a drama, and it may be Jim Carey's best roll to date, in that he plays a rather subdued person, which is in stark contrast to the character we all know him to be. So many films suffer from false advertising... why make this out to be a comedy when it's clearly not? Plenty of viewers would appreciate this film as a high concept drama. The thought process of the studios continues to confound me.\n",

      "Just to let you know after the 2nd paragraph here, I will talk about parts of the movie. So, if you haven't seen it please don't read anything after the next paragraph! This is one movie you can't miss or have spoiled for you. I thought a good way to describe it was to say it's a love story even for people who don't like love stories. Trust me, just make this movie your first priority as far as entertainment goes, you will be thankful for the advice. It will be the best 20 bucks or so you will ever spend on a DVD. Also, if you can handle the emotional waves of this movie I bet you can't watch it just once! Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was, by far, the most emotionally draining experience I have ever witnessed on film! It's been 4 days since the first time I watched it, yet I find myself still thinking about it all the time, it's almost like an addiction! I've never watched a movie before that left me with such strong emotions running through my bones. It was so wonderful that I signed up on to this IMDb just to write a review for it. My advice to all is to go out and purchase this movie! For anyone that hasn't seen it, I would suggest not reading about any of the parts in the movie. Trust me, you don't want to have anything spoiled by hearing or reading about the movie. Just watch it and let the movie work it's magic. I do suggest watching it twice because for me the 2nd time was even better than the first time. I honestly can't find words strong enough to describe how good this movie was and still is. I guess to sum it up, anyone with a heart should watch this movie, you will be blown away by the story that unfolds. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE PLEASE DO NOT READ ON, I MIGHT MENTION SOMETHING THAT COULD RUIN IT FOR YOU!!!!!OK if you are reading this then you have seen the movie or just don't care about the spoilers...I find it impossible to watch this movie just once, actually every time I watch it I discover more and more things....like when Joel meets Clementine on the train and she tells him not to make fun of her name. She starts singing \"oh my darling, oh my darling\"...yet he acts as if he had never heard the song before. Then as the movie goes on, it all made sense because he had that part erased from his memory. I just thought that some people might not catch that right away and that was a great little tidbit about the movie. It was just amazing how this story was told. The way the movie takes off When Joel closes his car window after waiting for Clementine to get her toothbrush the first time around was just amazing. Here you are watching this wonderful story unfold of how 2 people meet and the floor just drops out from under your feet. Watching the 2nd time, you know these are 2 spirits connected and their love for one another carries on even after that special connection is severed. Watching the first time I had so much anticipation because I wanted to know how things would work out, while at the same time hoping it would indeed turn out OK. The second time I got to experience both of them connecting through Joel's memories and how there were so many good things for them to build upon.For me, there were 4 words spoken in this film that might be some of the most powerful words ever spoken. It didn't hit me as much the first time I watched it but the 2nd time I got goose bumps and just cringed like I had just experienced the most amazing thing ever...The 4 words were from Clementine during the last memory scene where the beach house is crumbling away. I'm actually getting goose bumps just thinking about it right now! Anyway, the 4 words are when Clementine tells Joel to make up a goodbye and she whispers in his ear \"meet me in Montauk\". That to me right there was simply magical! Here we are with Joel watching his last memory fade away and somehow fate steps in and starts it's process of bringing him back to Clementine. You can see right there that the special connection they have carries on even beyond having their minds completely wiped of one another.I hope some of the things I said were useful. The movie is so powerful and emotional that it's hard to describe it with a few words written on the screen here. The only way to get on the same page as myself would be to watch the movie and let it into your soul. Only then can you experience what I believe is the greatest story of love and fate ever told.\n",

      "There are so many films that have had talked about relationships. But it is a rare treat and rarity to see a film that goes into the heart of love and relationships. I saw this movie after almost a year since my relationship with my b/f (and the father of our son) have broken up. I found myself crying and even wishing that there was such a technology that can remove all memories of him and of our relationship. But then I started to remember the really good times he and I had shared and most importantly the child that he had created together. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" tells the story of Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey in his best performance and I hope he receives an Oscar nomination for best actor) who finds out that his ex-girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had all memories of their relationship erased by this medical procedure run by Lacuna, Inc. Out of bitterness and revenge, Joel also sets out to have her erased completely. But during the procedure, Joel has actually stepped into his brain and looks at his memories from a different of view. He begins to see the wonderful and happy memories that he and Clementine had shared and realizes that he does not want to lose them. While Joel's mind is being erased, Clementine has started a new relationship with Patrick (Elijah Wood), who was assisting in the erasing of her memories and tries to get her to forget. I loved this story and it made me feel sad. The bitterness and heartbreak of a love that is fading and the desire to be rid of such pain, but at the same time how strong a love can truly be. The whole point of the story is that while love is not only painful and hard, it is also something that redeems and is always forever. I hope that my ex sees this film and begins to realize the importance of what was once ours and that maybe one day we can learn from each other in order to move on with our lives.Jim Carrey is absolutely wonderful and Kate Winslet is lovely and funny and she has such wonderful scenes with Carrey. Winslet in this film has proven once again that she is a true leading lady and plays her character with vulnerability, quirkiness, zaniness, and a sweetness that makes her character so endearing and sympathetic. A wonderful film and beautiful screenplay by Charlie Kaufman who is the brains and genius behind \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation.\" I loved this movie and it is one of the best of the year.\n",

      "Simply put, this is the perfect movie, and it is now my favourite of all time. There is no ands, ifs, or buts about it. This film is an absolute Masterpiece. While the basic plot of the film involves memory erasure, the film is far more than that. The philosophical themes behind memory and consciousness are meticulously explored, and the film will leave you thinking hard about your own memories, and if you would go through the same procedure if put in Jim Carrey's Place.Speaking of Carrey, he absolutely Shines here. He has come a long, long way since Ace Ventura and In Living Colour. Here, he gets to show his entire (wide) range of acting talents. From Fear, to Sadness, to even some of his patented slapstick, Carrey shows how great of an actor he really can be, and if he is denied yet again for an Oscar nomination, there is simply no justice in the world. The rest of the cast is no slouch either. Kate Winslet nearly steals the movie away from Carrey, which says a lot, considering his brilliant performance. Winslet should be up for a supporting Actress nod here. The rest of the cast performs admirably, from Mark Ruffalo's clumsy operator, Kirsten Dunst's stoner secretary, Tom Wilkenson's swarmy doctor, and last but not least, Elijah Wood's performance as another operator with a hidden agenda. The good performances stem from great directing, and a sublime script. The Director manages to get very convincing performances and emotions from an admittedly bizarre and unlikely concept. Further credit to the director, is his very clever use of special effects in the scenes where Jim Carrey is losing his memories, they're subtle, and you may not even notice many of them, (keep your eyes peeled in the book store, as only the categories of books disappear at first!). Major Kudos go to the director.As for the Script, all I have to say about that is that Charlie Kaufman is officially a certified Genius. I was always under the persuasion that he and his fictional alter-ego Donald were completely robbed of their Oscars for Adaptation (which, until I had seen this film, was my favourite movie), but this script blows even that masterpiece out of the water. Well developed Characters, fascinating concepts and situations, and finally, the most mind-blowing plot twist since Luke discovering who his father is.There's something for everyone in this movie. There's something for the person looking for romance, Comedy, Drama, philosophy, or just a wonderful time at the movies. You will weep at the end of this movie, not because of the emotion passed on the screen (Although that's a probably too, even though the ending is left wide open), but because you will come to the realisation that your time with these wonderful characters has come to an end.10 out of 10\n",

      "Profound and emotionally poignant, Eternal Sunshine will strike a cord with anyone who has experienced the spectrum of emotion that being in love brings. It deals with the pain that is caused by our love when it fails, and how strong our desire to forget it can be. No pain is greater than that which tears our heart apart- the very core of our body- yet Eternal Sunshine explores the value of the positive memories that are associated with the root of this pain. *The next paragraph may contain minor SPOILERS*Jim Carrey proves his dramatic acting talent in the role of Joel Barish, the introverted and realistically awkward protagonist who discovers that his girlfriend, Clementine, has had every memory of their two-year relationship erased by a doctor working for a company named Lacuna, Inc. Distressed, Joel visits Lacuna to receive the same treatment concerning his memory of Clementine, and an unraveling of memories begins- with Joel inside his own head as the memories disappear. As the process continues, the memories become a little sweeter to hold on to- and while Clementine's depth of character is gradually revealed we see that Joel would rather keep this love- despite the pain caused. The passion and conviction Joel feels comes out as he stands on a frozen lake within his own memory and yells, 'Can you hear me? I don't want this any more, I wanna call it off!' Unfortunately, the process cannot be halted and Joel is forced to try to fend off the process from inside his own head. As each memory is played out, the connection between Joel and Clementine gets stronger, until the emotional climax that is brought by the memory of the day they first met.While Jim Carrey's performance as Joel is noteworthy, it is Kate Winslet that shines in her role as the beautiful, quirky and emotionally insecure Clementine. Her up-tempo personality that changes moods with the wind is portrayed with truthful accuracy and a reality that Winslet nails perfectly. The minor characters are also well acted on the whole- Elijah Wood portrays a pathetic loser who aids Mark Ruffalo in the technical procedure of the erasure, and even Kirsten Dunst manages as a secretary with a not-so-subtle crush on Lacuna's uninspiring doctor, played by Tom Wilkinson. Enhancing all of these performances throughout the film are the outstanding score and beautiful direction of Michel Gondry. The music flows with every conversation, and enhances the mood of each scene. Whether it is the awkwardness of two people first meeting, confusion of the erasure procedure, or a resigned loss of hope for holding on to a fading relationship, every atmosphere is created by the musical backing, and camera angles that enhance the emotions of the characters. By the end of the film we feel connected to the characters and are set up for a satisfying ending to a satisfying movie experience. There are two things that this film screams to its audience. The first is that the pain of a lost relationship is not even comparable to the joyful memories that accompany a relationship or the impact that relationship has had on your life. Erasing the pain that living life brings is to deny life completely. The second is that there is a certain attraction that exists between two people, deeper than looks, emotion, and even memory, which simply cannot be erased. When two people are drawn to each other, something deeper connects them with an unbreakable bond, no matter what happens between them. While watching Eternal Sunshine, one must leave a scientific mindset and technical understanding behind, and simply enjoy the lush treat this movie will provide for your heart. This film will cause laughter, confusion, a reality-check, and possibly tears to those who view it, but most importantly it will teach you about life. Personally, I thank you Charlie Kaufman for writing such an ingenious and poignant story that hit me right in the center of my wounded heart. I give it a 9.28.\n",

      "I just watched the movie and I had to get to my computer to see what others said. This is one of those movies that will float around inside your head for days. I wont give anything away, but I was really having a hard time understanding the movie until the last 20 minutes or so, but then it all came together and it was simply brilliant. Like standing in front of one of those 3d posters blurring your eyes until finally the object you know is there magically appears. I don't know if anyone else noticed a similarity to the movie \"Jacob's Ladder\" starring Tim Robbins, but it did have some of that feel. I will definitely watch this movie again. A masterpiece.\n",

      "I know you're all going to be ridiculously angry at me, but...I thought the filmwriter had an incredible idea and I applaud it. I liked the way he used the theories that love conquers all and that what's meant to happen will, but honestly, I don't think the film itself was that original. A lot of it was actually highly predictable, something I wouldn't expect from Kaufman.I admit that Gondry did a great job with the filmography; it couldn't have been easy. But from Kaufman I expect something highly original out of the whole film, not just the basis. Granted, there are a few slight surprises. You expect Mary to have loved/been with Howard. You even expect something to happen before the end of the movie. You DON'T expect Mary to have had the procedure, or for her to send all the materials back to all the 'victims,' something that bothered me immensely. Obviously the people who had it done, had it done for a reason; all she's resurrecting is pain.Secondly, the Clementine on the train is a completely different person from the Clementine who Joel met originally, a fact that also got to me. She was funny and winning the first time. The second, on the train? She was just annoying. I want to like Clementine. I liked her the rest of the movie. But in that scene, one that was dragged out for far too long, she just seemed like a petulant child for a great deal of it. The only good part was when she told Joel she likes it that he's nice.Whereas in a movie like Donnie Darko, everything falls into place to make you go OH, MY GOSH, I GET IT, in this movie, everything falls into place too late, so you have no CLUE what's going on 'til the end. A lot of things seem to be happening out of place, and Kaufman doesn't give you any semblance of a hint, which would be nice in getting the gist of the movie.Even the title completely misrepresents the movie. Yes, it comes from an Alexander Pope quote, but it makes you think maybe something good happens to those who can't remember, maybe it would make Joel's or Clementine's life happier. All the procedure does, though, is cause Joel pain. He spends most of the movie trying to fight it off. Similarly, 'spotless mind' makes you think maybe something accidentally happened and they erased his whole memory. That would make the movie all the more interesting. But no, he just doesn't remember Clem for a few weeks, and then they get back together again.Don't get me wrong, when I got it, I gasped and said I GOT IT! and all my friends laughed at me, 'til five minutes later when they all went I GOT IT! It's a liberating feeling, and it's kind of fun to know you understood something before they told you what it meant. And it's enjoyable if you just want a Friday night flick, but just don't go in expecting pure brilliance. You may be disappointed.\n",

      "It's arrived! A truly original and provocative film (and it includes special effects!). The combined talents of great actors and people disapearing in front of your eyes. Forget about Michael Bay. This film has that scenerio of special effects without becoming dumber. But, on a serious note. Carrey delivered and Oscar worthy performance. It's great to finally see a film that has creativeness (see I make up words, that's creative) to it's context. There are few movies coming out in the last 5 years that have made you truly believe, \"Damn that was a cool movie!\". What's even more amazing is that there were no exploding cars or robots taking over the world.\n",

      "Prepare to bite your lip if you're watching this with friends. I caught myself getting choked up a few times in this movie. With it's Bang-on, completely convincing acting, innovative writing of completely realistic relationship scenarios and reactions to them, and effective cinematography, sequencing and effects, I felt as though this movie was speaking directly to me. Almost every review I've read have been very positive, but I HAVE heard this movie called pretentious and even clich√©d..Clich√©d, NEVER. A movie about erasing part of your brain, running through your memories and meeting someone for the 1st time twice is over done? Come on, we know that isn't true.Pretentious, personally I cannot see it; indy-ish, actual substance-based movies do not automatically = pretension. When you've got a cool idea that's well executed by all parties involved, that's just a good movie - period. Perhaps these people just can't relate; I can't lie - I find movies like the English Patient and Shine pretentious, mostly because I can't relate.Anyway, a VERY moving and skillfully constructed movie. Go out and buy it!\n",

      "Just because a movie is confusing and hard to understand doesn't mean it's great. A movie of this kind is either simple so obviously it has no mistakes, or is complex bs so it has no obvious mistakes. There was no moral in this story, but how sci-fi is trying to be introduced into reality. People who think this movie was great are usually just trying to seem as if they are somewhat intelligent and know what's going on while others don't. This just shows who these people are, and in fact this movie's only purpose might have been even this. I'm not just somebody who doesn't understand but the shallowest crap, I just know when directors are trying to make a movie enjoyable, or they just want a moral out of it, and this movie did neither. This movie just sucked!!\n",

      "I have seen this movie a number of times now and it really is an amazing piece of work. I don't think I have ever been able to personally relate to a movie on the level that I did with Eternal Sunshine. Obviously people who have been through bad break-ups will get more out of this movie than those who have not. I find it surprising that the young crowd is rating this so high because of that fact. I guess that is just more testimony to how great of a film this really is.As for the people who think that this is going to drop in the ratings after it hits DVD, I have to disagree. I think it will only solidify its ranking as one of the best films in this genre ever produced. I just got done reading the trivia section on this movie and read that Nicholas Cage was originally going to be cast as Joel. What an excellent decision to go with Jim Carrey. I have been a fan of his since the Ace Ventura movies and he has really matured into one of Hollywood's best leading men. His acting ability really runs the gamut of all genres. I was also glad to see Kate Winslet in this role as I think she is an under appreciated actress. All in all the casting could'nt have been better. As for the script, well this is easily one of the most original stories I have seen in all my years of watching movies. I guarantee right now that this wins best screenplay at the Oscars and Jim carrey will without a doubt get a nod for best actor. While Kate Winslets performance was great, I don't think she will get a nomination for best actress. So there you have it - Best screenplay & Best Actor for Eternal Sunshine!!!Last but not least, why is there so much debate going on about the top 250 in here. Its not like people are signing up with 400 different email accounts to raise this movie up in the standings. this is a legitimate poll for movies. The fact that it is on this site, probably one of the most popular movie sites, if not the most popular movie site on the net should tell you that these are legitimate scores coming from people who love movies. This is not some poll on the side of the screen on some misc website. This is IMDb and I trust the numbers here more than I do anywhere else. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean its not correct. 50% of the people who rated this movie gave it a 10 for gods sake. If that doesn't tell you something I don't know what does.GotMyOrangeCrush\"My Experiences, though I would wish them on nobody else, have helped make me what I am and what I still hope to be\"\n",

      "A great directing job, balancing originality, striking scenes & purely original drama, while not losing focusand the audience. So incredibly refreshing to see something like this ...an unobstructed, inner-feeling type piece that everyonecan relate to, and is utterly captivated by a movie tellingyou that \"your eyes cannot move from the screen!\" Most importantly, it made me think and it was deep & rich,but it wont take days to figure it out! It hits you hard, and just stays in your mind for awhile after the movie is over.Great job by a great cast & truly innovative, brilliant visionary of a director!\n",

      "I can see the majority of casual moviegoers not liking this movie, as it's a little oddball in the early going, and difficult to get used to; but even those who can only appreciate conventional Hollywood pap will probably be won over by this one.... if they give themselves a chance to get into it. The second half of this movie is an absolute delight - I love the way the story unfolds. The interaction of the cast, the sheer buoyance of the script, and the nice ending completely won me over. Jim Carrey deserves an Oscar nomination, as he entirely abandons his usual goofy persona. Mark Ruffalo is beginning to really impress me with the scope of his abilities. This is basically a six-character ensemble cast, and man, do they ever rock with this script! \"Oscar\" is written all over this one, especially for Charlie Kaufman.\n",

      "This is a wonderful film. One of the most realistic relationships I have ever seen displayed on the screen. Comedy bleeds throughout the movie...you will spend as much time laughing as anything else. I do not want to ruin the film if you have not seen it so i will do my best to hint at my favorite scenes without destroying the wonder of the movie. First my major complaint would be the final moments as the conclusion is drawn further and further out to keep audience in suspense. The love of the couple develops...appearing shallow at moments and deeply profound the next. Decisions made by Jim Carey that he wants to change midstream but not sure how to correct his decision so he must go deep inside to reverse his decisions. At various points a character or two either consciously or unconsciously become the villain with whom Carey must fight with both hands tied behind his back. i wont tell you if \"good\" prevails, but i will tell you that you must watch this movie.\n",

      "If you have an ex wishing to forget all about you, haver him/her watch this movie. This movie ought to make people people think twice before wishing to forget about their ex-lovers.I really enjoyed this film, from beginning to the end. If you'r clever you'll figure out the twist quite soon, but it's still a good twist, and the way it's told is very good. The way the movie was shot, the language of it all, was very... alive, creative and refreshing. Not Hollywood plastic. I liked the ending and the film in it's whole. The parts where Carry's character is trapped in his own memories, fighting to keep them, has a very nice tone to them. The effects blend very well into it all. The character Clementine is also very charming. There's no fake characters, although Elijah's characters shallow, and after the LOTR it's kinda though to see him in this part. I will definitely watch this film again, and I'd recommend anyone to see it. I could wish for more bonus material on the DVD, but it has the standard selection of commentary, documentary and delted scenes plus some more. Watch it and enjoy it. 8.5/10\n",

      "This was one of the best movies I've seen this year. One suggestion though to anyone that likes to read user reviews prior to watching the movie. Read the back box before you start the movie! I don't usually like to pollute my opinions by reading others. Or even read the full jacket cover on something I've been told to watch. I'm glad I didn't, having said that you really have to pay attention in the beginning to fully appreciate this film.Jim Carey has earned my utmost respect as an actor with this film. Fireman Bill is far removed from his persona in this film. After watching the extras on the DVD it appears that Mr.Carey poured his heart and soul into this role using some of his own personal experiences with love to become consumed by this character. This is all self-evident in the 1st 10 minutes.For anyone that's been around a few years and loved and lost this film will envelop you. The unique perspectives obtained in filming allowed for an earthy feel to many scenes. Most all of the special effects in this film were NOT CGI. They, in most scenes, were accomplished by using simple camera angles, \"tricks\" and perspectives. The only puzzling part of this film was, \"Why was Kirsten Dunst in it?\" Aside from a chance to see her in underwear and panties her character could have easily been non-existent. Nothing against Kirsten. I think she's done some interesting work and maybe this was an attempted by her to enter the \"Independent Film\" genre. In fact, I think maybe her placement in this film, given the timing of the initial release, was simply to bolster ticket sales. Don't get me wrong I think she does well as an actress just not here. It would have been interesting to see how her character worked only using the \"mush face\" technique. Kate Winslet....was absolutely amazing in this movie. I really really fell in love with her. She plays the quintessential girlfriend/lifemate. I'm not sure if her character was written or performed but she played every true romantics fantasy perfectly. It must also be said that this was almost a role reversal between her and Jim Carey's typical role. Again as with Mr. Carey I've developed a whole new respect for her acting talent after watching this film. After all this long winded, subtle and puzzling retrospective don't miss this film. I think that films shot, directed and produced in this \"Independent film\" style NEVER get a fair shake, and there's many that shouldn't. This movie was definitely missed by the main stream, but that's OK, I think it's a true treasure with real heart and sustenance.We can all only hope that every burgeoning young film student would strive for the accomplishments of this film and use it as a benchmark.\n",

      "look I rated this movie a ten, and deservedly, but it does bother me just a little that the main characters would be quite so willing to trust someone fairly unknown with erasing their brains... I don't get enough info in the film, as to why this organization is so trustworthy in the eyes of the main characters.... and after you get into the film... well things seem even more... you knowi don't want to give the story away, so I can't say more...but watch it, don't you agree?other than that, I really enjoyed the film, and would recommend it to anyone who has an open mind and a romantic heart... some things harder to find nowadays!\n",

      "i saw this movie in march when it originally hit theaters. it is now the day of its DVD release and my stomach still fills with butterflies when i think of this movie. it was by far the best cinematic experience of my life. the chemistry between the characters, especially joel(carrey) and clem (winslet), is unforgettable. whenever people ask if it was a good movie, i can only reply \"it was a mind f***, and it was the best sex of my life\"let this movie take over your mind and body for and hour and a half, you won't be disappointed.10/10\n",

      "I really think this movie was brilliant. I know that I, for one, and I would imagine many others, have wished to erase bad memories, and I'm glad that someone was brave enough to explore that common thought in the cinema. I was astounded by Jim Carrey's performance, as I'd never seen him in so moving a film. Kate Winslet was fantastic as well. Even though I highly suggest seeing this film, to this day I'm not sure whether I actually LIKED it or not. It's really a great movie, but it left me feeling a little disturbed, as I suppose it should have. I would really like to see it again so I can make up my mind. I feel that after another viewing, I could decide I hate this movie... or that it's one of my favorites. Regardless of my opinion, I think that you should see this movie if you haven't already.\n",
      "1408\n",
      "This movie is really good. I can't put in any other way.The story is cool and is one of those films that it all makes sense after you have viewed the whole thing. From the first part of the movie it is kind of confusing until you see the final portion. The story involves the love relationship between Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) which begins to hit the skids, to put in in simple terms. Clementine decides to erase Joel from her memory. Joel goes to meet her one day, and finds that she does not remember him. He decides to have the same procedure done to have her erased from his memory, though he suddenly has a change of heart and wants to keep his memories of her. The acting is really good from Jim Carrey most of all. It is a nice change to see him doing something other then a comedic role. He plays the role very well. Kate Winslet is also very well at playing the role of Clementine.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something to watch with your spouse. Or if you just want a good movie to watch, rent this one.\n",

It is a roller-coaster ride from the beginning till the end. It shows that true love doesn't die, not even if you erase your loved one from your memory.This is Jim Carrey's \"Leaving Las Vegas\". He managed to refrain from pulling his trademark weird faces and behaviour. Only once in the kitchen scene can he be himself for a little while. The script is what you expect from Charlie Kaufman. A little surrealistic, tender and funny. The other actors shine as well. Kate Winslett has never looked this beautiful.I wish I'd meet a girl like Clementine....\n",

Jim Carey has outdone him self in this role. He proved that he can act, and brilliant too. I wonder why he always played as a comedian?! Winslet is a standard movie diva. She simply can't fail. I very much liked the question that this movie poses... If you ever wanted to erase your ex lover from your memory (i guess a lot of people wanted sometimes) would you do it so simply? Bad memories come along with the good memories. Would you like to erase them too?I think thats the whole point of this movie. And it's beautifully presented. A real lesson for movie makers!\n",

      "Yes folks, Hollywood's produced an original film ! *gasp*Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind seems to be billed as a light-hearted bittersweet comedy, but the truth is much further from this.Jim Carrey features in his joint best role to date (With the Truman Show), as a socially inadequate loner who takes an impulsive detour on the way to work one day, and meets Clementine on a beach in a resort called Montock.Initially awkward around her, she gets into his life but events begin to get confusing as it emerges that she's had him erased from her memory.To divulge more would spoil the plot, and it baffles me that IMDb's outline reveals aspects we don't find out till later.This is a movie which relies on 3 crucial things: a strong sense of a psychological mystery, superb performances, particularly from the 2 leads, and a level of originality I don't remember seeing anywhere else.These 3 combine to grip the viewer at all times and allow the story to unfold in a way which may seem confusing, but which forces the viewer to stick with it, intrigued to learn the truth behind what's going on.The movie is aided by a very genuine performance from Carrey, who excels as Joey and continues to prove that Carrey's Liar Liar days are only one aspect of his repertoire. On the other hand we have the incredible Winslet. Her performance is exponentially more admirable given the fact she's an English actress with an absolutely faultless American accent. I forgot she *was* English such was the natural sound of her accent.Other cast of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson provide A-List backup but you can't help but feel they're all a bit wasted here with such comparatively minor roles. Particularly Dunst who's now surely, along with Wood, a leading lady.Anyway, I nitpick. This is a great film with a lot of impressive elements to it. Maybe not the greatest film ever made, but premier league certainly.Recommended.\n",

      "Simply amazing film has two eccentrics (Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) falling head-over-heels in love after a chance meeting on a subway and spending the day together. But after a rough breakup the two decide they want each other 'erased' from their memories. The film follows Joel (Carrey) as he undergoes the process; entering the mind of him as his memories are being erased. This is perfect film-making at work. Charlie Kaufman's screenplays are always brain-teasers/puzzlers and this one is no exception. Right when you think you get it, you figure out you don't and you keep trying to pick it apart. That's only half the fun. Michel Gondry does a fantastic directing job as we pass through Carrey's crumbling mind; he combines eeriness, surrealism, absurdity and makes it all come alive. As for the cast; Carrey and Winslet have never been better. Mark Ruffalo is a standout in support as the man erasing his memory. This one will stick with you for quite some time. Highly recommended.**** out of ****\n",

      "Since this movie received so much critical acclaim I was nervous as to whether I would actually enjoy it. Man, it was awesome. Wonderfully refreshing, well-written (Charlie Kaufman is truly a storyteller) and heart warming. I loved the camera work/special effects used. The characters were easily identified with and the actors played them beautifully. I could feel their emotions, and Kate and Jim seemed like an every day, real couple. I would recommend this film to anyone, especially those who've had their heartbroken and wished they could erase bad memories. Great movie!! Three thumbs up! Yeah, I know we only have two but that's how good this movie is!!!\n",

      "I have not seen a film this well done in years. The camera angles and lighting are perfect. The script is fantastic. Jim Carey has now played his ultimate role. I can honestly say that he has pure talent, he has surpassed my expectations in this film. I always thought of him as silly (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Mask, Cable guy, etc...). Kate Winslet has played some amazing characters. Because I'm already biased, I say this is her best role yet. I love the storyline, it is pure and untouched in my opinion. I can't think of a film that is more original... trust me I tried. I won't go into long details on the film because it speaks for itself. This is a must-see!\n",

      "I saw the film twice now, and it moved me to tears both times. The big surprise for me was how a funny, smart idea (a company that erases memories, esp. of a relationship) turns out to be the basis of a gut-wrenching heartbreaker of a love story. The obvious quality of the movie is the brilliant script, which is why this is seen by many as the new Kaufman film. But that's only half the story. I think Michel Gondry has done an amazing job as well, in visualising very clearly some quite complex proceedings, with an understated humour, finding the perfect tone tosuit the script - i.e. not too funny, not too sentimental either.Another surprise is Jim Carrey, who plays a character that's totally different from anything he's done before and does it brilliantly. It's the best film I've seen since Lilja 4-ever, and though I loved Being John Malkovitch, I rate this one a bit higher even.\n",

We went expecting a really good film, because the writer of Eternal Sunshine is Charlie Kaufman who wrote other great movies like 'Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\". After the movie was done, My sister and I just looked at each other. We could tell by each other's expressions that we just saw more than a good movie. We saw, as my sister put it, \"A F*CKING GREAT MOVIE!\" Believe me when I say that it is unlike any other movie you will ever see. It's original, clever, funny, touching, and more very entertaining. It should be up for an Oscar this year. If they don't nominate this film, they are idiots. 10/10\n",

      "(Spoilers)This is the story of what happens when Clementine (Kate Winslet)decides to erase her ex-boyfriend, Joel (Jim Carrey) from hermemory. Because this is a story by Charlie Kaufman and not NoraEphron, Clem can literally do such a thing; when an aggrieved Joeldecides to reciprocate, we experience his memories of her just asthose memories are being destroyed.This is a marvelous film that could easily have coasted on itsamazing (and often funny) visual effects, but it succeeds becauseof Joel and Clementine. Carrey is touching in his portrayal of aslightly lost man -- I think this is his best dramatic role, perhapsbecause his character is sympathetic, but not heroic. Winslet'sperformance is less surprising -- Clementine, with her passionand desire for self-invention, shares something with Julia(Hideous Kinky) and Juliet (Heavenly Creatures,) but just as good.Their relationship is both charming and exasperating, andapparently they liked it that way: when Joel is talking (inside hishead) to his memory of Clementine, his brain makes her just asunpredictable as the real Clem. Their scenes together are sothoughtfully constructed that even though much of their story is toldin flashbacks, I still wondered exactly how it would turn out.Those with a rabid fear of sentiment won't like this movie, as it islargely a film about the nature of love, but this movie is definitelyworth seeing for its startling look and touching story.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\" is a searing roller-coaster of those unrelenting, cherished memories we would like to forget but still very much stay with us through life, about how certain memories cannot simply be erased from the mind because the mind sometimes works against our desires and preferences. The film enters us into a world of delirium, of resurfaced memories, and self-discovery, as we tour the world of a man who seeks to obliterate any memory of his \"love\" Clementine in undergoing a special surgery which allegedly erases unwanted memories. This sounds like a medial concept at the surface, leaving us to wonder how a single surgery can be absorbed into a two hour movie. Once we take a look inside the mind of an obviously confused yet experienced man, the story contorts itself into a brilliant, enjoyable roller-coaster of the man's identity: his relationships, events defining his existence, and certain revealing elements into Clementine's history as well. This is one wild (sometimes too zippy), fascinating, and relentless cerebral odyssey, taking us directly into the source of the mind, and how certain interference to its contents (this surgery in particular) can probably lead to a stampede of other memories in the way, which remind us of exactly why we are who we are. Definitely worth seeing, for its intellectual and cerebral value; a life inside the forever working mills of the mind. ***1/2 out of ****\n",

      "One of the most ambiguously advertised movies of the year (while touting a great cast), Eternal Sunshine does not disappoint in its plot, its acting, or namely, its originality. The plot focuses around a doctor that specializes in erasing one's mind of the painful memories that the erasee selects, such as a breakup (enter Carrey and Winslet). What a concept, huh?Brings the meaning of \"getting over someone\" to new levels! Without giving too much away, this movie has witty dialogue, interesting and dark characters, and a story line that will have you reeling for days afterwards.If you're a fan of movies that truly impact your mind, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.\n",

      "True art as I've never seen in a movie of this size. Absolutely wonderful. A must see for anyone who enjoys artistic quality above mere entertainment in a film, yet entertaining enough for those who don't appreciate the film's artistic value. Carrey is amazing in this film, not as a slap-stick comic as we have seen him in the past, but as a serious character within a true masterpiece. Winslett beautifully distinguishes between playing her character and the memory of her character. The effects perfectly add to the sense of confusion and frustration Joel feels in going through with the memory-erasing operation, yet these effects do not drown out the meaning of the film or the talent of the actors. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not the best altogether.\n",

      "When I was going to write a comment about this movie, I forgot my password. It was totally erased from my mind and then I thought, what a great thing to happened since I'm about to write something about this great, awesome and beautiful movie with an also beautiful a poetical name such as \"Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind\". But, then this could happened to anybody to forget and want to forget things of your past that have changed you in way you don't want to go on anymore. It's easy to forget small things and we usually mistake the good things and good memories of our life for small things. And only the bad things seem real important and occupy as much as we have in our brain's archive space.We where late for a movie that we were supposed to watch, instead we thought: \"what about this other movie...Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind\", then we got tickets for this strange movie we had no clue about. My brother got the tickets and also got all confuse because of the name and asked to the girl who was selling the tickets: \"give me 3 tickets for Sunshine of the eternal memory of the mind....well you know what I mean\"-he said- it was actually very funny.So we got there, we waited and the movie started. Charlie Kaufman was involved and I'm a big fan of him, so I said to myself: \"this is going to be a strange but very worthy ride...\" And it was, because the movie moved me, it took my feelings and it abused of them making me laugh, making me cry, having me so worried about everything, sometimes, so uncomfortable but yet so connected to this story. My mind went so far that I got to be part of Joel's memory, I don't know, but definitely he and clementine now are a part of mine. in a moment I thought this was happening to me. Before the end came I knew what was next, I was there...suffering along Clementine and Joel. I had flash backs from everything in my life and then it ended. I have to say I wanted to see even more but it was enough, again my dearest Charlie had done it: \"He stole my life, took my feelings and showed me the most radical but real of Human Nature\". And I thank him for that.Gondry and Kaufman are as genius as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak and his revolutionary invention: \"the bad memories erasure\". But just now, after watching the movie I think I would never follow such a procedure. Memories are life given. Because they change us, they create what we are in this illusionary present.During the movie I got to love Clementine (Kate Winslet), the memories Joel had about her, the good things he had in his mind about this special girl were so pretty that could inspire any troubled couple to work things out. I must say that Kate Winslet it's a stunning actress and for this movie she was just perfect and Jim Carrey it's not only a comedian, oh no, he is also and mainly an amazing actor.\n",

      "-SPOILERS-This is a brilliant movie. The uniqueness of the plot surpasses even Being John Malkovich, which was my favourite movie before this. Everything falls into place: writing, editing, casting, music. The only thing that disturbed me was the ending, because I felt it was resolved a little too quickly. However, this is possibly the best stuff I've ever seen from Kaufman, and great work from Winslet and Carrey. There are many different ways of making a movie like this(I could imagine the writers trying different strategies before coming up with this one). The timeline is very important. The true brilliance of the movie is in the time sequence. It can be very confusing at first, but it's also very intriguing.There are many scenes where you are led to expect a more chronological narrative. In the beginning of the movie, when Joel and Clementine meet, you are fooled to thinking it's the first time they meet. Cue the opening credits and their breakup. When Joel is at the doctor's office, he starts talking about the first time they met; we see a film rolling, showing the party where it happened. You might expect to see their whole relationship in flashbacks with Joel as the narrator, but the flashback is cut off and we're back in the story. What you then see is their whole relationship in flashbacks, but in a REVERSED order, with Joel being aware of the procedure and trying to change the chain of events. He isn't narrating old events to the viewers, he is reliving them and trying to hold on to the memories as they are disappearing before his eyes. The result is a breath-taking chase through Joel's subconscious - somewhat similar to the one in Being John Malkovich, but more deep. At the same time, we see the \"erasers\" working at Joel's apartment and their relationship with each other, which also becomes somewhat surprising. The movie deals with a lot of deep issues. For example, how love turns into hate; how the memory works; how you have to erase a person from your life totally when you break up, and a big part of yourself too. In the end, Joel and Clementine decide to fall in love all over again, despite the problems they had. It can be seen as a statement: even if love isn't easy, it's always worth living. 10/10.\n",

      "This is a subtle and intimate lovestory, Carrey and Winslet play the odd-couple very convincingly. Carrey plays Joel, timid and a bit of a shut-in, Winslet's character Celementine is impulsive and outgoing. The relationship goes sour, and Joel goes to a company that erases all his memories of Celementine. Large part of the movie plays inside Joel's head as his memories of his girlfriend are erased. Special effects are used sparingly but effective. Joel forgetting things is represented by words disappearing from books, colours fading, or simply by gradually turning off the lights in a room.The genre notation \"comedy\" might give some people the wrong expectations, as this is not a typical Jim Carrey comedy movie. But don't let that stop you from seeing it, because so far, this is the best movie this year. Forget comicbook hero's, planet-sized explosions and $10.000.000 worth of CGI, this movie is the complete opposite. In fact, the bizarre script, the simple way of filming, the acting etc. make this movie a one-of-a-kind. Which is a shame i guess, because there should be more movies as good as this one.So far, the best movie this year. Highly recommended.\n",

      "Although I've heard from several people that this movie isn't good just before I saw it, I went to see it any way and I was in for a surprise. This is definitely the best movie I've seen in years, and I'll explain why:1. Script, script and once more: script - Charlie Kaufman proves himself as being one of the most original script writers in Hollywood. Besides originality (which is like a cool breeze in the \"summer of hot movies\"), Kaufman shows great sensibility to one's mind and inner thoughts. With what seems to be a magical wand, he manages to illustrate very vividly and accurately what's on a man's mind, including feelings of shame, lust, depression and day-by-day relationships' love.2. Acting - It comes as no surprise to me that Jim Carrey is a very gifted and versatile actor, yet in this film he shows skills I didn't know where there. Somehow he manages to look like a completely different person, and it's not the makeup. Even Kate Winslet, which I usually dislike, acts marvelously. 3. Editorial decisions - If you're looking for good examples of how to edit brilliantly, this is the place. Finally I see computer effects that are subtle enough, much of the movie is quite hectic (especially with locations) and the editor shows great skill of combining all of these so different scenes together.4. Casting - Jim Carrey wouldn't have been my first choice for the lead role, but he proved me wrong, didn't he? Kate Winslet seems to be the greatest casting choice in a decade and Elijah Wood is very surprising as Patrick, a refreshing role after the Frodo era. What about Dunst? Well, she's charming, and that's a surprise as well, as we all remember her in Bad Beautiful and Spiderman.5. Like \"Adaptation\", this movie is especially interesting for film makers or just film lovers. You have it all here - A good storyline written amazingly as a script that is combined elegantly with means of editing, sound and acting. Altogether I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10, which is a lot.6. Some drawbacks though - The movie is very disorienting, so be prepared to be confused. This is also why you should try to stay sober for this one, as it's a clever and complex film. Another thing that bothered me was the ending, but since I don't want to spoil it, let's just say it was somewhat a disappointment.7. Go see this movie if you want to see a well done drama with slight comic pauses.\n",

      "I have seen many movies I thought I loved, but nothing has quite touched me like this film did. The film grabs you on many levels - it occasionally makes you laugh, certainly makes you think (a refreshing change in view of usual Hollywood fare) and unless you have a heart of stone, is likely to make you want to cry as well. The bitter/sweet ending is a true choker - my throat ached with pent-up emotion (I refuse to cry in cinemas!).The script is wonderful, imaginative and joyously original. Kaufmann must surely nab the 2005 Oscar for this fine feat. The direction was slick and yet subtle when required, coping admirably with a convoluted plot and fractured, non-linear narrative style.The acting was admirable, although with such marvelous material to work with it would have been a giant effort in itself to screw up too much here. Dunst and Rufalo were engaging in the film's key subplot, but the film truly belongs to Carrey and Winslet as the lovers who are at pains to forget each other though at such great pain to themselves. (SPOILER) The denouement when they agree to try again, even though they are confused, in turmoil, but needing each other so desperately, even with the uncertain knowledge that their love is probably doomed, and doomed to be doomed again and again, is truly wonderful, achingly beautiful and acted with such vivid emotion - Winslet is especially impressive.This film deserves academy awards, so hopefully it will be re-released nearer nomination time. It is countless times better than most of the dross which passes for reasonable viewing these days. It stays with you, keeps you thinking, challenges and inspires.\n",

It was a complete disappointment; and my friends and I were prepared to leave, but waited and waited for it to get better...and it only got worse. The plot seemed interesting enough, but it proved to be a very strange movie. It seems that Jim Carrie is completely commercialized, just churning out movies, however ridiculous they may be. In the past, I would discard movies below a rating of 6, surely go to watch the sevens, and definitely not miss eights or more.

      "I put off watching this movie for a long time... never really seemed like something I'd be interested in. A few weeks ago I downloaded the movie, burned it last night and threw it in my player to check the results. Needless to say, after hitting play, I never hit stop...Going into this movie, I had no expectations -- not even a clue as to what the movie was about. From what I remembered, the commercials made it seem like Jim Carrey's character got brain damage and forgot everything, only to see the world in a new light. Turns out the movie is nothing like that at all. I can describe the \"Eternal Sunshine\" experience in one phrase: painfully magical. For anyone that has ever been in a relationship with someone that truly meant something to them, I have to believe it would affect them in a similar way. At the same time, one with no experience in such matters may walk away from the movie thinking \"what was the point of that?\" Therein lies the reason why this picture is not in the top 20 of all-time.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet put in perfect performances as the main characters. Dialogue is well-scripted and beautifully delivered. Funny moments are intertwined with underlying notions of love, fear, and happiness to create situations where you don't know whether to laugh or cry -- or both. You walk away from the movie reevaluating experiences in your own life... wondering what memories you'd really sacrifice -- and whether anything is so bad that you'd give it all up. Clementine: I wish you'd stayed.Joel: I wish I'd stayed, too. NOW I wish I'd stayed. I wish I'd done a lot of things. I wish I'd... I wish I'd stayed... I do.10 / 10 -- I'm off to buy it tonight, and watch it again.\n",

      "Overall this movie exceeded my expectations. I normally don't care much for either Jim Carrey or Kate Winslett, and was expecting typical performances from them. I'm quite pleased that I was wrong. At no point in the movie did I feel that I was watching Carrey and Winslett, but rather watching a unique movie with a lot of soul that was built artfully around a fascinating central concept. The only thing that detracted from the experience was that I knew too much about the movie beforehand. I guess that my dislike for the actors combined with the glowing reviews and recommendations made me research the movie pretty carefully before watching it. I wish I had seen the movie knowing nothing about it. The experience would have been much greater.Overall: 9/10Additional note: I watched this movie during a trans-Atlantic flight from Detroit to Amsterdam. That may have enhanced the somewhat dream-like quality of the movie for me.\n",
      "1431\n",
      "The first ten minutes of this film are it's strongest. There is a gentle unease all the way through to the opening credits and Jim Carrey does well to convey this mood in his character. The feeling of falling head over heels in love, is wonderfully juxtaposed with the thought that things are not quite as they may appear.After that, however, the movie goes mostly downhill, degenerating to a \"we're in love, no we're not, yes we are, oh I don't know\" situation. A lot of this has to do with the movie playing it's hand too soon and thereby losing much of the real mystery that it had gained in the beginning. Seemingly endless, chaotic dream sequences do not really do much to explore the relationship between the two main characters in depth.Still, better than most movies.\n",

      "This is definitely the best film I have seen so far this year. It was the most original, heartfelt, brilliant, twisted love story I have seen in a long time. And did I mention that it is also quite funny. This story comes from the brilliant mind of writer Charlie Kaufman. When I heard it was directed by Michel Gondry I was a little worried, Kaufman and Gondry had last teamed up on the interesting but ultimately irritating Human Nature. But Gondry lives up to the promise he showed with his original video work for Bjork, The White Stripes etc... He shows an uncanny knack for creating images that are beautiful and that conjure up emotions and feelings that one cannot put into words. The story involves a lonely man named Joel Parrish (Jim Carrey) who meets a wild free spirit named Clementine(Kate Winslet). They embark on a wild romance that goes sour. When Joel discovers that Clementine has had him removed from her memory by a revolutionary scientist(Tom Wilkinson) he decides to do the same. The people who work for Wilkinson and perform the procedure on Joel are played by Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kirsten Dunst. Each member of the supporting cast delivers performances that cut deeper than one might expect(special kudos to Ruffalo and Dunst who find the bruised heart of their romance and make it more than just a diversionnary subplot. Now once the procedure begins Joel begins to realize he doesn't want the procedure done. And his realization that he is losing all memory of the one he loves is what makes this film the best of the year. Carrey and Winslet are truly phenomenal in the leads. Carrey shows a depth that he has not shown since Man on the Moon. He is truly up to the challenge that the script is placing on him. And Winslet, well is there anything this woman can't do. She is hilarious, and heartbreaking and everything in between. If my plot synopsis wasn't very good it is because i feel you have to experience this movie, you can't describe it, but aren't all of the best ones like that.\n",

      "This is the second movie that I went to see many times.1- The idea is simple yet was uniquely handled. If you are dumped, is it easy for you to lose your love?2- The movie is like a huge, dark painting with many, yet simple, details.3- Could be the first real dramatic role for Jim Carrey (the crown). The scene where he opens his eyes but can not talk, while in operation, then tears come out of his eye is very touchy.4- Although you can not find this in many romantic movies, the end is cheerful! 5- Visual effects are very simple and they fit. They fit so you think they are simple!I strongly recommend it.\n",

In the tide of Hollywood genre movies that are focused on making money, it is refreshing to see a film that is original and has some artistic integrity and intelligence behind the plot. Movies like Eternal Sunshine and American Beauty which question the nature and beauty of modern life and love. I was also very impressed by Carey's performance.

      "This is by far the best thinker-movie I've seen this year.  Finally, it took Charlie Kaufman to re-invent both the romantic comedy and the mind-erasure scifi thriller.  Now you can look at Total Recall and think it's cliched. We could already do that with every single Julia Roberts movie, however.In just two movies, I was already a fan of Charlie Kaufman, dying to know what he'll come up with next.  If the first two were the hook and line, this one's the sinker.  I get a third film that's on par or better than the previous two. (I haven't seen Human Nature).Charlie Kaufman is going to be a name that you hear in phrases in the future.  This I predict.  You know how people say things like \"Well, I'm no Einstein, but...\" when it comes to intellect.  When it comes to writing, people will probably say, \"Well, it's not Charlie Kaufman, but...\".  Maybe he won't replace Shakespeare, but he'll at least cut into his profit margin.A rare 10/10\n",

      "A question haunted me for the last five years or so: What is the value of the memory of a single instant? What is the value of all? What I would lose if I did not have the memory of this single instant? Do we live in vain, just to have some faint remembrances of the past? Even if we live our day to its maximum possibility- it somehow ends. Leaving us with a list of memories, most would be forgotten in a week anyway.Film walks around the subject gracefully. You happen to see all the memory instances, their respective values, and their total value. Very impressive.Also one of the best told love stories ever. Story itself is not original at all, an ordinary love. But the telling is. Highly recommended if you are into minds, relationships or your own life -how you happen to live it-\n",

      "Once again Charlie Kaufman puts out a brilliant screenplay that speaks to the human plight on every level of it's existence. This movie is essentially for couples what Adaptation was for lonely souls. Jim Carrey turns in a performance as unexpected as anything I've seen in film. Even his other respected acting acredits still harbor an essence of Ace Ventura/Mask etc etc..... here it's gone completely and the character on screen is not Jim Carrey, it's Joel. Which is to say nothing of Kate Winslet who can not be forgiven for the first two hours of Titanic.All the subtle nuances of that messy affair known as love or romance is brought to full bare in this arthouse take on Total Recall's premise. I've tried to get all my married friends to watch this so that they might learn to appreciate their spouses a little more, but to no avail. The writing lacks somewhat the irony and cynicism that are present in other Kaufman works (especially Human Nature) but here it works to the movies advantage as Carrey plums the mines of of his own psychosis in order to have the choice as to whether he will one day be able to savor the bittersweet essence of giving one's own self up for the noble pursuit of happiness.\n",

This movie is currently ranked #38 on the IMDb's top 100 movies of all time, and I can see why! To be inside the mind and dreams of Jim Carrey was a real trip. The camera work, imagery, effects, and cinematography were all top-notch. Kate Winslet gave an Oscar- worthy performance as well. The concept and story were just brilliant.

This time, unlike Malkovic or Adaptation, it wasn't what the dialogs were there to serve. Oh no. In Eternal Sunshine the whole erase-your-memories-to-get-over-your-ex thing is merely there to say stuff that matters, or at least, mattered to me, about how we fall in and out of love and what in the world we should do about it.

      "Eternal Sunshine... deals with big themes using interesting structures, but falls short of its potential due to unnecessary flaws.  The film is based around the separate decisions of two lovers to have the memories of each other erased (the main character, played by Carrey, does so only on discovering that the Winslet character has already done so).  The memory removal process involves replaying memories of the other party before erasure.  The majority of the movie takes place in Carrey's mind as memories are triggered and he changes his mind and tries to find a way of holding onto at least some of the memories.In the meantime, we see the agenda of the memory erasure company being played out around him as he sleeps and has his memory removed (for example one of the workers has been using his journal as a tool for courting the Winslet character).SPOILER WARNINGThese private agendas eventually lead to the memory erasure people's processes being sabotaged.  In the meantime, the two leads have found a way of getting back together, although they do not remember the first time around.  They receive records showing that they have previously separated and erased each other but decide that it is better to love and lose than not to love at all.END SPOILERAlthough this is a basically highly romantic film in conception, the delivery is anything but romantic.  Particularly grating for this reviewer was the very high level of offensive language.  The cinematography and editing were also jarring at times.I appreciated the serious efforts that the writer and director had taken to challenge their viewers, but felt that, in the end, the film fell a little short of the mark.\n",

What person wouldn't want to fight to not forget Winslet as Clementine?  She may have a cyclonic temper, but she's a sweet and vibrant personality.  She imprints herself on Carrey's Joel Barish so much that his own memory of her becomes a heroine to his invaded mind.As for Jim Carrey, his own range of emotion, from rage to confusion to utter joy and contentment, adds a deft subtlety to a movie about great extremes. Such an impressive performance makes me want to go to the doctor to erase any preconceived notion about him.Kaufman continues to point a frightened finger at those who take their lives like a grain of salt, easy to be thrown away or pulled like a bad tooth. Here, not as in \"...Malkovich,\" is a message \"eternally spotless:\"  Our memories and fantasies are what makes us human.  No matter how painful they are, we should never throw them away.\n",

      "\"If I had to live my life again, I'd make the same mistakes, only sooner.\" - Tallulah BankheadWhy do I love \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?\" Because it's refreshingly unique, funny and the most inventive love story made in a very long time.Charlie Kaufman proves once more he's quite possibly the most original screenwriter working today. \"Being John Malkovich\" was ingenious, and even Kaufman's lesser work - the first two-thirds of \"Adaptation\" had some of the best writing in recent memory, but the film fell apart in a ridiculous third act - is better than much of what Hollywood churns out regularly.Buoyed by two fine performances by Jim Carrey as Joel Barrish and (an outstanding) Kate Winslet as Clementine, and Ellen Kuras' vibrant cinematography, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" dares its viewers to ponder hard about the story and to try and work out the plot in their minds. Kaufman eschews the genre's clich√©s and conventional plot points, which often are albatrosses around writers of romantic-comedies and -dramas.Despite a mind-boggling narrative and dizzying visuals, Kaufman and director Michel Gondry make us care about Joel and Clementine. Which is more than can be said of many conventional romantic films these days. Kaufman's story disorients us, but does make sense. It might seem as if Joel and Clementine are simply meeting endlessly but, as the story unfolds, what you thought was senseless becomes perfectly clear. The film seems to insist we're bound to repeat the same mistakes when it comes to love and relationships. And given the emotional trauma we often endure in love, who wouldn't want to erase sour memories? But erasure also excises all the good stuff, which often is what makes the bad stuff so tolerable anyway.Carrey's an ideal Joel. He brings the right amount of whimsy and confusion to the part. It's a sensationally good breakaway from Carrey's slapstick work. Winslet captivates us as Clementine. Her quirkiness, coupled with an intense lovability, makes her utterly enchanting. And superb supporting turns by Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood help enormously, too.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" could only have come from the mind of Kaufman. Despite its unconventional approach, the film makes a very basic point: that it's natural for human beings to have a tremendous capacity and desire for romance, love and relationships, no matter the pitfalls. And so, as Joel might say, all we can do is, \"Enjoy it.\"\n",

      "Another (literal) trip into the human psyche, ESOTSM is a romantic drama/comedy that feels like a close companion to Being John Malkovich. Basically a love story with a twist (mind erasing) manages to score despite a plot-wise light script, but with a visually arresting style, and some wonderful performances.Gondry's directing gives the film a claustrophobic, angst-ridden look that together with the sterile settings, perfectly capture Carrey's feelings after being dumped by girlfriend Winslet. The film looks very low budget, but during the journey through Carrey's mind, Gondry employs some impressive, bizarre effects.Like You Can Count On Me (another film I can heartily recommend) Spotless relies heavily on great acting in depicting everyday life. Carrey does what he does best and skips his manic spasms in favour of a very low key performance as loser Joel. Winslet's Clementine, on the other hand, is a frantic, energetic girl, that's not always easy to like, but Winslet is simply stunning in the role, and pulls of another great performance. The rest of the cast is equally good and proves that you can come a long way with real actors.Overall, the film should appeal to those who liked Kaufman's previous efforts, and who are in the mood for a nice story about a love affair that's not necessarily always straight forward.\n",

      "I'll be very brief. Eternal sunshine is the way all romantic interest based films (I hate the term rom-com) should be. Quirky, hilarious, touching and genuine, it scores on every front. Visual effects are brilliant and used for the right reasons- not just weak eye candy. Kaufmann deserves his celebrity, and Eternal Sunshine scores on all fronts. One of the most wonderful films ever made- all who have loved and lost will appreciate this movieOne to see ASAP\n",

      "There are plenty of good write-ups about the details of this movie so I'll skip the plot details. I love movies, and this has quickly become my favorite of all time. It bumps Fight Club, Amadeus, Pulp Fiction, and Snatch down a notch and clearly stands out as the best for me.Few people think outside the box, something I truly love to do. Often when I watch a movie that I enjoy, I find myself asking, \"Could I have created that?\" I enjoyed Top Gun, but I feel anyone could have come up with the storyline. The same for Aliens, another of my favorites... great movie, but I could have come up with that idea, EASILY.Fight Club and Pulp Fiction are a little different. I don't know that on my own I would have come up with those techniques. Mememto is another interesting technique. But these shows are still linearly written and then shaken up. A neat technique, but just one step off the normal beaten path.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is many steps off of that path. It is one of the very few movies where I left thinking, \"I don't know if I could have come up with that idea if you gave me a lifetime.\" I was jealous that someone had created something so very creative and that I doubted I could have thought of myself. THAT is MY kind of movie!If you're the type that needs to be lead by the nose through a plot (a la Braveheart), then this movie is NOT for you. If you hate to really think during a movie (like with Memento), then forget it. But if you want to be stimulated by one of the most innovative works put on film, watch this movie.By the way, I am definitely NOT a Jim Carrey or Kate Winslet fan, but they were superb. This has definitely turned my opinion of Carrey as an actor, and I am now convinced he is more than a rubber face and a goofy actor. (He's come a long, LONG way from In Living Color and Mask.) I have to credit Winslet, who I have eternally associated with the sappy, predictable, snoozer Titanic. A totally unusual character, but played very well by her.I would only recommend this movie to someone looking to be stimulated by something completely different. If you're not the type to look past the violence in Fight Club, or the type that doesn't have the RAM to watch the reverse chronology of Memento, then forget watching this movie. If you truly savor stimulating, thought-provoking material, you have found one of the best.\n",

      "I only want to comment on the movie by saying it was a pure delight. Barring no surprises this fall, I strongly expect this movie to not only be nominated for Best Picture, but actually have a chance at winning it. By far Carrey and Winslet's finest acting. A real treat. The basic synopsis for the movie is Winslet in a fit of rage over her relationship with Carrey decides to seek out a \"memory wipe\" over the whole ordeal. Carrey, feeling sad and betrayed, seeks out the same procedure. The big problem is this: All memories of the loved one are wiped out including the good stuff. Carrey realizes this only too late and in a last ditch effort, tries to manipulate the procedure while within his own mind. This leads to all kinds of nifty tricks, stunning visuals, and great plot twists. The movie's end is nifty and doesn't ring false. The screenplay is terrific. Don't miss this movie!\n",

      "OK i just finished this movie and the first thing that comes to my mind of writing a review of this movie is, i have never seen something like this before, this is something completely different and it works. I heard a lot about this movie before i watched it and i was afraid that it was a bit hyped and might be disappointing because i was expecting to much but it was even better than i suspected although the majority might think otherwise cause its not your typical Hollywood vin diesel crap, which unfortunately most people still like cause its simple to watch and you don't have to think that much. but this one is a real mind breaker even for me and i don't want to say I'm that smart or something but i watched a lot of mind breaking movies like David lynch's movies and 2001 a space oddesy and more stuff like that.I loved this movie the only thing about the movie that was a bit disappointing is the too clear ending, after the movie is over you understand the whole story, so it doesn't keep you thinking afterwards like the movies from lynch and stuff. the only thing it does keep you thinking about is the fact, what if this is possible in the future should we do so or not but i think the story also covered that answer but everyone keeps his own opinion on that never the less i enjoyed it and i give a 9/10\n",

      "This inspired inquiry into dreams and memory‚Äîsuffused, like \"Waking Life,\" with certain metaphysical questions: Can we exert control over our dreams? Can our waking actions be affected?‚Äîis proficiently anchored by both Gondry's visualization of memories being ripped from the protean grasp of desire and the heart-rending account of an afflicted couple trying to outwit their own self-destructive impulses. It seems that after his ambitious but not quite satisfying attempt to climb inside the artist's head during creative constipation and compromise (Adaptation), Charlie Kaufman has found a director who can not only evoke his flighty genius in image, but who can reign in and expand his ideas. And it is a rare film that can so skillfully say opposing things about the nature of relationships: They end in suffering and misery between hopelessly incongruous people, but they still require careful consideration and a selfsame willingness to suffer despite the stacked odds. Hell of a conundrum.\n",

      "spoilers. ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is Carrey's latest movie and to tell you the truth; it's probably the best his ever made. The movie is neither pure comedy or pure drama, it's a sort of THE TRUMAN SHOW in twist between those two genres. Carrey does a very good performance in the leading role, and together with more great actors like Tom Wilkinson, Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst this movie is truly one of the biggest highlights per today in 2004. Joel and Clementine is a odd couple that's easily going threw bad and good times. But then, Clementine is suddenly gone and when Joel meets her again she pretends that she doesn't know him. Joel being in a confusing situation tells this to his parents, and then he gets to know that some doctors has erased her memory of him. This confusing him even more, he decides to check it out. Joel decides himself to erase Clementine from his memory, but, under the procedure Joel suddenly decides to stop the whol erasing. He starts running away from the memory-eraser, with Clementine beside her...The movie is confusing, fascinating, interesting, charming and wonderfully made. Jim Carrey that's always been the big-joker with funny faces and stuff, simply delivers a fine character performance here of a man that really doesn't want to loose his girlfriend. Dunst, as always a charming girl that truly is one of the big female talents inside Hollywood. ETERNAL SUNSHINE is very complicated in its way, and the movie is so extremely charming and fine made that I sat smiling threw it's runtime. It's not the everyday movie and I really enjoyed watching it, because it was so freaking different! The charming part of it lays like a blancet over the romance, soundtrack and directing part. The laughs lays in Carrey's brilliance as usual, being a born-to-do-comedy actor. I really recommend this, being one of the most peculiar and charming movies in a long, long time.STARS: 4-5/5\n",

      "... Michel Gondry is a genius, and to be fair, so is Charlie Kaufman, but the actual sight of losing someone resonated with me... The visuals were amazing without being overpowering... I've followed Gondry's work for a while, and no one could have been more thrilled to hear of his involvement with this film. The movie was so brilliant just because it could have been horrible with anyone less capable at the helm. Everyone involved with this movie seemed to be operating at career best. ... This movie came out just after I lost a family member special to me, and for how horrible losing them was, I'd do it all over again, would never trade our time together even knowing that our ending wouldn't be of best friends riding off into the sunset. I still want to run off into the beach, even if it is on a cloudy day.\n",

      "Just when you think that movie makers have finally run out of ideas, between all lame thrillers, ridiculous action movies and vomit-inducing romantic comedies, something as fresh, original, and pure as \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" comes across. Thank you!I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Charlie Kaufman's other work (\"Being John Malkovich\" was not interesting or funny, just weird) but here he has really outdone himself, as has the rest of the people involved in the movie. Jim Carrey once again shows that he can really act (as he did before in \"The Truman Show\"), Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst prove that they can do more than be the \"damsel in distress\" and even Elijah Wood seem to be able to distance himself from Frodo. The real winner here is the script though. It succesfully avoids all the cliches and false sentiments that often plague modern movies and manages to deliver a truly touching story about real people and real emotions, while also being surprisingly funny at times. Also, in spite of the rather bizarre premise, the movie never comes across as too far-fetched or unbelievable. \n",
      "What else is there to like? Well, a lot. The cinematography is beautiful (the scenes in which Joel's memories are erased are very creative), the movie plays around with illusion and reality in a really interesting way (it's left to the viewer to figure out what exactly is going on. This never gets as complicated as in, say, \"Mulholland Drive\", but I like movies that don't spell everything out for you). The only complaint I have about \"Sunshine\" is that is seems to slightly run out of steam near the end. It's like the writers couldn't choose between a happy or a sad ending and delayed the choice as long as possible. Ultimately, I can more than live with the ending they choose, but they could have chosen it a bit sooner.But that's a really minor complaint. Apart from that, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is an incredibly well-made, very creative, and genuinely touching movie. Highly recommended.\n",
      "1456\n",
      "There's some beautifully affecting and underplayed romance in \"Eternal Sunshine\" that at times is so poignant and realistic in its approach it feels a wonderfully fresh antidote to the sanitized gloss that Hollywood usually turns out.  A romantic movie for those who dislike 'conventional' romantic movies, then?Well, no.  Oftentimes the simplest moments are the most touching ones, and everybody here is so concerned with convoluting the journey at times that the real moments of empathy sometimes wind up getting lost.  It's a shame that an idea so full of possibility just goes nuts with that very quality, adding more complex elements that aren't needed, primarily to appease a more 'highbrow' audience.  I found Kauffman's earlier film \"Being John Malkovitch\" suffered from much the same problem as far as I was concerned; an ingenious central concept, the effect of which emerged diluted because of far too much unnecessary 'weirdness'.  A case of Kauffman and co. gilding the lily, if you will, which unfortunately is in evidence again here.\"Eternal Sunshine\" hit a bullseye when it just concentrated solely on exploring the pain of loss.  Despairingly, though, it almost turned into a bad quasi-thriller with the advent of stuff about Joel and Clementine preserving old memories by artificially recreating new ones, and other such wandering into artificial realities.  I understood the musing that after the erasure process complications may arise from people still being inexorably drawn to each other without remembering why; ponder this, though: Did such a large portion of the movie REALLY need to be hijacked by such extraneous detail taking up space?  The net result of such a course as far as I could see was the emotional 'heart' of the movie nearly being allowed to wither away.  This is a more lamented loss than in the case of \"Being John Malkovitch\", purely because there's MORE of it in this instance!  The 'nuts and bolts' that once held Clementine and Joel's relationship together are pitifully neglected, on occasion.The positive moments for me, though, are the ones borne of 'tenderness'. The film manages the unique trick of being at once achingly personal at times, yet oddly universal, as well.  Memories are those which are private to us, but we have the facility to share them with others, too.  It's the completely charming cinematic couple of Clementine and Joel that made me root for love as an 'ideal' and always want to keep watching.  In particular, I'm now convinced that it would be a betrayal of Carrey's talents if he were to return to the arena of slapstick comedy without such strong central stories underpinning him.  Now, all he (and Kauffman ESPECIALLY!) need to do is find a balance and stay on the right side of 'idiosyncratic', because \"Sunshine\" sees them veering away on unnecessary tangents far too often for my liking.

      "How can I possibly sum up my feelings on this film in less than a thousand words? I was simply overwhelmed and beside myself while watching this film. It is without a doubt the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. All of the emotion of it was simply incredible. It made me realize how much there is to us and the ones we love with all of our heart- the pain we put one another through and yet- we could never live without them. Jim Carreys' performance was outstanding- it was as if I could feel his pain. This film comes highly recommended and I hope that everyone takes from it what I did- that the main characters are all of us- that we all suffer in love- yet it is how we remind ourselves of why we're together that keeps us moving forward.\n",

I found myself entirely lost in it's plot twists as if I myself has been caught in all the drama.I loved it.This movie made me realize, remembering something bad in the past, having memories, and generally being human, gives me life.Having no memories of something that made me laugh and cry, can be the most heartbreaking thing, I supposed.Jim Carrey puts on a deeply enticing performance as Joel, he once more convinced me, that he is no longer the wacky Ace Ventura (I cannot picture anybody else as him anyway), but an actor who has captured my attention since The Truman Show (another of my favorite movie).Kate Winslet, in her most outstanding work to date (apart from the exposure of Titanic), carries off Clementine's outrageous hair and disposition as if she was Clementine herself.Alright, rambling aside - this movie rawks my socks off.\n",

      "Stories of love. Yeah, you can see many of them in the movies, in the playhouses, anywhere. But REAL stories of love and passion... It's a different point. In \"Eternal Sunshine\" the love is expressed as a powerful; unique thing. Real romances can't be erased. Kaufman shows that in an 'eccentric',modern and keen way. A way that will be eternally in your mind, probably. Jim Carrey's and Kate Winslet's talent, of course, it's a fundamental thing for the process of the movie. The freaky Clementine and the shy Joel are really brilliant characters. Michael Gondry's ability is also a good point for this masterpiece. You can go to the theater without any fear, but it's something that can change your life. By the way, rounds and rounds of applause for the best film of the year.\n",
      "1460\n",
      "\"Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind\" is definitely, in my opinion, one of the best script by Charlie Kaufman and the movie itself delivers too, in almost every aspect, being cinematography, directing or acting.What strikes me first is the cinematography. The whole movie looks like an independent movie shot with hand-held camera off the street and that ppl who made this didn't bother with too much editing afterwards either. But the washed-out sunshine and blank winter scenes gave the story a consistent feeling of void, emptiness. It successfully delivered a subdued, hushed sentiment without being unnecessarily depressing. Not to mention the metaphorical scenes of the disappearance of memories: the confused face fading into darkness, to be lost forever; the collapse of the beach house like a sand house washed by the current of time; the erase of ppl one by one which reduced the crowded central station into a ghost house and deserted land...they are just all beautifully and artfully done.Another funky side of this movie is how the premise is set up. The ability of selectively erasing memories from a person's mind is down-right sci-fi, but that's as high-tech as it gets. The private clinics that performs this uncanny operation is run by a lackluster doctor in his late 50s who looks more like a miserable salesman who forgot suicide as an option than a cutting-edged scientist. And his staff members are a bunch of wackos and mishaps that seem inevitably flunked out of high school. And that¬°¬Øs the beauty of it. The whole thing is based on a joke, but u just can't help wanting to believe and feel sad about it. In a certain sense, it reminds me of Metamorphosis. Reflection on memories is an eternal subject of human literacy. There's of course Proust with ¬°¬∞A la recherche du temps perdu.¬°¬±, the Memoir of All Time, and Virginia Woolf¬°¬Øs ¬°¬∞Mrs. Dalloway¬°¬±, where Clarissa went about her day in mundane business while mentally traveled through her whole life and re-affirm her of her status in society and philosophy in life. Same with Peter Walsh, the ultimate outcast, returning to London brought back his memories of the youth, intertwining with Calrissa's, and also re-affirmed his disdain of the upper class and justified his exile. On a smaller and simpler scale, the movie touched the same subject. It said nothing more than It's our memories that made us who we are.¬°¬±, a clich¬®¬¶ indeed, but it was said in a convincing and witty way. In the middle of the process, Joel (Jim Carry) realized his memories of Clementine (Kate Winslet) are too precious to sacrifice for the ease of the pain, so together they try to escape from the relentless pursue of the erasing process. The movie took a dangerous turn here, risking in sliding into the clich¬®¬¶ of another Hollywood romantic movie, but this time Kaufman handled it gracefully. (Unlike ¬°¬∞Adaptation¬°¬±, which has a glorious first 20 mins then faded into irrelevance shortly after) In spite of their heroic and persistent efforts, the memories were finally totally erased, a metaphor of the futile struggle of retaining humanity in an age of machinery. But the triumphant statement had been made, so humanity did finally prevail. In a reincarnation sort of way. This is the cynical part of the movie, the display of the hopeless habit of human being to fall for the same emotional pattern over and over again, in spite of their constant efforts to jump out the circle and achieve the sweet nirvana of nonchalance. The affair between the secretary and the doctor is a clever subplot that addressed the same issue. The secretary fell for the doctor again, knowing he has a family, after erasing her memories of having affair with him. Quick wit? Yes. But it serves a convincing conter part of Joel and Clementine, who woke up in the process and faced their oblivion. Just like Septimus Smith serves as a counter part to Mrs. Dalloway but ultimately perished. It's fair to say that both Jim Carey and Kate Winslet broke new ground with their convincing acting in this movie. For Jim Carey, he followed a familiar pattern of establishing oneself as a serious actor after being commercially successful, like Adam Saddler did in Punch Drunk Love and recently Charlie Thorton in Monster. Admittedly, acting as an introvert, low-down, just-another-guy is not a far cry from his other roles (Dumb and Dumber and even Mask), but he deliver it ever-more gracefully in this movie. He's also very convincing in interpreting the passive-aggressive personality of Joel, and how Joel projected his insecurity onto Clementine when he accused her of being indiscriminating in sleeping with guys to get affection. Cause it's so difficult for him to gain intimacy with other people it frustrated him seeing how Clementine could do it effortless thus not cherished it as much as he did. But Kate Winslet's acting surely surpassed any other actors in this movie, when she looked at Joel apologetically and said, You know me, I'm impulsive It¬°¬Øs a perfect footnote to why a guy like Joel would hopelessly fall in love with her. The scene of the night at the deserted beach house is very moving, it also elaborated the point that one should face their demon inside, instead of banishing it into a remote corner. Joel never felt comfortable in their relationship, and the beach house again served as a metaphor, where all Clementine was doing is enjoying the moment, while he was always an outsider and constantly looking for an excuse to leave. Anyway, this movie has the potential to instantly make my top-5 date movie list, speaking of which, here's a tentative list :) :5. High fidelity 4.Beautiful girls 3.Eternal sunshine of Spotless Mind 2.Natural Born Killer (I throw this in just for the heck of it :)1.Wings of desire Come to think of it, it's more like a list of top 5 movie to watch after the breakup.\n",

Jim Carrey was amazing, and the fact that Kate Winslet just happens to be in this film makes it a hundred times better. Not only is she an excellent actress, she's also the most beautiful woman on the planet. It's nice to see a gorgeous actress who can also act.

If you are in love or have ever been in love, this film is for you. I won't go over the plot, because there's no reason to. However, I must say that the performances (ALL OF THEM) are wonderfully subtle. They aren't subtle like Lost In Translation, they're just real. Jim Carrey is heartbreaking and deserves an Oscar for his performance. This is his first time since The Truman Show that a director has taken him and given him material that shows off his talent. Kate Winslet is also tremendous... pulling off the perfect eccentric, bitchy, outgoing girl. Got to love Mark Ruffalo in his underwear and Kristen Dunst even does a great job.

      "Having been written by Charlie Kaufman, \"Eternal Sunshine\" has a fascinating premise and unravels in a way that plays with the flow of time. Jim Carey shows that his excellent work in \"The Truman Show\" was no fluke; he is completely believable as a shy introvert (!). Kate Winslet, as usual, is also very good.As the first part of the movie unfolded, I was completely drawn in and fascinated with the story and characters. However, the middle just seemed to go on and on, adding little to the plot nor my understanding of the characters' relationship. Thankfully, the last 15 minutes moved the plot in new and interesting ways.Compared with Kaufman's \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\" (both of which I'd rate with 10s), \"Eternal Sunshine\" lacked the skillful story-telling to keep me involved throughout. However, its inventive plot and skillful performances saves it from being a disappointment. 6/10\n",

      "The concept was great, and i must say I could relate to joel in this film-in more ways than one-yet perhaps my perspectives on these things is a little different than the average dating man--because for me, well this movie told a basically up to date version of my own. Funny how that works though. I thought I was a little loopy when I started picking up on things in films that correlated to my own life--for instance quotes that are the tag lines of the movies, or in the case of another recent film--\"identity\" which for me had well all correct dates, locations, names, even meta-phorical stuff that perhaps I am the only one to understand. Then there is \"the ring\", Vanilla Sky, Anger management, and now in a funny post sort of way--the eternal sunshine movie. How does that work? You see, I saw \"identity\" while basically at the same time met a girl that lived near \"the elfin forest\" who reminded me very much of another one I loved and lost. This girl would describe herself as just a f---ed up girl looking for her own piece of mind. Anyhow I went on this adventure to find my memories again-and all the while the world was suddenly falling down all around me. So here are a few of the meanings you might not understand in the film---at the beginning she says to call on valentines--well because in the same way in \"identity\" at the coke machine Paris asks for a quarter, and Rhodes drops it---well I should have called that valentines day. At the end of the film in the hallway there is a line, \"I thought you were going to save me, will you wait for me?\" This is because Joel had forgotten about something in his past-something he thought he might have to pay for. When Clementine left him, wrapped his car on the fire hydrant-that signifies 9/11. Believe me it does. At the beginning when there is the names definition conversation--well that is in reference to romeo and juliet---would a rose by any other name smell as sweet? --and notice how smell is one of the better triggers of memory. But how does the movie really end? Would they both rather spend their time alone? Does Joel go off to jail? Does the doctor end up loosing his practice? hmmmmmm--well stay tuned and I am sure shortly another film will come out to explain a bit more up to date detail about it all.\n",

Only a complete idiot would miss the sentiment in this film and resort to slagging off the soundtrack of all things (hint for the last uncultured pleb to comment on this film.)

It has many tricks in terms of the editing which are subtle yet effective and the storyline is excellent. Traveling inside Jim Carrys head is marvelous as it uses many computer generated effects the great advantage.It is worth seeing to find out if you like it or not. Though it can be seen as a girly film its audience should not be restricted to girls alone as I saw it with my boyfriend and he liked it.\n",

      "I was pretty shocked when I left the theater to see how many people coming out hated this film. Not to sound pompous, but it was really that they just didn't get it. I say this, not because I am guessing, but because all these people specifically said \"I didn't get it.\" I think it is because Jim Carrey still suffers from some earlier movie choices. That being said, this movie is fabulous. It is so much more than a love story--it is both brilliantly witty and tragic at the same time, and the entire cast is phenomenal. It's one of those rare movies that you continue to think about after you leave for days (and not thoughts of \"where did my $8.50 go\"). I hated Adaptation, but I think Kaufman has more than made up for it with this film, which skyrocketed to my list of top movies.\n",

      "Thank you Mike and CharlieEternal Sunshine, hands down, is the best film of early 2004. Filled with a brilliant script, visionary directing, some of the best editing seen in years, and performances that burst off the screen, Eternal Sunshine brings a new layer to the careers of all those involved.A good film should pose a question, answer it, and leave room for viewer interpretation. In ESOTSM, the question is: What's the most important part of a relationship-where it takes us, or the memories we obtain while we get there?The film tells the story of Joel Barish (Carrey) a businessman who one day takes an impulsive up the coast. On the train, He meets Clemintine (Winslet). The two connect, but we soon realize that there's more to them than we thought. For the next two hours, Kaufman and Gondry take us on a trip through Barish's mind. SHowing us the fall and rise of the two's relationship, and forcing the views to wonder if this was the best thing that Joel could of done-as he desperately clings to past memories.Though the plot is convoluted, it's the performances of the actors that keep your eyes glued to the screen. Carrey channels the zaniness of his early career into the quiet, contained Joel- bringing a depth to the character that few others could (Think Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love, but with more emotion) If the Academy passes him up for this as they did for Man on the Moon and The Truman Show, I'm gonna have issues with AMPAS. Likewise, Winslet serves as the perfect foil for Joel, acting as the crazy random connection that we all wish we'd make at some point. She brings out the bestin all those around her at all times during the film.In addition to those two, everyone else with their name above the title on the poster puts in a stellar performance. Elijah Wood is just creepy enough to make us like him, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson force the audience to think about the other side of the procedure, and Kirsten Dunst puts Mary-Jane to shame as a girl with more to her than you could ever expect.All this is conducted beautifully by Gondry, who faced with a Kaufman Script, seemingly pulled it straight out of Charlie's messed up head. Shots exist that shouldn't, and all that acting prowess had to come from somewhere. Extra points for the dissolving bookstore and the scene with Joel bathing in the sink.All told, Eternal Sunshine is a film that all should see. It's not a film about love, it's a film about remembering- something that so few of us do anymore-10/10Look of the Film- Joel as a child from under the table.Line of the Film-\"But you will!

      "OK, first of all, I should mention that I went to this movie not because I wanted to see it, but because I was with two friends and it was one of those situations where someone had seen every other film playing at the right time of day and basically it was the \"compromise\" film we could all agree on. I was happily prepared to blame my friends for making me waste my time and money on a film that I should by all rights hate. You see, I detest Jim Carrey. And even more than how much I dislike Jim Carrey, I abhor the untalented and overrated Charlie Kaufman. But there I was, at the $14 a ticket Arclight in Hollywood, watching a film written by a hack, starring a buffoon. Don't tell me you liked Adaptation. Susan Orlean wrote an article in the New Yorker which was inflated into a book despite the fact that there was barely enough story for a magazine article. (The book was a snooze.) Then Charlie Kaufman turns it into a movie about a guy who can't adapt a book--yeah, because the book sucked. So then he resorts to adding wildly unbelievable plot twists to get himself out of the corner he's painted himself into. Just like Being John Malkovich. Another movie that was watchable for about 20 minutes before it all fell apart. But I digress.I'm a fan of Michel Gondry's video work--that Lucas with the Lid Off video was incredible at the time and so was the Rolling Stones one. But I've been disappointed many, many times when watching a video director's attempts at making a full-length feature (Mark Romanek's One Hour Photo and Jonas Akerlund's Spun are two that instantly come to mind) because the visual trickery that is interesting in a music video is never a substitute for plot or character or storytelling or soul in a film. So, I didn't really hold such high hopes in the directorial department either. Man, was I surprised when Jim Carrey didn't completely annoy me as Joel. I mean, sure, he's got his moments, and maybe it was the editing of his performance, but he's not his usual over-the-top ungracious self. And I was blown away by Kate Winslet as Clementine of the ever-changing hair color who I'd formerly been known to call (in my head only) \"Fatty, Fatty Kate Winslet\" after seeing her in the drivelous Titanic and the tear jerkery Iris. In fact, I was so blown away that I actually like her now and would never dream of calling her anything but beautiful. Sure, the plot is unbelievable and hokey and Kirsten Dunst is completely without talent and pumpkinheaded in the role of Mary, but there's something about the coolness of the--dare I admit it--visual trickery that kept me entertained and buying the whole concept of the story. Kaufman's story doesn't unravel this time. (Or at least not as much as in the past). This film is worth seeing just for the CGI effects alone. (Kate Winslet being the other reason to see it). I had to wonder many times just exactly how on earth Gondry pulled off some of those effects. And don't think I figured it out--I wouldn't have the first clue. But it did make for an interesting film and one well worth the ungodly $14 I shelled out to see it.\n",

      "Typically, movies dealing with human consciousness (in the woo-woo, metaphysical sense), even when very well done, scare the pants off of most critics. Something about deep emotion, intuition, or anything new and 'personal' in that sense will usually elicit cries of \"Witch! Witch!\" from most critics. How come this movie was universally beloved? Dunno... Whatever the reason, the critics seem to have got it right, and in this case, I agree with them 100%. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is brave, thoughtful. meaningful, and best of all, exceptionally well done. It is, truly, a masterpiece.Truly an extra-ordinary movie! Any conceivable description of it would be a disservice. Thus, don't try to imagine what the movie is about, or even whether or not you'll like it. Trust the critics and the vast public ravings on this one--- \"Eternal Sunshine...\" is GREAT!!!\n",

      "Have you ever had a relationship that went bad, and you wish you could just forget everything about it? Ever had a person in your life that was nothing but a constant source of irritation?What would you do if you had the opportunity to erase all memory of an individual? Is it worth coping with the bad in order to hang onto the good? Or would it be better to have no recollection at all? These questions are at the root of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\"This is a movie that people will either love or hate.  I can understand why a lot of people won't really care for the movie. If you're expecting \"Bruce Almighty\" or \"Dumb and Dumber,\" then you're going to be sorely disappointed. The movie definitely has some funny moments, but it's not a classic Jim Carrey comedy. Just so you'll know where I'm coming from, let me point out that I love Jim Carrey's crazy antics in movies such as \"Ace Ventura,\" \"Dumb and Dumber,\" etc. But I also like to keep an open mind when he tries something different.Would I ever want to go to the trouble of having some of my memories erased? Nah. Good or bad, my memories constitute who I was, which directly led to who I now am. You start messing with that stuff, and there's no guarantee on what could happen. It's not worth the risk.  Man, I'm such a philosopher!THE GIST:If you're looking for something original and unique, then \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" definitely matches the description. But keep in mind that this is a movie that requires your brain to participate. If you can engage yourself in the movie and take the effort to think about what's going on, then you should enjoy it.

When an actor can do that, it reveals more talent on his part. And the message that the movie portrays is nice. Not anything overwhelmingly deep, but nice.In short, nothing wrong with it.

I even watched both movies again just to be sure. This really is the best movie in existence. The message is so simple but it is one of those things that you just know once you walk out of the theatre but can't even really describe to someone else. Michel Gondry outstrips Spike Jonze in every respect and improves immensely on his last attempt. The characters are neither cute and cuddly nor are they romantically endearing and the movie shows that. Joel drives a '93 Corolla, they both live in small apartments with quirky, yet normal decorations. There isn't anything extraordinary about Joel but Gondry makes him seem like so much more, Clementine seems so outwardly odd that it seems so amazing how the movie shows her to be someone who functions just like the rest of us. One could go on forever, but it must be known, this really is too good of a movie to not watch.\n",

If you're not giving this film 100% of your attention, you're probably not going to like it. Miss something that might have seemed unimportant and someone is going to have to explain things to you as you're walking out of the theatre. And nobody wants to be one of those people, so make sure you're paying attention. The details are what count for the story, and also for what makes this film so well done. The whole movie just comes together perfectly, from the lighting to the score it's just so well done you can't help but notice while you're watching. The movie sort of floats by in front of you, and I found myself lost in waves of images. I honestly felt all disoriented and dreamy for a good few hours after watching it. It more than achieved it's goal. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet were at their finest. Not to mention Kate's ever changing hair colors which only made her more attractive. Wow. I went into Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with very high expectations, and there were all met.\n",

      "A wonderful idea for a movie, but this movie is flawed in more ways than not. This could have been one of my favorite movies of all time if done correctly, and maybe someone will realize the flaws and remake it. The main problem is predictability. There are SO many points in the movie where the fact that he is inside his memory and the beginning is when he wakes up after the operation is BLATANTLY obvious. This would have been so much more fun to watch if I was waiting in suspense, but when the whole idea is revealed so early in the movie, it's not as fun. Also, if the movie occurs as it is filmed, the cycle is unending. The first meeting would be at the gathering on the beach, and then, after a relationship, both would erase each other's memory. During the erasing, they hide from the process just enough to know to meet each other again on the train. Then they go through the relationship again and do it once more. The movie is unclear as to whether this is a one time thing or continuously repetitive. If it is repetitive, it doesn't take into account aging concerns. After they do this 20-30 times, they will be years and years older without having any internal account of how they got that old. I had more problems with the flick, but I saw it so long ago I can't remember them all. Jim Carrey did a good job in his role.\n",

      "Moviemakers have often been fascinated by memory - think of \"Total Recall\" or \"Memento\" - and the medium lends itself well to the realisation of what are above all visual recollections and reconstructions. Here acclaimed scriptwriter Charlie Kaufman displays more of the inventiveness than was so successfully on show in \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\". This time, though, the director is not Spike Jonze, but Michel Gondry, a maker of music videos and commercials, turning his hand for the first time to a full-length feature. In fact, the film often feels like a video, with a grainy and jerky - almost dreamlike - look. The essence of Kaufman's story is the attempt by two unlikely and very different characters to erase the memories of their less than idyllic relationship. Jim Carrie plays withdrawn and melancholic Joel in the most restrained, even rather sad, performance that we have ever seen this from this usually manic comic, while Kate Winslet is totally convincing as Clementine, a cheery and colourful, but wild and impulsive, personality who infuses herself into his life and his heart. When each in turn wishes to blank out the memory of the other, a weird company appropriately called Lacuna offers to do the deed. In an original romantic comedy where one thinks and smiles more than laughs, we are invited to value memories, however uncomfortable or even painful, as part of our experience and identity and possibly capable of being revisited and refashioned. It's all rather indulgent and at times esoteric, but then this is Charlie Kaufman. One wonders how long he can perform these mind tricks before he attempts a more conventional narrative but, in the meanwhile, this a film to be savoured at least once and preferably twice.\n",

      "ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is the story of a couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). Joel is a little insecure and shy, while Clementine is spontaneous and outgoing. One day Joel goes to Clementine's workplace and is surprised and hurt when she acts as though she doesn't know who he is. He later finds out, by accident, that Clementine chose to have her memories of him erased in a surgical process, and decides to do the same. However, once the process has begun, Joel begins to realize that he may not want Clementine erased from his life, and fights to keep those memories.This is a really sweet movie, but not in a sickening or artifical way. It manages to capture the complexities of the brain as well as the many aspects of love. It shows not just the happy, lovey-dovey moments, but the difficult and destructive ones as well. It's a love story above everything else, but it's not cheesy in the least and it has a lot of heart to it--something that most love stories don't have.Going out of chronological order always makes films more interesting, and especially in the case of this movie. We go from Joel and Clementine meeting on the train directly to seeing Joel sobbing in his car, and we have to wonder--what just happened? This movie sucked me in immediately and kept me captivated throughout. But the thing that really impressed me about ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, other than its genuineness, was the acting. Jim Carrey is exceptional as Joel, proving that he can be both funny and sensitive, either in separate roles or in the same one. Kate Winslet is excellent, and the supporting cast is great as well.I don't have a bad thing to say about ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. It's a great movie with excellent acting, good directing, and a lot of heart. A sweet love story, and a lot more. 9/10.\n",

      "I was never a big fan of Being John Malkovich... It was a clever idea, with some memorable scenes, but I never *connected* with the story - it had no personal meaning to me.Eternal Sunshine was different. When the movie finished I was sitting there stunned... It was so beautiful. I guess a recent relationship break-up helped intensify the emotional impact of the movie for me, but the immense creativity and superb dialogue made sure it wasn't just a routine chick flick.I also loved how the various pieces of the puzzle, past, present, surreal, were weaved together in a way that didn't require huge concentration to work out what was going on. I found it possible to be absorbed into the movie and by the end everything gently slotted into place.A friend of mine (OK, the girl i just broke up with) has had trouble drumming up sufficient motivation to see the movie because of the presence of the rubber faced man in the lead role. It is strange casting, but I think it works. The reason is probably that he plays more of his real self and less of the guy on stage cracking jokes. And Kate Winslett is just wonderful as usual.\n",

      "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was a very inspiring and beautiful movie. I was skeptical at first about Jim Carey being in it, thinking that he might play the comic role and might not be able to bring much to a drama, but i was wrong. He played the confused, desperate, and self-loathing character very well. The movie is one of my favorites because it shows how powerful our emotions can get: sometimes we hate the one we're with and wish we'd never met them and other times we remember the good things; and ultimately we hold on to the good things, even if just for a little while longer. The movie portrayed all these things and more. Also, the jagged, upsidedown way the move was filmed added to the brilliance of it by mirroring the way our mind works and the selective way it holds on to certain memories. I don't know about euros, but this movie was worth every dollar i laid down.\n",

Some of the piano tracks, as simple as they are may just be some of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. \"Strings that tie to you\" is truly magnificent. Jon Brion has completed a great soundtrack that fully captures the true meaning of the film and I believe deserves Academy Award recognition for it. It's not just Jon Brion's work that impressed me either. Beck's \"Everbody's gotta learn sometime\" is a pleasure to listen to, as is \"Mr. Blue Sky\".

Yeah, two horny teen-agers, jumping up and down on beds, s***faced drunk, while performing a delicate medical procedure? And what the hell was Tom Wilkinson doing in this film?

      "Seems like we like films dealing with memory loss.  Always have.  But the recent Memento (2000) has seemed to generate a few more movies (there are hundreds, just put amnesia into the IMDB plot search engine)in which individuals have challenges - Mulholland Drive (2001) and Fifty First Dates (2004) are good examples, with even Ellen DeGeneres' Dory in Finding Nemo putting a humourous touch to the genre.  But did I say genre?  Because \"Eternal Sunshine\" sort of backs into the situation in what should be frightening fashion but has us exulting in the ultimate outcome.  Jim Carrey's Joel determines that erasing the memory of his relationship with his long-time girlfriend will be the answer to the pain he feels when he finds she has had HER memory removed.  The lab and the technical background, the physician (Tom Wilkinson) and the technical staff (Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elihah Wood) are darned funny in their own right, adding a terrific touch to the credibility of the situation.  What ensues, however, is not what we suspect will occur - at all.  And there is the reason to follow the excellent story as the director (and most significantly Carrey) lead us towards the memorable conclusion.\n",

      "What really strikes you is how cold it always looks. Most of the time in romantic comedies, the sun is always warmly shining and the colours are bright and vibrant. Here Michael Gondry has used a very drab and muted colour palate for almost every scene, and occasionally added a snow drift too small and wind-swept to be festive, but perfect for depressing the cold and lonely. Compare the beach so often featured in this movie to the one in Something's Gotta Give for a perfect example.Gondry's images create a visual experience in which Charlie Kaufman's latest screenplay can work to best effect. In a lighter, more cinematic, world, Jim Carrey's protagonist would have seemed impossibly inhibited, and there would seem no reason why he and Clementine couldn't live happily ever after from the moment they met. But this movie looks too much like a real cold and cloudy morning in February for us to harbour any such delusions. Life is never like in the movies, but only the best movies acknowledge the fact.Practically everything about this movie's depiction of dreams is as perfect as it logically can be, right down to the books you can see but can't read. It recognizes that when your subconscious chooses to mix and match, it has no respect whatsoever for what you would consciously consider to be normal. And it also does not delude us that if lots of our memories were erased, we would actually miss them. How much do you actually remember? If you cast your mind back and encountered a blank, would you suspect something, or just figure nothing worth remembering had happened?The movie also strikes a nice balance between pure philosophizing and more accessible comedy content. While the mental intricacies go on inside Jim Carrey's sleeping head, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood display a contempt for his sleeping form and his apartment unworthy of a lab rat. The contrast works even better than it sounds.Kaufman's screenplay here is actually his own original work, which makes it all the more remarkable. In recent years, mainstream Hollywood seems to have taken up a fascination with the ins and outs of the human mind and memory, but depressingly often this simply amounts to nothing more than loose adaptations of Philip K. Dick short stories. I for one welcome something a little more complex.\n",

      "Kaufman is one of the few writers in Hollywood original enough to be a real pull factor for moviegoers and in this outing is his best to date.Kaufman's script is good enough to allow some real empathy for the characters to develop. Anyone who's been through the ups and downs of a relationship or even the bittersweetness in separations will find something in this film for them. Gondry has allowed the \"wormy mind\" of Kaufman - whom I suspect invests a lot of himself in the characters he portrays - to live on film and here, the cast should be given kudos. Even Jim Carrey, who is usually guilty of overacting, manages to put in more subtlety than usual. Only once, somewhere near the very end, did he lift the lid up enough for us to see a glimpse of the same IL' Carrey but thankfully, that scene is fairly short.The production design and special effects are truly first class - I'd be upset if they weren't somehow recognised for this at Oscar time.One of the more original Hollywood films in a while. 8.5 out of 10\n",

Every relationship has its ups and its down, some of us may fail to realize that things aren't going to be peaches and cream all the time and we must not let the bad times outweigh the good times. Not going to go too far into an explanation. All I can say is that you MUST see this movie. Jim Carry and Kate Winslet were excellent in this.

      "(spoiler alert)I'll keep this review short and sweet. I enjoyed this movie very much. ESOTSM is a poignant, bittersweet exposition on everyone's innate longing for love. I highly recommend it for those looking for a thoughtful, well crafted movie that will also make you feel good.The most common complaints of ESOTSM are the disjointed plot and surreal, impressionistic cinematography. Far from being detrimental, these aspects are key devices used to convey the chaotic nature of the human mind. Since a large majority of the film is spent inside Jim Carey's mind, it makes sense that many of these scenes don't make sense.In fact, the actual order of events is not that hard to grasp. The movie starts on Valentines day, and then flashes back to a few days prior. When inside Carey's mind, the memories generally proceed in reverse chronological order (starting with their break up and ending with their first meeting), interspersed with scenes of the Lacuna technicians. The ending then picks up where the beginning left off.Of course I didn't give go into any detail because that would spoil the fun. But don't get discouraged if you don't get the film the first time - I liked ESOTSM so much I watched it again immediately after the first viewing, to fully appreciate all the subtle nuances. It doesn't have to all make sense right away - great art is like that sometimes.\n",

      "(Spoilers Included)In a semi-sci-fi setting, former lovers Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey) respectively seek professional help to erase each other's memories, in order to move on easily. The audience learns their history through Joel's dream, while the memory-erasing process is ongoing and Joel in his dream, being afraid to lose Clementine, fights against it. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the most twisted rom-com ever made, is an appropriate representation of how people express love nowadays, and proves that our complicated modern world and the 100-year-old film media are still in synch.As the film progresses, the opening sequence, which the viewers would perceive as their first encounter, turns out to be their second meeting after their losses of each other's memories. In this film, this cliched amnesia gimmick does work, re-shifting the audience's brain and mind along with the fragmented development of Clementine and Joel's relationship.To enhance the twisted screenplay that only Charlie Kaufman can write, the director Michel Gondry uses low cinematic techniques (cinematography, editing, and post-production), most meaningfully and most effectively, probably for the first time since Godard.\n",

Whoever reads this, go and watch this movie, and then start thinking why we all need memories - they make us the persons we are!At first it seems like a typical boy-meets-girl story. A man and a woman falling in love. But then it turns out they had been knowing each other, they had separated and wanted to forget bad memories.When, however, Joel's memories are to be deleted, he realizes that he does not want to lose them. He tries to escape, as if you try to wake up during a nightmare when you feel you are dreaming.The story moves back and forward as in a dream, it does not seem to be logical, but it is. Kaufmann makes the implausible seem plausible!\n",

      "1999 saw a bright new development in independent cinema from the states. You had in that year American Beauty, Magnolia, Three Kings, Fight Club and Being John Malkovich. Since then there have been several other really good films like Memento, Punch Drunk Love and most recently Lost in Translation. These have all paved the way for the most remarkable film of this ilk - The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.For too long now films dealing with human relationships have either fallen into the sappy sentimentality or are just cold. No one has tried a relationship film with special effects let alone have them work so gently to enhance the story.Every element of this film works from Kaufman's deep engaging script to Gondry's subtle direct, to Kuras' beautiful cinematography to Carrey and Winslet's perfect performances to Jon Brions extraordinary score. It is so rare that everything works so completely. If I did have a criticism it might be of the subplot with Ruffalo, Dunst and Wilkinson but I could see how it was essential in the framework of the story - it's just that the main story worked so perfectly you didn't want to shift from it.Lots of people have liked this film. I liked it more the second time I saw it and cannot wait for the DVD Until it does I highly recommend the DVD the Work of Director Michel Gondry - it contains most of his work as a music video director - and you can see from it that he is one of the most creative minds of our age\n",

      "Having loved the other two Charlie Kaufman movies I'd seen, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, I was eagerly looking forward to this one, which may be part of the reason that at first I was a bit underwhelmed.  The early part of the film is pretty much all set up for the later part, and while it's not bad, it's not exceptional.  But once the movie gets going, it goes all the one, creating an exhilarating and utterly fascinating experience that is funny, touching and wildly imaginative.  I can't help but feel the movie probably would have been better had it been directed by Spike Jonez, whose sensibility seems to perfectly compliment Kaufman's, and as much as I enjoyed the film, overall I felt the two Jonez movies were better.  I don't think Jonez could have improved the movie's second half much, as it was wonderful, but I think he would have made the early scenes more compelling.  But that's just a theory, and the fault may like in the writing rather than the direction.  Overall though, a great movie, brilliantly conceived and with a wonderful and telling end.\n",

      "Familiar \"What is real and what is not? Are we looking at reality or self-referential inspection?\" territory from Charlie Kaufman. Adaptation did this switchback brilliantly, but \"Eternal Sunshine\" only just fails to scale such heights.Having got that off my chest I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a \"thinking feel-good\" movieI always found Jim Carrey extremely talented but that he had been shoe-horned into various face-contorting roles. Small diversion here. I first watched the Truman Show, having missed the first 5 minutes set-up. The \"set-up\" gives away the whole film at the start. Hence, through the film I was discovering the constructed reality along with Truman - creepy and clever. Point of this diversion, I really rate Carrey's ability to portray slightly confused, slightly \"disconnected\" characters who are just waiting to burst out of their self-create prisons. This technique serves Carrey ably in \"Eternal Sunshine\". He is able to hold the twists and turns of plot and time so I traveled a fine balance between confusion and clarity. Which, to me, is one of the themes of the film.Mark Ruffalo is a complete revelation as the nerdy Stan; I forgot his muscular performance in \"In the Cut\" with Meg Ryan.Kate Winslet is believably spontaneous as Clementine.Strong performances too from Tom Wilkinson, and Kirsten Dunst.\n",
      "1498\n",
      "Maybe it is all my fault ¬ñ the story was written by Michel Gondry, CharlieKaufman and Pierre Bismuth ¬ñ so it is quite natural for me to associate the story with some of the outstanding works that have producted earlier. Like ¬ëMeeting John Malkovich', ¬ëAdaptation' and MTVs of Bjork, etc.  Too high expectation.Another mistake ¬ñ Jim Carrey paired up with Kate Winslat, Elijah Woods paired up with Kate Winslat. it is just not working. You cannot find any chemistrybetween them even though it is the first time you see this combination. They are not attracted to each other at all.It is contradicting that the film is marketed as Comedy/ Science fiction. Jim Carrey is not equal to comedy!  This film can be categorized as Drama.  Thecharacter development has been done pretty well.  Through the memoryerasing process, Joel (by Jim Carrey) finds out that actually he did has some happy times with Clementine (by Kate Winslat) that he did not want to forgo. That's how he dives into his deeper conscious that he has not had a chance to reveal long time ago -- his humiliated childhood.  This is how his characterbeing formed.  Joel becomes a dull and boring person. \n",
      "The sub story led by Kirsten Dunst is too weak to be developed into anotherlinked by separate line.  However, the film is more prone to convinced some sort of ideology. Unlike the previous work of Kaufman, the wonderful screenplay or storyline has carried the audience in the film like riding on a rollercoaster.  It is a surprising twist in each brand new page and leaving you unable not to admirehis creativity and talents.  However, please do not expect such kind of story line in this film.The film explores the topic of destiny.  If something is destined to be happened, although in the process, it has been erased, at last it will happened again. Or some one you truly love, no matter what in between has separated the couple(like erasing the memory), you are destined to meet your guy/lady another time.I am not particularly fond of this ideology, so I left the auditorium withdisappointment. And which to erase this film in my memory too.\n",

      "I saw this movie as I really enjoyed 'Adaptation' one of Charlie Kaufmann's other screenplays.Some reviews were not encouraging but its nice to be able to say it was very memorable. A virtuoso technical achievement and strangely moving.My enthusiasm has been further ignited by other comments which I have read on IMDb. This movie seems to make people peculiarly eloquentThe acting of the two leads is impressive and above all the theme of memory is an endlessly powerful one to exploreI think this film will bring people together. It shows us our courage and our vulnerability\n"

      "Rating: **** (out of *****)Once again, Charlie Kaufman is taking us inside someone's brain. True, he has already done that in two of his most famous screenplays, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Yet, incredibly, he has managed to make his latest situation feel inventive and fresh, and the result has been the usual critical praise...although in my opinion the film may be slightly overrated. To me, Kaufman has never been able to really hide his smugness in his screenplays. But under director Michel Gondry (best known to me for that innovative \"White Stripes in Lego\" music video) he keeps this aspect of himself quieter than usual.The plot seems simple enough. Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) meets Clementine (Kate Winslet, again convincingly hiding the fact that she's British), falls in love and has a long-term relationship with her. Once day, however, he finds that she has gone through a process to erase every memory of their relationship from her brain. Shocked, he consults the doctor behind this process (Tom Wilkinson) and decides to go through it himself, but while it is happening to him, he discovers that he doesn't really want her to leave his mind after all.If you think this makes the film sound a little simplistic, don't be fooled. I'm just not revealing very much. Like Being John Malkovich before it, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind plays mind games with its audience, twisting and turning the complex screenplay so much that it's easy to get lost. Stay in there, though, and you will really appreciate the experience. You'll also find some really good jokes.Yet you do feel that there could be something more to this film than there is. The one significant problem with Eternal Sunshine is the lack of real involvement with the characters. I wonder if this the result of Kaufman and Gondry concentrating too much on the story itself ¬ñ they do a great job there, no doubt about it, but I think that the film needs just a little bit more character depth for me to call it excellent.That is no fault of the actors. In fact, this is an actors' film. Jim Carrey continues to show his strengths as a serious actor, and has a good chemistry with Kate Winslet. Even though Winslet is forced to act slightly out of character here ¬ñ to put it bluntly, Clementine seems excessively eccentric ¬ñ she does so admirably. The supporting cast, which includes Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood (now free from having to carry the One Ring) and Kirsten Dunst, play it deadpan throughout, which is essential to the success of the film.\n",
      "I may have my reservations, but I'm still highly recommending this. Eternal Sunshine fits in nicely with the really good films that are surfacing during the spring and summer months to date.\n",

      "Rated as one of the best comedies released this year, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind looked promising when you take into consideration its abundance of famous faces, including the hilarious Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst. However, Hollywood's A-list was wasted on this mundane and complicated storyline from the writers of the equally strange Being John Malkovitch. The story centres on the relationship between dull and boring Joel Barish (Carrey) and outrageous and impulsive Clementine (Winslet), complete with rainbow coloured hair. The pair fall in love and all appears well until Joel discovers Clementine has undergone a radical procedure to erase all memories of him as a result of her unhappiness. Subsequently, Joel decides to go through the procedure himself. During the memory-erasing process however, he realises just how precious his memories of Clem are and attempts to outrun the erasers. I spent the rest of the film wishing I'd brought some paracetamol or a book.Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst are responsible for erasing the memories from Joel's mind and carry out the process in a highly professional and conventional manner - They have sex, drink excessively and get high on dope while tampering with Joel's brain. And I thought the NHS was bad. Although the acting was of a high standard, it was difficult to see Carrey in a film that didn't require his trademark rubber faces and classic voices.Consequently, I found I had to make a concerted effort to take his unusually sombre character seriously. Overall, although some may see Sunshine as an endearing look at fate and the promotion of the ideology of living for the moment and letting life take its natural course, for me, it was merely an awkward collocation of love and science that possesses credibility purely from its famous cast. I wouldn't mind erasing this film from my memory.\n",

      "I don't usually go for love stories. I don't know, maybe it's the whole sappy bit that pulls me out of it. Maybe that's why I loved this movie. Although it is a \"love story,\" it is unlike any love story put to celluloid. The lovers are not perfect, their love is imperfect. They fight, yell, insult each other. They don't share any epically romantic moments, but only little things that are so much more beautiful for their simplicity. Eating Chinese food and watching an old movie, or sitting in a car outside of a drive-in, making up your own lines for the movie, a la MST3K; these are moments of romance that we can relate to and feel empathetic to. Maybe it's that. Maybe it's the fact that their love is true, and survives all of their arguments and trivial fights. Well, it did survive, until Clementine decided to go out and erase Joel from her memory. Maybe it's because I can relate to the story that I love this movie so much, the tale of a man who, in an act of spite, does something that ruins his love. He realizes his mistake too late, and desperately fights to cling to what little he has left. Some of the most beautiful quotes of all time (in my opinion, anyways) come from this movie. I would list them, but that would ruin some of the movie for you. Point being is that this is not your average love story. This is not a tale of \"two star-crossed lovers\" or any of that bull. This is a tale of two very human, very real people, and the love between them. Simply put, this film is one-of-a-kind and a work of pure art. I truly consider it one of the best films of all time.A+Flawless, incredibly touching, and excruciatingly heart-breaking. Go experience it and form your own opinion. Mere words cannot encompass the masterpiece that this is. Enjoy\n",

      "It's very annoying to see films of this type being advertised as a comedy. If you say the film is a comedy and has Jim Carey people will always expect Ace Ventura. But hey, that's the only (or easy) way for marketing to promote a film of this caliber. Rest assured many people fooled by the deception will very likely find they enjoy this 'black' comedy that has a lot to say about memory and love and pain.The film shows us what love is about and how to hate someone is simply an extension of that same love. Questioning the idea of having painful memories removed and if you will loose the benefit of not repeating past mistakes.Without contradicting myself I would have to say this is almost a comedy but mostly a drama. Not sure I would even think of this as science fiction, more fantasy really. A romantic film in a traditional sense of the word (rose tinted look of the world) and can't say that bothers me in the slightest.This film made me think about what it is to be in love and the old saying \"it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.\"\n",

      "This review contains a spoiler concerning the presentation of a theme, and not a plot detail.I was expecting a sequential journey, of Carey meeting Winslet, having her erased, and then seeing them meet by chance again. What i saw was unexpected. The way in which the pre-erasure relationship was only presented through the task of remembering(That was my spoiler)) and deleting in Carey's mind not only confused, but entertained. I left the Plymouth Vue feeling slightly enlightened. the film makes you care for individuals who are experiencing something fantastical, and that for me is what sets the film apart. It is funny, it is heartwarming and entertaining, but then so is every other film. what makes this one so different is the idea that you can erase memories. it succeeds in making you feel for its protagonists and really makes you think...what if you really COULD erase every bad memory?..(c)nm 2004.Nicholas Moore 2004PW Stage TwoDartington College Of Arts.\n",

      "Bloke seeks medical help to have memories of a romance removed from his brain, the film is then more or less a journey of what's going on in his head as the memories are erased. Quite quirky and fairly original, spoiled by silly childrens TV type music that kills any tension or mood and unbelievable medical staff - boozing, drug taking and cavorting round whilst doing brain surgery? - you'll see what I mean. Thoughtful in places and poignant at the end as the memories take their leave of each other. Jim and Katie's acting is really rather good, especially Kate's American accent - not bad for a girl from Berkshire. It's an OK movie, 7 outta 10. Cheers\n",

      "Jim Carey may be one of the best comics alive today, evolving from In Living Color to his own standup to GREAT movies like the Mask, but after the disappointment of Me and Irene and Bill Almighty I was really praying for something I could sink my teeth into, after even Dumb and Dumber was MADE funny by his acting to a large part. But here confusion and thin plot rule this film and Jim's talent become lost once again, buried behind poor writing, poor cinematography, and poor character development. Nice soundtrack keeps the movie moving at all. Too many beach scenes, too much unexplained, and just too much nothing that has nothing to do in the picture so I suppose bad editing can be added to the list. Jim, you're funny, and as I said before perhaps the funniest (way funnier than Seinfeld and Sandler) so go for it, find the right script and make another great one, you certainly have the talent, don't make it 4 mediocre films in a row.\n",

      "ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MINDHow happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd. -- Alexander Pope, \"Eloisa to Abelard\"Teaming the writer of Being John Malkovich, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Adaptation with the director of music videos (Bjork, Massive Attack), award-winning commercials and feature-film Human Nature should've always seemed like an exciting combination.Writer Charlie Kaufman has an amazing creative bent that requires skill from a director to successfully bring to the screen. If you've seen Being John Malkovich you'll know what I mean.What if, following a painful relationship split, you could erase the all memory of your ex-partner? That's the premise behind this creative yet important film which centers around the relationship of Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslett).Joel's met the woman of his dreams, but apparently (we don't see it early on) it starts to go pear shaped and he discovers she's had him removed from her memory. Unable to deal with this, Joel decides to have the same treatment done. He must gather all items in his house which relate to her in any way, deliver them to the clinic, then doctors go to his home to perform the 'brain damage'. During the operation, one of the young doctors falls for the girl they are removing from Joel's head, and armed with the knowledge of what she likes, starts dating her. During the memory operation however, Joel changes his mind and attempts to mentally evade the brain washing, so he can try to mend his relationship with Celementine.If we are destined to be with someone, will removing the memory of a previous experience with them, prevent it from happening again? All our life experience has led us to a point where we behave in a certain way. Having the memory of an experience removed is arguably useless as we are predestined to live it. It's a thoroughly fascinating idea from Kaufman delivered in a funny, quirky, poignant and very moving way by the director Michel Gondry.I'm not known for my love of romantic films, but this film made me realise that anyone who's experienced love will be touched by a romance film, as long as it's packaged the right way. Sleepless in Seattle is not for me. This film definitely is.\n",

      "It took this film student rather to long to realise what this film is - physical narrative. Yep, we haven't seen anything like this since Charlie Chaplin. A pure visual narrative, where dialogue is derived from physical action and not spoken word.Why should you see this film? Because you like challenge & don't care about endings or structure.What Age is this film aimed at? 30+ Anyone below this age has not had enough time to create a sculpture of what a relationship looks like and then break it down into components.Why do the critics think this film is brilliant? Because it tells a story in a manner that no one else has told it for the past 70yrs. A story told through behaviour and not dialogue.Why Jim Carrey & Kate Winslett? To challenge us. We associate these actors with a certain style. To see them in this film is to not only realise that we can't type-caste them, but to realise the importance a script plays in controlling our expectations. The image is so powerful that we forget Jim & Kate & see their characters only.Why see this film? Because you want to see unconventional ideas. You feel emotionally brave enough. You feel able to handle change. You are ready to see the behaviour of relationship without the comfort of language. Dialogue is used as punctuation to accentuate change in thought, it is not the end in its self as is customary in modern cinema. If you want a challenge that is intelligent & fun, then this film evokes emotions that we have no names for because we are not used to physically driven narratives.

Carrey and Winslet suprises me with their striking performance.The script is sophisticated and Gondry creates an amazing visual experience. The sound effects and music fits the pictures perfectly. It's a very interesting and different film visually but also with a creative content. The whole film circles round our memories, the happy ones but also the heavy, sad memories that haunts us for the rest of our lives.At first the movie felt a little boring but I lost myself in it's beauty more and more as it went along.

Clearly if he wasn't in Hollywood they would have locked him away a long time ago!Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was a very good film, but I could totally see why many disliked it... Often confusing and I fear many would have spent the first half waiting for Jim Carrey to do his 1994-1998 thing! But this is a role he should be proud of even if he is not recognised for it.Gondry has made a fine step from music video's to movies.After thinking about it I felt the film depressed me, the whole scenario seems so sad and desperate.WATCH IT.8/10\n",

      "With downbeat - and arguably misleading - promotion prior to release, I'd almost expected this to be a comedic take on \"Vanilla Sky\", with Carrey in his usual spoof role. What I found instead was a unique blend of \"Memento\" and \"Being John Malkovich\"; Carrey instead playing the introverted and awkward Joel, who comes to realize the value of painful memories.I won't spoil the storyline here, but Winslet is radiant as Clementine, and Dunst performs admirably as the tragic Mary. This is, for me, undoubtedly one of this year's most surprisingly interesting offerings. Well worth a look in.\n",

      "SPOILER ALERT!!It begins with a madcap urge by Joel (Carrey) to ditch work and board a train to Montauk, Long Island.  He meets Clementine (Winslet) on the train....she's as crazy it would seem, yet they connect in a way as if they are long lost friends, notwithstanding they seem like total opposites. Their relationship doesn't force their chemistry down our throats......they are so imperfect, you see bits of yourself. The end result is that you are left rooting for the characters to find a way out of their eventual predicament.The affair ends badly and Clementine decides to have her memories of Joel erased.  Upon finding out, he opts to investigate and also have it done. The writing is crisp, winning, funny and poignant with Carrey asking Wilkinson (Doctor Howard - I cannot begin to spell or pronounce his surname), if the procedure causes brain damage, he responds in turn, \"Well technically, it is brain damage.\"What happens is a virtual topsy turvy approach to story telling, which involves freely fast forwarding, rewinding, pausing etc to give the audience snippets of the good and bad times of their relationship.  It is a deep, resonating treatise on how valuable memories are to us all.Joel in the middle of the procedure decides he doesn't want to go through with it.  He desperately tries to hold onto some memories with Clementine, but they are consistently wiped out by associates of Dr. Howard, played by Ruffalo, Wood and Dunst.  The sub plot involving these four characters is involving, and equally engaging.   However, it is difficult to explain and too revealing even if I try.  It's a great testimony in keeping with a certain bank's identity theft ads though....that's the most I can say and adds to the central theme of the movie.  It even tosses in the ethical dilemma of the procedure for good measure.There are times when you can't help think, this movie is going to head off track and /or burst at the seams, but surprisingly it never does, thanks largely to stellar directing, and never before seen performances by both Carrey and Winslet and the supporting cast.  I've got to admit, after \"The Truman Show\" Carrey demonstrated that he was versatile and earned some respect from me.  The fact that he burrows into this character, is just mesmerizing. Winslet's matching performance varies from need, craziness, longing........just as her hair color does in the movie.  Then there are some other \"incidental\" factors:  the brilliant script, cinematography and set design, which ably propels the story.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is the best movie I have seen in recent years: thought provoking, visually pleasing, emotionally moving and soothing. It has exercised the full potential of movie making.SPOILER WARNING!!!! In a way similar to Momento (2000) and 21 Grams (2003), I was trying to figure out the time sequence as the movies ran. Except this time it is the couple's relationship in Joel's nightmarish erasure. Contrary to the other two purely rational analyses, this one urged me to feel sorry for Joel.The imaginative flow of Joel's memory mixed up with the interference of the procedure is like a stream of consciousness filled with predicament. It is visually pleasing and free. Initially I was trying to think, then I just feel, let it happen and \"enjoyed it.\" It felt great!The earlier his memory dates back, the more I felt sorry for this guy who had been neglected since he was young. In a way he was saved/dragged out of his grimness by the extrovert Clem, despite his misunderstanding of her flirting around and their inability in carrying out intellectual conversations.Jim Carrey's performance is so great that I can't stopped myself from weeping when he murmured with such sadness, \"I wish I had stayed. I wish I had stayed\" as the water washed away the sand in the beach house. Things are over no matter how much you regret and feel sad about it. Yet on the other hand, you never know what might happen once you admit your emotion.Both Joel and Clem are not particularly lovable characters in the movie as in some Hollywood comedies, but it is this quality that makes the movie so close to real life - that many love affairs are unexplainable yet memorable and that's what keep us going.Apart from the sequence, the movie also forces you to ponder what is involved in a relationship. One thing always come up in breakups is misunderstanding caused by miscommunication. This is clearly revealed in the couple's listening to each other's tapes. I have a feeling that after this ordeal, they will know each other better and their relationship will be fortified.Another strong message is the predominance of fate/destiny, a theme comparable with Sliding Doors (1998). Even after her memory of Joel is erased, Clem is still the extrovert girl who goes up to Joel and starts a relationship; Mary is still the little fan who falls in love with the professional. So what is the point of erasing our memory? Just forget the past and/but relive it again? If our mind is spotless, will there be eternal sunshine?One of the values of memory is that we can build on it and learn from it. If we lose it and commit the same mistakes again it will be tragic. Mary's action hit a positive note on the whole notion and glues Joel and Clem back together, making them feel better about each other. We do have spots in our mind and we have to learn to live with it. Perhaps that's why the film is set in gloomy weather and even the ending is set in dimly lit, maze-like indoors. Such is life!Budding in Being John Malkovich (1999) and growing in Adaptation (2002), Charlie Kaufman has blossomed in this one in terms of exploring the human mind. I am looking forward to seeing this movie again and again. Visually, intellectually and emotionally overwhelming and pleasing. Witty plot, great script, excellent acting, awesome visual effects and warming to the heart at the end. A must see.\n",

      "For some reason Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise jumped to my mind, but ESotSM is shown in more depth, and from another angle. I still need to watch The Truman show in full, but i know that Jim Carrey is a reliable actor, he can play as a crazy guy, as well as in serious movies, it really doesn't make any difference for him. He's very flexible. In this movie, Carrey once again makes a top-class acting appearance.The special effects in the movie are really good. They're very simple, but very effective, and complete the scenes very well. I really didn't know what to expect from the movie, my friend just dragged me to the cinema, but as far as this movie is concerned, i put a vote of 10/10 for what it is.\n",

      "spoilers warning !!Comparison of Eternal Sunshine with two other films based on Kaufman's scripts is inevitable. While all three are oozing creativity, Being John Malkovich is still the best, because of the richness of its contents (some even say that it's trying to tackle too many subject matters). Adaptation I do not particular appreciate, because of its lack of coherence. As to Sunshine, while many will undoubtedly disagree, I would suggest that it is so mainstream that it is the most un-Kaufman. This however does not take anything away from its brilliance.The plot is creative but nowhere near Being JM in originality. Movies about what goes on in the mind are quite common (even the incumbent Governor of California has appeared in one). Nor is temporal displacement a rare treat now, not after Memento and 21 Grams. Beside, what Sunshine does in that department is really quite mild. Strip away the dazzling camera technique, dexterity of editing and imaginative visual composition, Sunshine is an affecting story of two lovers trying to erase the other from their mind, except that this time it is literally. The main body of the story, which is the approximately 70% of the movie in the middle, occurs with Joel (Jim Carrey) lying in his apartment with his brain wired to the memory erasing machine. The story progresses on two levels: what goes on in Joel's mind and the actual physical happenings of the team around him working on erasing the memory of Clem (Kate Winslet) from his mind. The two levels are brilliantly connected. In the first place, Joel is aware, in a certain layer of his consciousness, what goes on around him (for example, he can hear them). Then, what happens around him has bearing on his life, not only in the narrow context of the team carrying out his instructions. For example, one team member is trying to pick up Clem, a most unethical and unprofessional behaviour. Even more importantly, another team member's own personal woes prompts her to actions that lead to a renewal of his relationship with Clem.Despite the dazzling presentation, the vicissitude of the relationship between the pair, depicted mainly as what goes on in Joel's mind during the erasing process, is a familiar path that most people have walked. There is also a hidden symmetry in the movie: while we are not privy to the earlier process of Clem erasing Joel from her mind, it should be quite similar to Joel's. There is symmetry, however, at the end, when they hear the tape recording of how they talked about each other before the erasing process: honest to the point of hurting but not without room for tolerance and reconciliation. The two leads, not always a sure-fire, both score on this one. Carrey plays an uncharacteristically subdued role, coming across more like Ewan McGregor, just as McGregor comes across like Carrey in Big Fish. Winslet, as usual, fares much better here in slightly offbeat roles (e.g. Holy Smoke) than in main stream ones (e.g. Titanic). The supporting cast that plays the memory erasing team deserves full attention. Veteran Tom Wilkinson, who is worth watching every time, plays the owner of the memory erasing outfit. Mark Ruffalo, after the sensuous detective in In The Cut, plays a typical IT-guy-next-door, bringing out the sensitivity and kindness underneath a very ordinary character. Kirsten Dunst, no longer the razor-sharp prot√©g√© in Mona Lisa Smile, starts out as another next-door type character, non-essential and dismissible, until it turns out that she has her own little story which indirectly put her in a pivoting role in the development of the plot. Elijah Wood, the last member fo the team, is also more than what meets the eyes.  In conclusion, despite the summary line, this is good vintage Kaufman, second only to Being John Malkovich.\n",

      "***Possible Spoilers***One of the most creative and heart-warming/wrenching films I've seen in a long time...The films follows Joel (Carrey) who's girlfriend, Clementine (Winslet), has him erased from her memory after a row (she's very spontaneous!). In desperation Joel prescribes the same treatment on himself, but whilst undergoing the procedure realizes that he wants to hold on to his memories of Clementine. As each memory is erased, he jumps to the next in reverse chronological order to try and salvage what he can.I won't reveal anymore, save to say that the film highlights that those who are meant for each other will invariably end up together.Superb - 10/10PS. The film has a great Soundtrack too!\n",

      "The movies that I've found to be brilliant are the ones that cannot be stereotyped easily into the neat little boxes marked 'romantic comedy' or 'murder mystery' or 'action'. Several timeless movies cannot be categorized in this way and yet are able to blow the viewer away with the subtle intelligence, originality and masterful storyline. Focus Features presents a movie directed by Michel Gondry: 'Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind', which is one such movie.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) meets the zany, impetuous, blue haired Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and they form an instant connection. Sparks fly, and thus begins a beautiful relationship. But months later, their relationship begins to crumble and although desperately in love, they realize its not going to work and they part ways. Always impulsive, Clementine checks herself into a medical clinic by the name 'Lacuna Inc.' run by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). This clinic runs on new found technology which allows a person to erase out a person or relationship from their life completely, so that the next morning they awake, fresh and reborn. A few days later Joel decides that perhaps they should give their relationship another chance, and he shows up at her workplace, finding she has absolutely no idea who he is. After finding out about her treatment, in complete frustration and despair, he checks himself in for the same procedure.  With stories running parallel to this, one focusing on the dynamics between Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst) and Dr.Howard and another concerning Patrick (Elijah Wood) and Clementine: secrets are revealed which are oddly touching and the script is gripping right up to the very end.Having never seen Jim Carrey play a serious role before other than in the several years old 'Truman Show' and the unsuccessful `The Majestic'; I was shocked at how precisely he portrayed the character of a passionate, brooding, mysterious and introverted man. He did an astounding job, erasing all memories of past movies such as 'Ace Ventura', 'The Mask' and 'Me, Myself and Irene' which had categorized him into the weirdly facially expressive, hysterically funny, comedic actor. Kate Winslet, as expected, did an exceptional job acting out the role of a free spirited, energetic young woman; which she'd captured audiences many times prior with roles such as in 'Holy Smoke', 'Iris' and of course 'Titanic. And then, of the supporting roles played by Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood; it was Kirsten whose acting stood out the most, although everyone played their parts beautifully. Dunst played the part of an idealistic, though by the end a jaded young woman, similar to her role in 'Crazy Beautiful', which reinforced the ending and made it as memorable as it was.The screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, known for \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation', as well as 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,' created a brilliant film. Parallel to the storyline for 'Being John Malkovich', it is an oddly touching love story, one with many surprises.  Kaufman, in 'Adaptation' has written another script that defies convention, but this time it's in a way we can all easily relate to, and rarely alienates. But with `Adaptation,' Kaufman is growing as a screenwriter, and taking more chances. And similar to the recent 'Confessions', the plotline is transfixing and constantly evolving.  Director Michel Gondry, whose first movie was 'Human Nature' was also written by Charlie Kauffman, did a phenomenal job. Gondry, previously a music video director, seems to be bringing the characters to life, and making the story so real, that it really seems that Kauffman and Gondry make a fantastic pair whilst working together.If you liked 'Vanilla Sky' and you'd like to see a movie with intense, passionate characters; a very original script deviating from the norm of love stories; powerful acting with a brilliant cast, and a slight dark side; this is one movie you've got to see. Box office records show that the movie has made over 30 million dollars in the US so far, and is still in theatres. Being dubbed a critics favorite, it is a poignant story set in a clever plot amidst exceptional performances, which Margaret A. McGurk summed up beautifully as \"...cinematic gold...\" Rates: 5/5\n",

      "..I'm lost for words. This film was not high on my list of \"must-see's\" and I was talked into going by my friend. Boy am i glad he did. I've been so moved and affected by this film I've done nothing but sing it's praises to everyone I talk to. Absolutely amazing...what more can i say? Neither of the lead actors are particular favourites of mine, particularly Kate Winslet who I usually find very annoying and overly \"English\"! But in this role she has completely won me over, and if her and Carrey are not nominated in next years Oscars there is no justice in this world. Carrey was also phenomenal - the gurning clown of past films was replaced with a moving, sensitive portrayal of lost love and loneliness. Already this film has entered my all time top 5 - no mean feat i assure you!\n",

      "'Adaptation' gave us a bird's eye (minds eye?) view of Charlie Kaufman's story problems - finishing in a flurry of madness, ill-defined (though entertaining) narrative and nonsensical twists.  The lesson of third-act panic personified by Cage's character has already been displayed in all previous ventures; 'Human Nature', 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', even 'Being John Malcovich' finishes on a crawl.  Kaufman, it would appear, cannot finish strongly.  Until now, that is.  The movie to silence all doubters, 'Eternal Sunshine.' succeeds on levels that Kaufman's other ventures have not - the connection you feel with each character not being the least of these achievements.  The characterisation and actual acting bring life and soul to an already excellent screenplay, and all in all 'Eternal Sunshine.' gives a more comprehensive view of human relationships and love than any other movie.  Ever.  Broad statement this may be, but think about 'Annie Hall', 'When Harry met Sally' or 'Say Anything' (it slipped in).they all profess to give us a beginning to end study, but only Eternal Sunshine gives us an end to a beginning followed by an end to a beginning.  The reverse pattern with quirky (technically excellent) editing and montage clipping (take a bow Mssr. Gondry) give us an astounding insight into the main characters.  We get to hate them as they hate each other at the end of the relationship, and then we are privy to their slow, backward dance to love and happiness through Joel's (Jim Carrey) mind.The awkwardness of youth, embarrassments of childhood and the introspection of adult life are explored in depth throughout the film, charting the fall and rise (and fall again) of Joel's love life.  Kate Winslet is at her un-Titanic best, appearing likeable and quirk-ridden as well as fallible and narcissistic.   Showing a previously unseen side to herself, she replaces Merchant Ivory's corset heaving and Titanic's crocodile tears with real passion and power - giving Clementine faucets of personality that Kaufman himself probably hadn't yet visualised.  Coaxed by Gondry's sensitive and quizzically probing direction, both actors embody the physical tics, the personable quirks and the likeable traits of each character, giving them flesh and soul beyond expectation.  Reiterating a constant refrain, it must be said again that Jim Carrey is a fine actor!  Constantly an issue up for debate, he now inhabits a man, Joel, who is actually described as 'tight lipped' and is depression-prone, hysterical, boring and human.  Carrey gives him life and will, silencing all doubters with this display of fine thespian fervour.  The movie seems to suit even his face - weather worn and even hangdog, reminiscent of Bill Murray, Carrey dispels with all 'rubber-faced' tags, and puts in a performance to be proud of.Gondry's intensive and pro-active editing, mixed with his camera motion and music choice, forms an equal match to Kaufman's foil than even Spike Jonze managed (lending credence to a script that may otherwise have fallen into the trap of 'Adaptation' or, indeed, Gondry's own 'Human Nature' - that of lack of audience connection or sympathy).  Kaufman's stellar rise has brought subsequent resting on script-laurels, and this fault is rectified by Gondry's light touch and obvious affiliation with actors.  His singular use of camera, honed from years of music video's and short film, offers insight and caress to the individual problems and trials Kaufman so expertly describes.Gondry was the original story man - coming up with the idea of a man discovering his recent love has erased him from her memory, only to erase her in retaliation.  The actual mind erasure, along with the peripheral characters of Dunst, Ruffalo, Wilkinson and Wood (who play out a night of intense proportion in Joel's bedroom around his sleeping body), are incidental to the true story at the base of this fight for memories - love found, love lost, and love sought.  A common theme uncommonly told, this is Kaufman's most commercial film to date.  Those unfamiliar with Kaufman's style may still find this a slog of sorts, and those familiar may smirk at the many traits of 'Adaptation', but both mindsets should appreciate the level of storytelling on display, and the home truths it draws the audience to.  Allowing you to choose a character, and sympathise with them, it then dashes all your expectations without denting your appreciation.  It makes you smile, it makes you laugh, and it makes you sad.  In short, the movie connects.\n",

      "Probably the best American film since \"Fight Club\". Kaufman is a genius, and along with David Fincher he has to be one of the most original and creative people working in mainstream American cinema today. This has to be his masterpiece.Contrary to what some other reviewers feel, I believe that this is a VERY deep movie, and very disturbing in many ways. By the time the credits were rolling I found myself saying out loud \"This is probably the most intelligent American movie I've ever seen.\" and that's not something I usually think after seeing a mainstream Hollywood feature.I'm not at all scared by horror or thriller movies, but I literally had nightmares after watching this. Maybe I was more open to its message, having just lost a parent, but I found the way it approached its major themes -- love, memory, identity and loss, the power of science -- incredibly moving and deeply affecting, and yet it was so brilliantly handled, structurally dazzling, full of mordant humour, and moved along at such a cracking pace that the whole film felt about 1/2-hour long to me. It's also -- despite what others have said -- a tour-de-force example of how CGI can be used well -- to create some profoundly unsettling visual imagery, very Freudian in parts -- a veritable blitzkrieg of surreal images, yet I never felt that (a la Star Wars) it was just technophilia.\n",
      "Some of the scenes had truly chilling overtones -- the \"winking out\" of the people in the scene in the concourse at Grand Central Station; the fading covers of the books, Lacuna's systematic removal of all physical traces of the people being erased; the sinister banality of the staff, \"just doing their job\" -- and not very well at that -- as they go about the task of erasing people's memories. If Lacuna doesn't remind you of all those poor Russians who were rendered \"non persons\" by the KGB's patient, mundane, bureaucracy I think you're missing something.I cannot recommend this film too highly and I firmly believe it will come to be regarded as one of the best American films ever made.\n",

      "It says a lot about this movie that Jim Carrey was the best thing in it. Usually I find him unwatchable but he's really good in this film.Unfortunately the rest of it is a bit disappointing for fans of Charlie Kaufmann's previous work. It's too disjointed and makes the same points again and again and Kate Winslet's character is so irritating! Talk about role reversal. People walked out of the screening I was in. It's not all bad - there's some wonderful dialogue and it's not dire, just not great. Can't believe it has such a high rating and can only imagine it's a hangover from Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, both of which were so innovative and clever.\n",
      "1522\n",
      "I've always had a bit of a soft spot for off-beat movies and this is a classic of its type. This is very much in the mould of Being John Malkovich and I believe it was written by the same guy.SPOILERS WARNING! I had no idea of the story before seeing the film. Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) share an unlikely relationship with Joel being very shy and Clementine very outgoing. Clementine decides she wants to move on and elects to go through a procedure which will erase Joel from her memory. Joel is devastated and decides to have the same procedure, but does he really want to forget Clementine. SPOILERS OVER.The film is thought provoking and nicely played by both the leads. Easily the best film I have seen in 2004 so far and what a shame some of the blockbusters don't try some of the boldness that makes this film extremely good. 9/10\n",

      "Before I comment on the film itself, let me say this:SOMEONE WAKE UP MARK RUFFALO, THE CAMERA IS ROLLING!(I've sat thru so many of this guy's sleepwalk/mumble performances I'm almost as sick of him as that stubbly dwarf Colin Farrell. Have an espresso, Mark!)If you never got over dabbling with hallucinogenics, if you thought the film version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was too conventional, then ESOTSM is your movie! It's a 21st Century light show for people who long for the 60's. Let everyone else beware, however. The movie is mostly downbeat and relentlessly grungy (Carrey is scruffy personified, Winslet looks like a punk peacock) while the director and writer take non-linear narrative to new heights of confusion. Since everyone knows the plotline I won't regurgitate it. But, and let the buyer beware once again, the story shifts are so convoluted that at about the 45 minute mark--and continuing until the last 15 minutes, it's painfully, painfully obvious that the writer and director have completely lost control of the film. So what you get for over an hour is special effects, trick photography, confused symbolism and Kirsten Dunst jumping up and down on a bed. If that's enough to float your boat, time your drugs so you peak about 40 minutes in--and enjoy the movie.\n",
      "1524\n",
      "In ESOTSM, part of the reason you don't find the urgency in Carrey's character's mind is that his character isn't at all an urgent person. He's a self-deprecated man, someone used to losing but tired more of the constant hurting and loss than the struggle to avoid it - hence one of his most painful lines - the delivery of the \"wait! just wait!\" scene in the hallway...Even there, at the most emotionally and decisively urgent moment in his life, his character still fails to deliver the sort of splendor most other hollywood romance films would have overdone, much to the delight of pop-and-teen audiences.It's because of that that he seemingly slides through his mind, through his memories, and never finds anything overwhelmingly stressful - even in the kitchen scene where he's remembering being four, his emotional subcontext is how much he just wants to be picked up - again feeling unneeded and discarded, but still a part of things, but not throwing a tantrum - no urgency.It's this sort of unsteady glide, that painful grate against the simple flow of time and life, that his character is reacting against through the whole film - the breakout is his unconscious trying, trying, trying to do more than just accept and fade - and the stunning concept that most miss is that CLEM, of all people, saves HIM.  She implants in his mind the idea of \"Meet me in Montauk,\" hence the one we'd expect to need saving for all her disgraces actually becomes the stronger of the two - the savior of both of them.I loved this movie and can't wait to see it again.Mike :)\n",

      "Some people I work with said I should go and see this. Usually, they get my taste in films spot-on, and this was no exception. I really enjoyed this.ESotSM is weird. Suspend your disbelief and immerse yourself in it, because you're certainly not going to get a more original storyline again in a hurry, nor are you likely to see a better film. It was almost so strange as to be perfectly believable. The idea of a world where you can go and erase painful memories, where there's even a limit on how many procedures you can have in a month, is funny, but also disturbing.I wasn't comfortable watching this. I did feel like the idea of such a procedure was taking way too many liberties. There are just some things that we're not meant to do. Imagine hearing that someone has erased you from their memory, *shudder*. But the fact that Carrey's character Joel explores the disadvantages of that and tries to reverse the effects, though unsuccessfully, is compelling.The acting was great, especially Carrey, who is so much better in serious roles. I've never liked that madcap face pulling he does and I hardly remembered it was him as I was watching this. He was so understated, excellent.And, Patrick was the perfect role for Elijah Wood after LoTR. His obsession with Clem and stealing Joel's memories was almost perverse. How sleazy can you get? It made me completely forget his portrayal of the good-intentioned Frodo.Kirsten Dunst as the almost tragic Mary was also excellent. I felt so sorry for her having her memories violated in that way, when all she had done was fall in love. Dunst is definitely a young actress to watch out for.I really hope this movie does well. Despite the fact that its subject matter is quite grim and you can't really say that it ends happily, it has, somehow, warmed my heart. It's clever and compelling and it will be really interesting to see what happens come awards time...\n",

      "This movie breaks your heart and inspires your soul. The only downside is the that the scenes of the memory erasing team in Jim Carrey's bedroom are too long. There is one great performer in the movie (Carrey) and another super great performer in the movie (Winslett). The rest of the cast is a bit weak by comparison and the movie drags a little when the average performers (like Dunst and Wood) hold the screen for long sequences. Wood was really distracting because I kept laughing to myself that Frodo had gone bad. But all in all, this movie was extremely entertaining.The cliche \"makes you laugh and makes you cry\" fits this movie better than OJ's glove.\n",

      "I really liked the idea of the film, the cast were all very good and i really hope Jim Carrey continues to do more films like it. The problem was i found the film sort of hinted at the depths it could have gone into but actually didn't explore any concept fully. That is really annoying! The film gave me loads to think about but it wasn't down to clever presentation or ideas it was heavily on suggestion, the characters really lacked dimension and background which is a shame because that would have made the film a lot richer.Anyway i'd recommend seeing the film strongly but you may come out of it being frustrated by the missed opportunities.\n",

      "First of all this movie is through and through Kaufmann and as always he has created a surreal world were reality, dreams, fantasies and memories all mesh into a bizarr worldwind.I loved this movie. The actors are all good in their roles, especially Winslet& Carrey, who oddly enough have a great chemistry, as two diametrically opposed characters. Even the supporting cast with Wood, Dunst and Ruffalo do a noteworthy job.But the aspects that got to me the most was the way the story was told in a mementoesque style and the stunning visuals achieved by great lighting and camera work.Definitively a must see movie of 2004!If you like different and artsy cinema, you won't be disappointed.10/10\n",
      "1529\n",
      "I've been looking forward to the release of this film for some time. Although the cinema trailers prepared me for the basic concepts, I have to say the structure of the movie took me slightly by surprise.  The idea of your lead characters spending most of the movie in one of their heads is intriguing, and it's hard to think of anyone other than Charlie Kaufman who could have pulled it off.So let's start from the beginning.  We witness what appears to be Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine's (Kate Winslet) first meeting, which all goes very well.  Then, as we're settling into the movie, the opening titles finally play and we're into their break-up.  The concept of Lacuna Inc is introduced ¬ñ it transpires that their science-fiction tinged services have allowed Clementine to completely erase Joel from her memories.  Pained by this, Joel agrees to undergo the procedure too.  This occurs at his flat that night. As he sleeps, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood plug him into their machine and begin to delete.  The only trouble is, trapped in his own unconscious, Joel has changed his mind, and is desperately trying to keep hold of Clementine in whatever way he can.Although the attention-grabbing bit of this movie takes place in Jim Carrey's head, there are nice moments beyond it too.  The Lacuna team are well-represented, and the sheer moral discomfort we get from seeing Dunst and Ruffalo frolic in their undies around Carrey's corpse-like form heightens Kaufman's dark vision.  Dunst, in particular, is very good, and it's always nice to see Tom Wilkinson in a film.  More curious is Elijah Wood, completing the foursome.  It's good to report that, after all this time, it didn't seem odd to see Frodo as a human, but one has to wonder why he took the part as he has very little to do.  Nonetheless, the moments he does have are very nice, and more or less set him up as the unexpected villain of the piece.So to the stars.  Everyone's been enthusing about Kate Winslet's performance.  She is good, and I don't think I've seen this character from her before, but then I always knew she was a good actress.  Jim Carrey, however, makes the film his own.  You know how every role he does is more or less a riff on the Carrey/Ventura persona?  How, even in Truman Show, his `good afternoon, good evening and good night' schtick is still there?  Well, it's not here.  There is nothing of Carrey the wacky comedian in here.  This is surely the performance of his career, and probably my favourite performance of the year so far.I really liked Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  I can't help but feel that the central concept isn't fully explored ¬ñ does no-one think that people might want to erase memories not connected with bad love affairs? This doesn't matter, so long as you take it as another in the chain of high-concept magic realism love stories that have been sprinkling smiled into our multiplexes over the past few years.  Michael Gondry's direction, though showy, is slightly less flashy than Spike Jonze's in Being John Malkovich, and all the better for it.  On this evidence, Kaufman is likely to remain the most important writer in America for the foreseeable future.8/10\n",
      "1530\n",
      "Caught this last night and was hugely impressed. French videodirector Gondry brings Kaufman's typically unusual and inventivescript to life using a dazzling array of visual techniques, clever setsand artfully employed special effects. At its heart it's a downbeatlove story between shy introvert Joel (Carrey) and lovely butshallow Clementine (Winslet). When Clemmie leaves him after anargument, Joel learns that she's had every memory of theirrelationship erased using a revolutionary new process. Deeplyhurt he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik(Tom Wilkinson) and demands to undergo the same procedure.However, as Mierzwaik and his oddball team, Stan (Ruffalo), Mary(Dunst) and Patrick (Wood) begin erasing all traces of Clemmiefrom his mind, Joel suddenly decides he doesn't want to forget herafter all...This is really an exceptional piece of work, intelligent, funny andconsistently surprising. While the screenplay centers on therelationship between Joel and Clemmie, Kaufman does anadmirable job of giving each of the secondary characters depthand balancing the action between Joel's desparate fight inside hisown head and the expanding drama taking place outside.\n",
      "Mention must be made of the extraordinary and at times disturbingimagery employed during the latter half of the film, as Joel's fight tosave memories of Clemmie. This film is the best example I've everseen of how special effects can be used to enhance and deepenthe story rather than distract from it. Cornering his 'remembered'Clemmie in a bookshop Joel struggles to convince her to comewith him - symbolically rescuing his memory of her from theerasing process - and as they argue the covers of all the booksaround them become blank. Later, chasing her through a beachhouse they visited when they first met, walls and ceilings dissolvearound them and the sea rushes around their feet. Unforgettable.Performances are uniformly excellent. Again, although the dramacenters mainly on Winslet and Carrey's characters, it's a testamentto the integrity of the screenplay and the quality of the acting thatthe film feels more like an ensemble piece. I had the sense thateveryone working on this film knew it was special and loved doingit.Overall, this is the most exciting new film I've seen since 'FightClub'. Along with 'Zatoichi' it's my pick for film of the year. See it!\n",
      "1531\n",
      "This is a breath-taking film that requires the full concentration of the audience, but pays off with some truly stunning visuals. A brilliantly original script, handled excellently by Gondry. Winslet and Carrey are both wonderful in their roles as estranged lovers seeking a fresh start through memory erasure. Carrey especially seems to exude a sense of helplessness that makes him both fascinating and likable and yet in the same breath too vulnerable to like. This film shows a very modern take on romance and is well worth seeing.\n",

      "Roger Ebert's review (excellent) calls this type of film \"Cinema Maze\" -- something that needs to be figured out, solved, to find one's way out. Very apt.  While it's fun to see this movie once, it's even more fun and worthwhile to see it twice. On a second view, I was astounded to find that I'd completely blanked out several minutes near the end, maybe a result of diverting my focus to process what I'd been seeing?I was attracted to this film because Charlie Kauffman (\"Being John Malkovitch,\" \"Adaptation\") wrote the screenplay.Kauffman has a gift for distorting reality somewhat like Escher, in art, or constructing a M√∂bius strip (the 3D geometric figure that has only one surface and one edge) in such a way that he turns inside out our usual sense of logic and the way things are.  But in doing so in this film, Kauffman reveals more deeply how they really are. In \"Eternal Sunshine,\" he does it with human memory and pain, attraction, commitment and disappointment, and love.  (There are even a few side trips that illumine ethical snares in helper-helpee relations -- something those who stay on the ethical side in doctor-patient type relationships will enjoy.)Don't see it if you do NOT like being challenged by a film. But don't miss it if you enjoy being encouraged to think -- not only on how the film's pieces fit together but about relationships. In that way, it's a bit like \"Swimming Pool\" but more upbeat and poignant.Some say this is Carey's best work and perhaps it is. But Winslet's role is probably the film's axle -- and the support by Wilkerson plus the others in lesser roles is superb.The title comes from line 209 of the poem \"Eloisa to Abelard.\"Take one dose, then repeat 3 days to one week later, and enjoy!\n",

      "This film is a fantastic tale of love and friendship, beautifully structured to show the realism that love is not always perfect, but can exist 'warts and all'.  It is a unique story of love that shows the flaws in a relationship, which are inevitable in a realistic world.  It is a refreshing story that holds strength in its originality.The film is written by, the talented Charlie Kaufman, (Being John Malkovich) who superbly tells the story of the relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet).  The couple fall in love after a chance encounter on a beach, but things soon turn sour as they discover each others flaws, which leads Clementine to take drastic measures to medically erase all the memories she has of Joel.  When Joel discovers this, he too undergoes the same process, and the film follows his battle to let go of his feelings for Clementine.  The story is enchanting and captivating, as it delves into Joel's mind, which frantically tries to hide Clementine into areas of his mind that doctors cannot erase.  The plot certainly seems far-fetched, but it is a refreshing and original piece of film, which seems to possess a magical quality that keeps you glued to the screen.The original composition of the shots gives the film a hidden depth of imagination.  At one point we see Joel and Clementine lying in bed, on a beach, surrounded by snow.  It is a beautifully structured scene that has a dream-like quality that makes the cinematography so powerful.Jim Carrey gives yet another great performance, following his successful hit, Bruce Almighty.  Eternal Sunshine proves he has the ability to convey a credible character that does not focus on his comical capabilities.  The intensity of his emotions for Clementine is clearly expressed by Carrey's captivating presence on screen.  He dominates almost every scene, almost overshadowing other great talents, such as Kate Winslet.  Winslet does give a convincing performance, portraying an unusual and quirky character.  Her ever-changing hair colour adds to her unique persona.  The combination of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet seems to work very well on screen.  They manage to show conviction of emotion that ensures the audience warms to the characters.  The appearance of Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson adds to this films strong cast and do not fail to impress the audience.The plot at times is complex, and perhaps is a film that is better appreciated the second time.  The structure of the film does not follow a chronological order adding to the films uniqueness.I thought this film was a breath of fresh air from the usual teen horror or American comedies we are so used to on our cinema screens.  It combined a magical dreamlike quality with the harsh realities that doom a relationship. The love story between the two characters is captivating as we are drawn into Joel's mind, allowing us to see his internal battle with his feelings for Clementine. ¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠\n",

It might have just been the light-hearted `Mr. Blue Sky' playing or I might have thought the actual trailer looked good. I still don't know. What ever it was, was a thought that spawned from the side of my brain that I'd like to thank.Eternal Sunshine was downright incredible. Every aspect was just incredible. The flawless editing, the unique directing, the acting; all great!I'm almost ashamed to admit that this was the first work of director Michel Gondry that I had seen. His style was mind-blowing and very appropriate for the film. After my viewing of Eternal Sunshine, I immediately ran to purchase The Work of Michel Gondry on DVD, which, by the way, I highly recommend. Though Gondry's directing didn't fit with Charlie Kaufman's writing as well as Spike Jonze's directing, Gondry's still worked incredibly well.Being a fan of Being John Malkovich, and Adaptation, I was even happier after watching the trailer to see that Kaufman was the writer. Kaufman's work in Eternal Sunshine could be described as his best, which is what I choose to do. The dialogue is brilliant, the locals are brilliant and the overall feel of the screenplay is brilliant. A fan of Kaufman's style will undoubtedly love this film.What really surprised me was the quality of Jim Carrey's performance and his chemistry with Kate Winslet. Not since the under appreciated Truman Show, has Carrey given such a realistically grand performance. His chemistry with the chameleon-haired Winslet alone is worth seeing the film. Her acting was astounding, as was Dunst's, Ruffalo's and Wilkinson's. Though, If I had to name one thing about the film, it would be Elijah Wood's careless acting. I felt it could have been much better, but it still doesn't take away from the overall acting score. _______________________________________________________________________So, what's the story?Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) have their memories erased when their relationship becomes less than perfect. As the procedure takes place, Joel realizes how much he really treasures his relationship with Clementine._______________________________________________________________________So, Who should see it?Well, Eternal Sunshine would be the perfect date movie, but don't take a film enthusiast to it on a date. They will be far too involved in the story ?I do not recommend this movie for young children. They will probably become overly bored and gain nothing from the experience.If you fit into the quiet late teen-aged, middle aged adult or film enthusiast crowd, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a must see. ______________________________________________________________________My Rating.

      "Was this film really worth watching?  I thought I would give it a chance as a) Jim Carrey was in it, but more importantly b) Charlie Kaufman wrote it, whom after Adaption really set my hopes up high.  The film definitely starts on a high note, the mundanity of Joel's life is shown to us in full and there is some a really interesting exchange on a train between Joel and Clementine.  Then after 20 minutes, you realise there has been no opening credits and thus we are thrown into the story, with Joel sobbing his heart out over Clementine's infidelity.  Then comes the boring part.  We realise that she has had something to do with removing the memories of poor Joel from her mind.  But Kaufman forgot one thing, and that was to tell us HOW LONG they had actually been together.  Then for some reason Joel gets the memory erasing thingymajig treatment, cue HUGELY overlong scenes of Joel and Clementine talking inside Joel's mind in different scenario's where the weird and wonderful (sometimes) happen.  I thought these would last only 10 minutes, but they actually take up the majority of the film.  My main problem was that nothing made sense, but after seeing many many films I decided that the convention of cinema dictates that when you're watching a film where crazy things are happening they are always tied up in a neat fashion at the end which makes you think \"...oh yeah!\".  However, Eternal Sunshine's ending tried to do this but as all of these things were happening, I got completely lost and I was paying very close attention.  The end of the film just made me think \"what the hell?\" and will require another couple of viewings to get my head around completely.  Also, Mr Carrey isn't given the chance to flex his facial muscles as much as before.  I thought he had gone serious when I saw Trueman Show, and The Majestic confirmed it but last year's insanely enjoyable Bruce Almighty made me think he could do both.  I was disappointed that the comedy was removed from his role and the funniest thing in the film was Clementine's worrying habit of dressing up potatoes (you will see for yourself).  Overall, Charlie Kaufman has given us an intriguing story and the suggestion that we should just keep bad memories inside us as it builds character and lets us remember for future purposes. Unfortunately it isn't really applied to this film, and definitely left me feeling very cold and unfulfilled.Get it on video so you can rewind and see it again to understand it, but it's not worth going to the cinema because you can't ask the projectionist to show you it again to understand what happened.2 out of 5 Hattori Hanzo blades.\n",

      "It's so rare these days to go to the cinema and see a truly touching film, or even an original film, since so much of the films released these days are so formulaic. As far as romances go, most films nowadays seem to follow the same pattern. So it was unbelievably refreshing to see a film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.I wanted to watch this film as I knew it had been written by Charlie Kaufman, and I enjoyed two of his earlier films Adaptation and Being John Malkovich. The unusual combination of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet also intrigued me. I think that when you watch a good film, every frame seems to fit exactly in place and that's what this film was like for me. There are many films that play with memory, but this does so successfully while maintaining the premise of the romantic comedy. I found it clever how Michel Gondry played with continuity editing as Joel's memories were being erased and, the ending also impressed me as it resolved the plot points successfully while leaving some things uncertain. I have a whole new respect for Jim Carrey after seeing this film. Kate Winslet was also brilliant. Hopefully the Academy will remember this film next year, as it deserves at least a nomination for Best Picture.To me this film is as wonderful as The Shawshank Redemption (my favourite film of all time) so I would give it, without hesitation, 10/10\n",

      "This is a sad movie about love, loneliness and despair. It is loneliness and eagerness to be loved that make the characters (and all the people in the world, I think) do the things they do. I went to see `Eternal Sunshine...' with my mom. She liked the movie - it impressed her a lot. When we left the cinema she was very pensive and silent. She said that the movie was too sad for such a nice morning, but nevertheless she loved it. As for me - I liked Jim Carrey's performance very much. I adore his funny characters such as Ace Ventura and I think he's the best comic actor I've ever seen, but I rate his dramatic heroes highly as well. To my mind, he's the actor who can play the part of any character he likes. I liked Kate Winslet's acting, but I didn't like her character - she's a person of such kind that annoys me greatly. Unfortunately, Elijah Wood disappointed me. He looks like a guy who can only open his eyes wide and be a loser. I used to like him, but his latest works upset me. In general, the movie was worth watching, but I'm not sure I'll have a desire to watch it again someday. 9 out of 10.\n",

      "Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet star in this bizarre love story which is more or less told in reverse.  Imagine a rather surreal love story version of Memento you'll get the idea.  After Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) have an unsuccessful romance, they decide to undergo a radical medical procedure to erase each other from their memories.  However, as Joel has the process done, he finds he wants to keep some of his memories after all, and tries to hide them at deep subconscious levels.For every person I've met who liked this film I met someone who hated it.  I belong in the former category.  Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is amusing, melancholic and clever.  Michel Gondry directs with flair, and Carrey is as good here as he was in The Truman Show, playing against type.  There is also fine support from Winslet, Kirstin Dunst and Tom Wilkinson who is at the centre of an unexpected and interesting subplot I won't spoil here.The only thing I didn't like was the regulation f-ing and blinding which despite being realistic, somewhat soured it for me.  That said, this is recommended for anyone on the lookout for something a little different, and a welcome antidote to the annual deluge of rubbish romantic comedies with neither romance nor comedy.\n",

      "The idiosyncratic pen of Charlie Kaufman, who brought us the quirky and inventive Being John Malkovitch, has excelled himself in this offering with a movie that not only boasts originality of plot but a tender love story that avoids all excesses of sentimentality with razor-edge script and magnetic performances from Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey. At the end of an unusual and loving relationship with Carrey, Winslet's character answers an ad to have the (now painful) memory 'erased'. Carrey, dumfounded, follows suit, only to become resistant half-way through the process. What sounds like a dedicated sci-fi story is presented in such a way as to be perfectly ordinary and acceptable to a mainstream audience, allowing us to focus on the real dynamics of relationships and memories rather than get caught up in some high tech idea. Lacuna, the company that does the 'erasing', is headed by Tom Wilkinson - a very homely type who has hit on a process that combines psychology with zapping pinpointed areas of the brain in a sort of limited intentional brain damage exercise. A love story this unusual that also flows like original poetry is a sufficiently unique event to entrance most cinema goers.\n",

      "*small spoilers*if you like the confusing, not quiet sure whats happening factor of films such as Donnie Darko this films for you.The film centers around Joel (Carrey) who after discovering his girlfriend Clementine (Winslet) has erased him from her memory, attempts to erase all memory of her from his mind, but as his memories begin to disappear he finds himself rediscovering his love for her, leading to a race through his memories in an attempt to hide Clementine and stop her disappearing from his life forever.The film did have quiet a lot of flashbacks from various times in Joel's life which did get confusing sometimes, and it was a bit slow at the beginning.However if you are looking for a film thats fun and a bit different, this could be what your looking for. You may need to see it twice to understand it.The title sums up this film, happy, confusing and brilliant.\n",

      "An unconventional love story that starts out typical, but soon throws you into the chaotic mind of a man trying to erase a former lover. Kate Winslet is sublime, nailing every line, every motion with perfection. You soon forget that this same actress played Rose in Titantic.  Let me tell you... she ain't no rose in this movie. Right away Clementine draws you in.  You can't take your eyes off of her. She's emotional, talkative, absurd even.  But you love her, even when she's mean. And if you're expecting the usual Jim Carrey movie, then you will be pleasantly disappointed.  It's a different kind of romantic comedy.  One that reminds me of Punch Drunk Love.  At first you think, \"Oh no, another comedian trying to appear deep.\"  But in both movies you are blown away by their performances and realize there's much more to these comedians than a few funny jokes. A couple of times I wasn't sure if I was even supposed to be laughing.  It seems as though laughter doesn't fit. Kaufman, who if you've seen any of his other movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), know how eccentric and radically creative he is, tones it down a bit, with a plot that's slightly more realistic.  He taps into the personal, emotional side of people.  Spotlighting the love/hate relationships that can drive a person crazy. I strongly suggest that everyone at least gives this movie a chance, because it's one that keeps you thinking and makes you walk away with a smile.\n",

      "This is an interesting film that in the context of a story about love and loss is able to comment on the psychology of memory, relationships and identity.  While perhaps not immediately thought of as a Science Fiction movie, the writer and director are able to derive a technique from that genre and successfully weave film-making and storytelling techniques in a fashion to allow the audience a clear perspective of the queer workings of the characters' memories as they fade.  The dream-like, stream of conscious feeling the film creates provides the viewer with an almost hypnotic suspension of belief.  Unlike moments in screenwriter Kaufman's earlier works where his unique storytelling devices can feel like tricks for the sake of being clever, his manipulation becomes integral to the story's telling and enables the film and the audience a view on the challenges of memory and our own tenuous relationship with it.  Considering the screenwriter's previous work in Adaptation, where he places himself in the film as a character and voices various philosophical criticisms about the process of writing and producing satisfying films in modern Hollywood, I can't help but think that he's overcome some of his own challenges in creating a well-told \"love story\" without resorting to clique.\n",

      "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is a film of genius. I rarely enjoy relationship films, they make me squirm.  But this is a truly wonderful terrifying film and maybe for me a life changing film. The film forced out of me emotions which I had been hiding for years.  Anyone who has been in a relationship which had broken down will understand the main protagonists in the film.  Both Jim Carrey's and Kate Winslet's performances are wonderful. They are given very hard jobs to do by the script which has brought out the best in them.  I have not been a huge fan of Charlie Kaufmans films in the past.  I am not saying that I do not believe that they are good but they have never before klicked with me.  This film changes all that, the writing is grown up and treats the voyeur as a adult, which is rare in Hollywood. It also makes you want to see both charactors come together at the end of the film and you feel for them as the story follows its course.  I left the film feeling empty, whilst also feeling full of emotion of happiness for memories I have and sadness for what I have not done since because of them.\n",

It's something you either feel or you don't I suppose, and I imagine it certainly helps to have loved and lost personally, but if you do... WOW.  It's the most incredible testament to love and the beauty of new beginnings I've ever seen.  I sat in the theater, after having cried at the sheer beauty of the film's message and feeling, unable to move.  I couldn't do anything but sit in absolute awe of this, now probably my favorite, movie, and try to soak it in.  #45 might not even be fair, in my opinion.\n",

      "A dazzling array of editing technique's and camerawork alongside Jim Carrey at his most refined and Kate Winslet at simply her best combine to create a wonderful little film from the writer of 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind'. Despite the high regard in which I hold the previously mentioned two films I was still a little worried by ESSM thanks to an unhelpful advertising campaign that has obviously thought - Carrey + serious role + weird concept = 'Truman Show 2' and subsequently played to that film's fans. It is an understandable ploy as the film is actually more like a cross between 'Lost in Translation' and 'Being John Malkovich' - not exactly something to pack in the average collection of 'rude boys' who tend to assemble outside my local (Aylesbury)cinema even if it would draw it more favourably to the attention of the independent film fans. The film buzzes through lovable prologue, confused first act, even more confusing and weird complication in the second and then, surprisingly for Kaufman, a wonderful third act which gives us resolution and shows a mastery of non-linear narrative within the fantasy genre. Fantasy, I hear you cry? Well don't worry its not your Oscar-stealing 'Lord of the Rings' / Brad Pitt in skimpy old school clothing faire (yes I'm already dreading being dragged to see 'Troy' by overzealous females who I fantasise about bedding) instead the more stylish modern conceptual fantasies - the basic premise is the ability to erase memories of people. Carrey is solid and impressive but Winslet is even more so (though I still believe the show is stolen by one of Carrey's friends who's two or so lines are fantastic including his stoned excuse for not helping his wife - 'I'm making a birdcage'). A well directed independent film which will hopefully do a little bit at the box office thanks to Carrey fans who travel expecting to see Mr. Ventura contorting his face for kicks. You never know they may leave the cinema as happy as I did.9/10 one of the best of the year so far.\n",

But do not let this put you off watching this amazing film, especially if you just lost the love of your life and do not imagine living again without them. Kate Winslet gives an amazing performance as Clementine too, with her ever changing hair colours. The film gets quite weird at parts, especially in the parts where Carrey starts to get his mind erased. The ending was quite disappointing (no I will not tell you the ending), but the film itself was a great joy to watch from start to finish. I would rate this film from 1 to 10 as a 9 (just for Winslets ever changing hair colours!).\n",

The technique of filming is 'new wave' stlylistic and actually makes you use your brain. It is so clever the way they have filmed it, a lot of research must have gone into about how the mind actually does store memory as the film seems to mimic this.

      "The title ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' comes from a poem by Alexander Pope quoted by Kristen Dunst in the film and has the same preocupations that the film has (love, loss and memory). The film appears to be an adaptation of that poem translated to the screen by writer Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry. Leads Carrey and Winslet are both perfect as the once in love couple whose desire to forget is so powerful they decide to have their memories erased, while the supporting cast (especially Elijah Wood as the scheming Patrick) are Oscar worthy, as is the screenplay and definatly the direction, visually complex and original, although one thing puzzles me, what does Joel do for a living and how is it he never seems to be at work? He is said to be a graphic designer but how do we find out?  Best Scene; Stan (Mark Rufflo) and Mary (Kristen Dunst) lying on the comatosed Joel stoned and talking about The Clash. On leaving the cinema, it made me want to do the same thing.\n",

      "Jim Carrey doing serious films always did seem crazy. The Truman show and Man on the moon was good, wish you could say the same with The Majestic. But here he stars in a very good comedy drama that's more drama.In some senses, this is similar to Minority Report. A new technology that that seems to make the world a better place but actually makes it worse. But unlike Minority Report, Eternal Sunshine doesn't go through scene by scene, it continously switches between small scenes. The beginning is simple enough but then it'll get confusing but gradually makes a bit more sense. So not a film for people who just want a simple drama.Jim Carrey does an impressive-enough performance but I find that quite a mostly serious performance was ruined when in 2 scenes, he acted like a kid, going back to zany comedy Jim Carrey. Kate Winslet does a good performance too with an impressive American accent. And some good support from Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood (after Lord of the rings, you would have though he'll go for a bigger part.)The story will keep you going along with the other story that develops between the staff of the memory-erasing clinic. So if you fancy a strange drama with twists and turns, go ahead with this. But if you love Jim Carrey in his comedy films, don't go for this.\n",

      "This movie has a complex structure and an interesting plot gimmick.  That's good in and of itself, but they serve a larger purpose as well.  The movie isn't really about the gimmick, but what people feel about each other, and why they get together and come apart, and the value that remains when a relationship breaks up.  I also really admired how the bits I thought strained actually made perfect sense once they showed me the rest of the information.  This is the first movie where I recognized the authorial voice.  Only Kaufman could have done this, and I would have known it even if I hadn't read about it.  Carrey does a perfectly good job as a partial loser, and Winslet is captivating as what one critic called an \"annoying flake\".  This couple isn't Romeo and Juliet - they're just folks.  And they don't always appreciate what they have.  I find it interesting that they seem to have a character arc of the sort that Kaufman lampooned in \"Adaptation\" - only this arc is rooted in human nature.  It made perfect sense. \n",

In fact, at its heart, this film is a straight-forward love story - stripped of sentimentality and romance. It's certainly *not* a science-fiction film. The science is incidental. Jim Carey is excellent. He plays an unusual character - quiet, deep - and he does it very well. I was a little disappointed when he reverted to type in some later scenes. Don't be put off by some reviewers who (wrongly) think that this movie is about fate. It's absolutely not.If you're in an long-term relationship thats had its ups-and-downs then go see this movie.

      "Perhaps they do, because, without giving anything away, there are two examples in this film of exactly that. Or am I really referring to lightning striking twice, or history repeating itself...I'm not too sure, and it's sure hard to write a review of this without giving anything away. I have had to watch ESOTSM three times before writing this, because it took me that long to decide if I really liked it, and one viewing, unless you're cleverer than me, does not make total sense of it all. Guess what. I really liked it. Having not seen 'Adaptation' or 'being John Malkovich', I was new to the script-writer, but anything as fresh and original as this will always get my vote. This is almost 'Sliding Doors' meets 'Memento', but it's not anything like either of those films in either style or story, really. But there are some similarities. I was surprised at the size of the audiences because I fully expected the cinema-going masses to give this a miss. This is no ordinary Jim Carrey movie, although I have not seen his previous 'serious' films. This is still amusing, though, in a gentler kind of way. He shines, although is ultimately out-acted by the brilliant Kate Winslet, who is on fantastic form here. She really doesn't make enough movies, and it was great to see her in another great film (I'm counting 'Titanic' and 'Enigma' as the others), especially following the dire 'Life of David Gale'. The supporting cast are good, although Tom Wilkinson is forever etched in my brain now as the 'villain' from 'Girl With A Pearl Earring', in which he was terrific. Finally, in the cast department, a mention for Kirsten Dunst. She injects life into the middle of this movie, just when it almost threatens to peter out slightly. But save it she does. Just how good is ESOTSM? Ask me after I've watched it another 3 times. Justifies its top 50 in the IMDB list, in my view. Not sure beyond that. My one criticism, as I always try to think of one, is that there could perhaps have been more urgency inside Carrey's mind, to increase the tension. But it's not a thriller, so it doesn't matter anyway. Defies categorisation really. But then again all the best films are. ('Donnie Darko' is another case in point.) 8 out of 10 - for now. Not to be missed, that's for sure. Don't kill bill - make a date with Kate.\n",

      "This film blew me away because I simply wasnt expecting it to be what it was. Though I had a feeling it would be something special, I didnt realise I would  be so involved and, by the end, so totally moved! It appears that everything Kauffman touches turns to gold!First and foremost, a wonderful and unusual, eccentric story, that when told to a friend sounds ridiculous, but when watched on the big screen is perfectly feasible. The script was great, you totally believed the dialogue that the characters shared and each character had his/her own individual voice. The imagery was alternately beautiful and horrifying. Featureless faces and memories being raced against before their erasure was a masterstroke! Joel's memories of Clementine and his placing her in different parts of his memory was very clever, and very well done, relying on the visual medium (which made it easier for me to understand hehe).Something that occurred to me after leaving the cinema was that there was evidence of couples within the film that would go on to have the Lacuna treatment. Joel's friends, the couple (one of which was Mel in Frasier I believe?), looked as if they would soon be candidates for the treatment, and the young man who was clearly more into Kirsten Dunst than she was into him also looked as though he'd be a candidate. This I found subtle and clever.The acting was simply flawless. I realised after watching the film that it was probably the first genuinely good film I'd seen Kate Winslet in (who will ever forget Titanic?), and my god she was redeemed for that film! Not only was her accent perfect, she managed to be a character that you liked, but also wanted to shake! And you could tell that the relationship would have worked had they kept their eyes open and not allowed themselves to hate eachother, because the line between love and hate is a very fine one! It is a rare thing to have a believable love between two fictional characters.The star of the show though was Carrey. I find him irritating and embarrassing in his comedic roles (Bruce Almighty I found horrendous) but it appears that he cant do wrong when he stars in carefully chosen dramas. The Truman Show, Man On the Moon and Eternal Sunshine... are all superb films, and he never fails to impress me in his dramatic roles.....I would love to see him in more. And SURELY this year he has to be at least nominated for an Oscar! Who would have thought it, that the 'rubber faced genius' (debatable!) would not only be a good straight actor, but also an Oscar worthy candidate.....that would shake up Hollywood a little I should think!\n",

      "I never expected to give a movie with Jim Carrey in it anything more than mild support, but this is a masterpiece, and Carrey's excellent performance contributes enormously to it. Don't let reviews fool you into thinking that this movie is some kind of cold intellectual game. Not only is it about human vulnerability and the recognition and acceptance of our own imperfections as a starting point to acknowledging those of others. It is also a political movie in the best possible sense, the American pioneer myth of being able to forget the past and start all over again being given an extraordinary twist. Altogether a great work of art, worth seeing again and again and again. Strides ahead of MALKEVICH and ADAPTATION, those excellent movies can be seen as very enjoyable apprentice projects. A moving, compassionate, funny, imaginative, wise and completely enjoyable work. Do not under any circumstances miss it.\n",

      "'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is the latest film from the genius that is Charile Kaufman. Much like 'Being John Malcovich' and 'Adaption' it doesn't easily fit in with any genre definition. IMDB has it listed as a comedy/drama/romance/sci-fi, I'd also add 'fantasy' to that... it hops through the genre's with merry abandonment.ESOTSM is about a couple (Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) who are at the end of their relationship. Carrey's character, Joel, finds out that Winslet's character, Clementine, has had a procedure to erase him from her memories. Joel decides to undergo the same procedure.The film is essentially about relationships. Joel is a complete introvert whereas Clementine is an extrovert. When these two polar opposites are attracted to each other the inevitable happens, the introvert is scared of losing the extrovert to someone \"more interesting\" and the extrovert feels like they can never be themselves. So through a complete lack of communication the relationship breaks down. While undergoing the mind erasing procedure Joel comes to realise this and feels he needs to change things, but first must find a way to stop the erasure process inside the confines of his memories.*SPOILERS AHEAD*A strong supporting cast backs the main themes up, with Kirsten Dunst as a young nurse called Mary. She's in love with her older married boss, and finds out that she was in love with before, but went through the procedure herself. It's a definite attempt to make the viewer realise that even although you can try to erase someone from your memories, your true feeling are still there, you can't erase them.The patients who undergo the treatment have to make an audio tape before the procedure stating their problems with whoever they're erasing. Mary takes these tapes and sends them out to everyone along with a letter explaining what's happened. Joel and Clementine have just 'discovered' each other again when they receive the tapes, and Joel heres all about Clementines faults from himself while she's present, and vice versa.In a way I feel like it's the perfect start to their \"new\" relationship. The two characters know each others bad points (the way the other viewed them at least) at the start of the relationship, and not at the end as per the usual. It got me thinking - maybe if you could get all those issues out in the open at the start of a relationship you could actually get on with the business of enjoying each other. However if you did actually know these things, would you stay or would you go? Both parties would have to hear the tapes at the same time - if the tapes were heard one at a time I think the other would run off, freaked out, believing the other to be a nut. Such is the confinements of social interactions unfortunately.\n",
      "*END OF SPOILERS*Kate Winslet is an absolute joy, she bring Clementine to life. She seems to revel in the part, and I think she gives her best performance to date. As someone said on the imdb boards, we see her at her \"sweetest and hottest\". Carrey is excellent too, proving yet again that his talents go far beyond pulling stupid faces. The supporting cast are all excellent, from Elijiah Wood's panties-stealing Patrick to Mark Rufallo's eccentric Stan. A special mention to Kirsten Dunst for a great performance as Mary, she plays a small but key role in the film, and her mannerisms make the character believable.\n",

Alongside his cinematographer Ellen Kuras and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir (he's Icelandic and this is his first English-language feature) he has created something visually which I wouldn't have thought possible on screen - a perfectly flowing journey through someone's disjointed memories. The trip through Joel's memories is such a large part of the film that I really have a hard time getting my head round how long the sequence must have taken to create. The attention to detail is amazing, and the whole thing seems so real.\n",
      "Kaufmun's script is so sharp it almost cuts you. Gondry co-wrote it with Kaufman, but from a rumour I've heard the only change Gondry actually made was to the ending. Whereas Kaufmun's was a lot darker and ironic, Gondry wanted the film to end in a positive light, but still retain an element of the original. The dialogue is absolutely fantastic. I guess one of the main reasons I loved it so much was that I feel most people could relate to the situations the characters found themselves in as we've all been there at some point in our life. I personally really empathised with Joel, and even some of the things he says sounded like things I've said/though myself in the past \"How is it possible for me to fall in love 100 times a day\" and especially \"talking all the time isn't communicating\".\n",
      "The music is simply amazing, bringing thoughts of 'Lost in Translation' and also Paul Thomas Anderson's films.

      "My rating:  9/10Would individuals and the world be better off if science could invent a way to erase bad memories, such as those of a romantic relationship gone sour? At first thought, the answer might appear to be a quick, unequivocal `yes', but screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and company present a much more complex, considered response in Eternal Sunshine, in the process making some timeless observations on the nature of romantic love and life itself.  For without unpleasant memories, how are people to learn from their mistakes and move forward?  Might they not be doomed to repeat their mistakes, almost verbatim?  And would people be better off learning news of the future, or are we to be thankful that the future is unknowable?Fans of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who loved `Being John Malkovich' and `Adaptation' (the best film of 2002, in my judgment), will no doubt relish Eternal Sunshine.  Kaufman is to be commended for again breaking new ground in filmmaking; while Eternal Sunshine is definitely recognizable as a Kaufman film, he has not yet fallen into a rut, and the material is satisfyingly original.  But Kaufman isn't the only one who deserves kudos for Eternal Sunshine (he also shares writing credits): Jim Carrey is great, Kate Winslet gives a strong performance as Carrey's self-admittedly `high maintenance' love interest, and Kirsten Dunst (incredibly nubile dancing in her underwear during one scene) shows both emotional shallowness (as a worshipful assistant to a doctor and a party girl) and depth, when required.Eternal Sunshine makes excellent use of the medium of film; like Kaufman's other work, it would have to be tremendously transformed to be made into a book or play.  The intent in Eternal Sunshine is to mimic the behavior of the mind by jumping from image to image across boundaries of time and space, not always paying attention to the laws of physics, and combining disparate elements from multiple experiences.  Through striking sets such as a beach house that disintegrates as Carrey's character slowly has the memory of it destroyed, Director Michel Gondry succeeds in crafting powerful images to convey Kaufman's story.Those looking for a film that requires and rewards thought will find much enjoyable brain food in Eternal Sunshine.  It's not quite Kaufman's deepest work, but it most definitely delivers an original moviegoing experience.\n",

      "This quiet gem surprised me immensely. I was not charmed by Adaptation or Being John Malkovich, so I expected to be disappointed. BUT NO!  I was so taken with this movie from the beginning. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barrish, the quiet, esoteric \"nice\" guy. Kate Winslet play Clementine, his spitfire mismatch. Clementine changes her hair color as much as her underwear, while Joel scribbles furiously in his journal. These two opposites somehow find their way to each other, and it just seems right. Things go sour after a few years, and Clementine, wrenched by the heartache, undergoes a procedure to remove Joel from her mind. Brokenhearted and betrayed, Joel attempts the same procedure. While his memories are being erased, however, he has a change of heart. Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind and runs chronologically backwards (like Momento). It's a bit confusing, but it's not as important to be able to figure out the chronology as to recognize the overarching themes of the movie. There is much here to chew on, and Charlie Kaufman throws us one massive bone. Would we be the same person without certain memories? Would we make the same mistakes again? Can we dive into the mind and leave it sacred? Does passion drive us to foolishness?\n",
      "David Cross and Jane Adams are a wonderful addition to the all star cast, rounded out by Kirstin Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, and Murk Ruffalo. These players all delicately but superbly support the story that Carrey and Winslet bring to life with subtlety and charm. 10 out of 10.\n",

      "I love that we live in a decade when something like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't just made but is also a major film release. Apart from having to go to a box office and say that title in order to order a ticket, its where that ticket is being sold - at a large multiplex near you. On top of 21 Grams, its as though Hollywood, looking back at the many years of film history, through German Existentialism, French New Wave and the Easy Riders of the sixties, feels some kind of continued obligation to present something intelligent and experimental in amongst its more traditional fare. Which is a great, great thing. Not that everything within is entirely original. A woman takes the rather rash decision to buy in process in which she has all of the memories of her boyfriend wiped from her mind and in pain and spite he does the same. Deliberate memory loss is a genre stock-in trade - and the appearance of someone in their own head or someone elses rationalizing what is happening is something which has turned up in almost every tv show from Star Trek to Buffy -- hell even the Jennifer Lopez clunker The Cell hung on that very idea. But here it's about execution. And whereas in most other cases its been subservient to some greater plot-arc or subplot, here they're asking the rather bigger questions of why memories are important and how they aid in making us who we are and also how important the people we've met and our collective experiences further our understanding of ourselves.\n",
      "The writer, Charlie Kauffman is probably one of the most exciting writers we have available. Like Rob Shearman, he takes what are relatively unique characters and places them within an extra-ordinary situation, and makes us care for them as they illuminate our own failings. The problem is that I can't imagine a conventional director tackling the material. So it's a good job that Michael Gondry was available. Together with photographer Ellen Kuras (of Personal Velocity) many fantastic images are created - from the bed on the beach to the bookshop in which all the paperbacks suddenly reverse themselves on the shelves, and sets disappearing along with the guys memory. Its that ability to produce the credible within the incredible which has attracts such acting talent, and impressively makes them want to do such extraordinarily good work. This is the Jim Carrey film that its OK to like if you usually hate his stupid mugging face. Kate Winslet proves yet again that she's not all about corsets, producing a perfect extrapolation of the Holly Golightly-style fabulous person we all know (when are they going to pass a law which says that everyone should see every film she's in?) Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst are, well, Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst, it's interesting to see what Elijah Wood has been doing during The Rings and David Cross continues to be 'that guy'. Not a poor performance amongst them.\n",
      "The problem is that despite all that its not a film for everyone. If you're looking for some something linear yet enjoyable you might not have the best time. But if Fight Club crossed with Vanilla Sky with a dash of Waking Life sounds like a good thing to you, you're going to love it.\n",

      "It seems like Hollywood is fascinated with the question of whether things are destined to happen or whether freewill determines our actions. Donnie Darko delved into that issue in a brilliant, but somewhat complex way. In \"Eternal Sunshine\" we are treated to an examination of the stated issue, but in a clear and rather easy to understand way. Joel has had a both wonderful and difficult relationship with Clementine. However, after the fun has ceased to be, Clementine decides to call the whole thing off, actually, she attempts to erase all memories of the relationship. By using a new type of medical procedure, one can remove all memories about something you no longer care to remember. Just think of it, taking your most traumatic memories at getting rid of them forever. Of course, Joel is not aware that Clementine has done this. When heartbroken Joel finds out, he decides that turn about is fair play, so he will cancel his memories of her out. However, as Joel soon discovers, relationships might always end badly, but they were not always bad. Can Joel keep the good times in his memory? If meeting someone is fate, can two people destined for one another really be prevented from meeting or forgotten? I enjoyed this film and although the story might seem complicated, it really is easy to follow. Nice story, great performances and interesting things to think about after you have left the theater. **** out of ****.\n",

There is no artistic effects in this movie which are used just to be clever - it all serves the main theme, which, when you get to the end and hopefully discover it, is very moving.The reason i was untouched by the movie the first time was i got stuck comparing it to Being John Malkovich, which it only resembles in such superficial elements like use of a steadicam. The other reason is I was up the back of the theatre, and i couldn't hear the music well enough, so the music wasn't allowed to draw me into the movie's world, so i felt sort of detached - though, in retrospect, the movie stilled my beating heart for the first two-thirds the first time i saw it.\n",

The writing on this movie is just as surreal as the writers previous hit 'Being John Malkovich' and all things considered, if this movie doesn't get some oscar nods, the academy needs to look again.I have to go back in all my voting and change all my previous 10's to 9's.This movie's rating IMHO is an eleven!This movie just became my favorite movie of all time.If you haven't seen this movie yet, please do so.

      "Charlie Kaufmann is the brightest light in American screenwriting today, period. 'Eternal Sunshine' is not only a great script, it is brilliantly realized. Not only in Michel Gondry's direction, but Vald√≠s √ìskarsd√≥ttir's creative editing give Kaufman's ideas a wonderfully non-linear canvas on which to roam.The best way to see this movie is to know as little about it as possible. Suffice to say that it is an examination of the cost of loving and losing. Is love worth the pain? The hoariest question in romantic comedies, right? Except the answer to that question lies at the end of an astonishingly original landscape of inventions that allow the viewer to look at an old question in new ways.Jim Carey and Kate Winslett are star-crossed opposites: Carey plays the introvert and Winslett the extrovert. It works well. Hopefully Carey will learn that taking all of that energy and compressing it inside a repressed introvert can make a much more interesting and adult character.\n",

First of all, I loved the movie and there's really nothing to add about how great the performances were, etc.  But, I want to explain to those of you who didn't understand that each segment of Joel's memory is in reverse order.  However, the segment itself obviously goes in chronological order for brief periods of time.  This is much like how we remember things in our own mind.  There's probably just a few minutes played out in our mind (or seconds sometimes) that we can recall.  So, these segments of \"memories\" of Joel are being erased, starting with the latest that he remembers of Clementine until he first meets her.  There is no \"jumping around\" in time.  It's strictly in reverse order.  Sorry, I just wanted to clear that up, and I hope it will help you when you see this wonderful film again.  Thanks for listening!\n",

This ploy on the part of the screenwriters is developed so subtly and perfectly, without special effects, and is so central to the plot, that it becomes totally believable and this makes the whole movie happen spectacularly.

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is an all-around fine, sound, decent and \"above-to-well-above-average\" movie. It achieves such a description despite having acting that, in the opinion of this commentator, was not spectacular. Carrey and Winslet put together lead performances that work for their roles and don't disappoint at all, but don't rise beyond such a standard, or towards Award-nominating levels. The real strength of the movie is the long, complex and wonderfully enigmatic plot. This movie makes you think, makes you wonder, about the way the mind works and whether something, such as a relationship or person, can be so \"wrong\" that it/he/she is truly worth forgetting altogether. Such a theme for a movie is tough to pull off, but director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman do so with supreme cinematic and special effect skill. Kirsten Dunst, in a lesser role than that of Carrey and Winslet, doesn't let down either, but comes across thin at times. Wrapup: decent acting, wonderfully intriguing story and expression. Rating: 8.5/10; IMDB rating: 8\n",

      "Hollywood has a short but intense tradition of memory-as-identity and what-is-reality movies; Blade Runner (stylish but dense), Total Recall (sci-fi thriller), Memento (if you like Bach, you'll love this movie), Minority Report (stylish but icy), Paycheck, and a few others. A lot of theme, if not actually based on a Philip K. Dick story, seem to be informed by the ideas and questions he dealt with in his fiction. Now comes Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who, in this movie, finally get to the point(s) that it seems that the other movies have been only touching on occasionally: are we more than our memories?, and if we can't rely on our perceptions, what can we rely on? This movie is different from the others in that it has a heart; in fact, it's all about heart. Jim Carrey's character, Joel, finds out that his girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, has gone to the trouble of having all memories of him erased from her mind (through a procedure that is presented as no more invasive or out of the ordinary than, say, laser surgery), and in revenge, or at least in reaction, Joel decides to have the same procedure done to him. Midway through the night that this is being done, in his dreamlike state, he changes his mind, and at least a third of the movie happens during the time when he is trying to shield his memories of her from the erasing process. He realizes that he doesn't want to lose the memories of her, as painful as some of those may be. Jim and Kate are surrounded by good actors here, but it's Kate Winslet that really shines. Joel's mental state often seems to be a bit confused (that is, I'm not sure where he is) but Kate communicates so clearly with every expression and flick of her eye. And it's a tribute to the writing that this ultimately makes sense; I don't really admire the direction and all of the arty special effects in this film, because it doesn't need it - the script is that good, so good, in fact, that it could probably be acted on a bare stage. Well, maybe not quite. The only time it threatens to come off the rails is in the antics of the actual operators who are doing the erasing, played by Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and joined by Kirsten Dunst and, finally, the superb Tom Wilkinson, who's given the best single line of the movie: when asked if this causes brain damage, replies,\"Well, technically, the procedure IS brain damage\". And what seem to be tangential subplots end up curling back on the main plot in the most unexpected and essential way.As I mentioned, the direction is a bit frantic and the art direction alternates between being a bit too grimy and a bit too mannered for this material, but when one looks at what Speilberg did with Minority Report, one is grateful for small favors. The movie has lots of unexplored nooks and crannies, and you sense that as tight as the script is, it isn't trying to just be a tour de force like Memento, but to make a point that, in Joel's Everyman character's mind, is highly emotional about life and love and pain. It actually fleshes out the whole idea of the replicant Rachel in Blade Runner, who had false memories implanted in her to make her think she was a human; here the opposite is being done, and the characters (and not just the leads) try to deal with the question of just what this has done to their humanity. Other threads that are brought up and touched on or implied are: if you have had this procedure done to you, what are the lasting side effects? And afterward, is there still an attraction between the people - that is, does part of your being still remember? I hope this is remembered later on, not only during awards season, but by others who try to mine this material.\n",

We watch with frantic hope to grasp the story as it runs through Joel's mind.  It's told in a style that is far from linear, jumping from moment to moment without much time to breathe.  Like some bizarre `Alice in Wonderland' adventure.  I kept hoping to see the Cheshire Cat's grim jump into the frame.

I mean if you walk into this movie with hopes of BRUCE ALMIGHTY you'll probably feel as gypped as those Adam Sandler fans that laid out money for PUNCHDRUNK LOVE.That being said the film does overstay it's welcome especially after it weaves in subplots involving Kiresten Dunst and Elijah Wood.  I understand their inclusion in the film I just wished they didn't feel so curt.  They sort of reemphasize points that's are already made by Joel and Clemintine in far more effective ways.  They steal from the self-discovery of the hero, and thus knock the movie down pegs it really didn't have to.So will you like ETERNAL SUNSHINE?  If you're in for an inventive trip with lots of suppress, and you also like to discuss the nature of philosophy and it's effect on man, absolutely.  If not I check something a little lighterI think a casual movie-goer is used to seeing a name like Julia Roberts or Adam Sandler and knowing exactly what to expect from them.  Jim Carrey on the other hand keeps throwing us all for a loop.  He's an actor whose climbed and fought his way to the top because he has the ability to be himself in any role, and yet at the same time engross his audience into believing he's not really there.  With the right director Jim Carrey can shine, even if the material is weak.  He shines in this film even if it doesn't quite match up.\n",

      "Caution: Semi-Spoiler AheadMany more movies like this and a new term is likely to enter the critic's lexicon, 'Kaufmanesque', defined as 'somewhere between reality and fantasy, and aimed at somewhere around the human heart'. Charlie Kaufman's script for 'Being John Malkovich' was mostly fantasy, but involved, apart from a couple of comic turns, some only slightly bizarre people. 'Adaptation' apart from a possibly imaginary twin brother, was an essay in Hollywood metamorphosis, as a piece of sober non-fiction reportage is turned into a crummy action movie ¬ñ nothing fantastic there. This movie involves only slight fantasy ¬ñ the routine removal of unwanted memories by electronic means (does not every computer keyboard have a delete key?), and the central characters are as human and vulnerable as you might find in a big city like New York.While his earlier scripts had straightforward time lines here Kaufman and his director, Michel Gondry rocket back and forth through a series of flashbacks to explain what really happened between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslett). Joel in particular wants to forget the pain but remember the good bits and this interferes with the process. The whole thing is very artfully constructed and makes sense in the end but you have to keep your wits about you ¬ñthere are several different versions of the same incidents and some of the incidents are dreams rather than actuality.Somehow the actors seem to be able to get out their performances despite the flashback high jinks and in the case of Joel and Clementine well-rounded portraits appear. They are opposites of course, Jim the introvert who hardly ever buys clothes and Kate the extrovert who changes her hair colour once a week. Jim Carrey, so often in noisy, eye-rolling roles, puts in a restrained and credible performance and Kate Winslett is convincing as the brash and upfront Clementine. The minor characters such as the technicians Ray (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood)) verge on the comic though Tom Wilkinson is nicely low-key as Dr Mierzwiack of Lacuna Clinic, who devised the memory erasure process. The good doctor turns out to have a past, but it is more mundane than one might have thought.Visually this is quite a stylish movie ¬ñthe beach snow scenes and some of the dream sequences are vividly appropriate. At one point Joel is in his mother's kitchen as a four year old, hiding under a giant table ¬ñ we forget how small we were as young children. Lacuna operate from what looks like a suburban medical clinic using nothing more elaborate than a CAT scanner and laptop computers; there is no attempt to be sci-fi flash (though the headgear Joel wears during the erasure process looks like it was left over from a 'Startrek' episode). You can forget your past but you are still the same person that helped create it. Not remembering, you are likely to repeat yourself. This being the case, this movie does not really have a surprise ending, but Kaufman and Gondry have produced a very attractive and imaginative love story, despite the somewhat difficult format of the picture. As no doubt readers of these columns will be aware the title comes from a poem by Alexander Pope. It's worth bearing in mind that Pope was talking about a Vestal Virgin ¬ñ a professional virgin, in fact. Spotless minds are for virgins. If you engage in living a full life, you are bound to collect some psychic cuts and bruises on the way, and you are probably better off keeping the scars.\n",

      "I've seen this film twice now.  I had to!  The first time totally blew me away and I was speechless for about an hour afterwards.  I had to see it a second time to pick up on more of the little details, and try to appreciate it from more of a technical angle.  Winslet and Carrey are at the top of their game.  The editing and sound was awesome.  Wilkinson did his usual stand-up job.  And Dunst dances around in her underwear, just like every movie she's in.  If you have a hard time piecing together the whole chain of events in this film, go see it again and watch Clementine's hair color. That's the main visual clue they used to make the non-linear storytelling easier to figure out.I'm hoping that a DVD version comes out with a special feature where you can watch the story in chronological.  I have a feeling it was filmed in chronological order (watch the length of the roots of Clementine's hair if you don't believe me) and then cut up for the theatrical version.\n",

      "Screenwriter extraordinaire Charlie Kaufman is one of the most brilliant and inventive people in Hollywood, a town thick with brilliant, inventive people.  BUT, he lost me here. \"Adaptation\" and \"Being John Malkovich\" also played with space and time, but atleast they were heading somewhere, and I could follow them. \"ESOTSM\" (you should do the Donald Trump thing and copyright that term, Charlie!) records and erases itself over and over again, so much so that it's dizzying. Beautifully done (round of applause to the production crew), but dizzying. As the survivor of a few failed starts myself, it made me wonder, did these two characters ever have anything worth getting that upset about? Or was it a lot of smoke, but not much fire?  Even after two hours, it feels like they just met.I've read complaints here about the Mark Ruffalo/Kursten Durnst/Tom Wilkinson/Elijah Wood subplots. Actually, I enjoyed the subplots! They were a sweet (I was about to say \"nice\") diversion. But where was the song from the trailer? I wanted to hear the song from the trailer, not that dreary \"Cougars\" remake from Beck.Charlie, I'm still in awe of you man, but I enjoyed your other movies  more. Neat lessons on love though.\n",

Surrounded by other good/great acting and a good script, this is a movie that everyone should check out at least once.  No matter how weird it might seem from the tv ads and trailers, this movie is one of those small movies that sneak past most ppl's radars. Parts of it will confuse some, but in the end, it is enjoyable to say the least.PS. This film is an early Oscar film for 2004\n",

It is already garnering a devoted following among certain viewers who will watch it over and over, like \"Rocky Horror\" or \"Fight Club\". Also like those films, it has detractors who find it not suited to their taste. Any mass entertainment that is as personal as this and takes the risks that ETOTSM takes will always create a strong love/hate reaction.  Carrey and Winslet are very good, I found the way their characters complemented each other very believable as a basis for their relationship. Winslet, especially, played a character unlike any I have seen before from her. Kirsten Dunst is gorgeous as always, she has some fine moments. The real surprise here for me is Mark Ruffalo. I say just give him the Supporting Actor Oscar NOW, case closed. I could not stop laughing every moment he was on-screen, his nerdy character has some great lines.  Ruffalo makes him very likable, even though he is not exactly what you would call \"conscientious\".  I feel that Charlie Kaufman has hit a new high with this story. It is more honest and poignant about relationships than 100 typical \"romantic comedies\" (many of which are still good movies in their own way). The basic truth is that EVERYONE is flawed and imperfect, and we must accept those flaws in those we love, if we want them to love us in return.\n",

      "I was never a film major but I appreciate a good drama. Some films go over my head though. For example, Solaris, which is brilliant in many ways, but slow-paced and ultimately didn't say anything deep to me. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was similar.I think I get it. Even though relationships have bad sides, they're still worth having. But the film doesn't say it in a very interesting way. The acting was good but I guess it was the slow pacing that caught me the wrong way. No soundtrack, slow, boring. I didn't sense huge chemistry between the protagonists, nor did I find either of them particularly likable. Maybe they were a little too extreme to take seriously, unlike the characters in High Fidelity, another serious drama about relationships that has the same message.I know people who can appreciate certain aspects of a film, such as the costuming or cinematography, regardless of whether the other aspects work. Personally I feel that a film has to be accessible to be great, which this is not. Currently, the film is rated one of the greats of all time. Not in my opinion.Who should see this film:-- Arty types-- Kate Winslet fans-- Romance film types with nothing better to do on a rainy day, but don't expect a comedy, and be ready for melancholyI'll give The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a parts-were-great / parts-were-awful mix of 6 out of 10.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman has written another masterpiece but this is backed by superbly restrained contributions from director Michel Gondry and actors Jim Carrey (amazingly enough!), Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson and co. Billed even by fans as \"confusing\", in fact it is clear as a broken heart on a cold day once you know the gist (ie that first Winslet's Clementine and then Carrey's Joel go to Wilkinson's bizarre neurological practice to have their minds wiped clean of all memories of their failing relationship). The film has an emotional depth detractors of Kaufman's earlier work claim was lacking in them.  In fact the only flaw proved illusory... I thought Kaufman and Gondry had gone on too long when Dunst's letters started to arrive but I was wrong ... this gives Carrey and Winslet the chance to do what they have to do. Highly recommended.\n",

      "Brilliant film. I loved how all the characters added to the movie, there were no extra characters that didn't contribute to the storyline. It was a movie that made you think, also took some unexpected turns that made it interesting. Jim Carrey also reminded us that he is able to play serious characters. Also Kate Winslet, was finally in a really good movie, and she wasn't that bad either. If you want to see a movie that makes you think I recommend this one, and I recommend you go with a friend so you can talk about it after. But if your friend is going to be a distraction, then don't bring them because chances are you will miss something and the movie won't make sense.\n",

      "This is one of the best storylines I have seen yet, along with the special effects used to tell a story, not just cover up it has none like so many others.It's a love story about forgetting the past but wanting to remember the good parts, like most of us do.  I certainly remember the good moments more than the bad, and this film made me remember a lot about being alive and taking risks.At the end of this scifi love drama comes a happy moment out of honesty, and being able to really show how you feel about someone.  As the film ended I went outside and saw that the cherry trees were swirling pink-white petals in little jets around the street and the sun was just rising.  That is a once in a lifetime event, but if you look hard enough you'll see more of them.American Beauty and other films let you in on little secrets of 4th dimensional beauty, like the swirling bag, or in Donnie Darko so many visual elements through space-time that make you ponder your existence.It's nothing I thought it would be, and everything I'd hope it would be. This film has really pushed me forward in film making theory and geared me away from muscle cars, explosions, and hot bikini 'chicks'.  This reminds me of points in 'Lost in Translation' and 'Great Expectations'.  More films should take on epic storytelling like this, because the daily doldrum of movie making is costing more and more every year and producing ever more rotten things.Watch this film.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman is undeniably one of the most talented screenwriters in Hollywood. His films speak volumes about the contemporary human condition, and with an auteur like Michel Gondry at the directorial helm, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind does not disappoint.Together, Kaufman and Gondry experiment with notions of temporality, memory and infinity via a journey into the psyche of the film's painfully shy and introverted protagonist, Joel Barish (played by Jim Carrey). It is with deliberate though graceful trajectorial shifts that love and fate are interwoven, and the raw and honest plunge into Joel's relationship with Clementine (Kate Winslet), his mother and his childhood is positively moving. The concepts of love, memory and human desire are also explored through the supporting characters; and in typical Kaufman form, are craftily entwined with the experiences of both Joel and Clementine.Although the film exercises a healthy dose of Freudian theory to emancipate its bulky and complex narrative structure, I believe it does so with great success. The exposition is effective and meaningful, and does not make compromises typical of the Hollywood romance genre. After all, this film is much more than a love story.If you liked films such as Being John Malkovich, Lost in Translation, or Adaptation, then this one is definitely for you.\n",

      "ESOTSM is a science fiction romantic comedy. The basic premise is the tried and true romantic comedy plot where an ordinary but lovable guy and a kooky, free-spirited but lovable girl fall in love. Except in this case, the two lovers are not so lovable. The guy, Joel (Carrey), is not just ordinary; he's boring and inarticulate. In his imagination, he's more the ladies man, but in real life, he can't even make eye contact with women. The girl, Clementine (Winslet), is an alcoholic narcissist who comes on to guys like Joel to flatter her ego because she's too insecure to try for anyone better. In each of these relationships, she soon realizes just how boring the poor guy is, unceremoniously dumps him, and moves on to the next victim. Here is what I thought was fascinating about the movie--you never get to see what really happened between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clem (Kate Winslet) in their first relationship. I think this is the point of the movie. It's about how our memories distort the reality of relationships. The fun of watching the movie is trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together and figure out what really happened. Unfortunately, the non-linear structure makes this more difficult. Because ESOTSM jumps around in time, it is too easy for viewers to mistakenly to interpret the movie as a series of flashbacks. Actually, I don't think there are any flashbacks at all about the relationship itself. Instead, the movie shows several distorted versions of their affair: Joel's memory of the relationship, Joel's adventure in his own mind in which he and Clem try to evade the memory zappers, Joel and Clem's tape recordings about each other, and finally their second relationship after their memories have been wiped. In each of these versions of reality, you only get hints of what might have happened. Even watching the two fall in love again doesn't tell you that much because you don't know what effect the memory wipes had on their personalities.In Joel's memory and in his imaginary adventure, he's articulate and charming. In real life, he can hardly think of anything to say to a woman. Joel remembers Clem either as more endearing or witchier than she really is. In his imaginary adventure, she is an idealized version of herself, the way he wishes she had been. I have mixed feelings about ESOTSM. I think that the subplot with Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst was boring. The high tech equipment used to perform the memory wipes looked really cheap and unconvincing. Even the doctor's office had a cheap, low-rent look (The doctor can afford all of this cutting-edge medical equipment but he can't even get a decent office?) Ultimately, I could not get past the fact that the two main characters were such losers in real life. Nevertheless, I give the movie 7 out of 10.\n",
      "1589\n",
      "This movie held up even under my high expectations. I had heard so many good things about it, plus, I had seen so many bad movies prior to it that I needed it to be good. It was. Charlie Kaufman impressed me with his brilliant, mind-bending script Adaptation and this one was just as mentally interesting Yet, this had something that Adaptation didn't, it was a genuine love story, and a good one at that.I would classify this movie as a romantic comedy, that hardest genre to make a good movie in. Why? Because there is a formula that such movies as Runaway Bride mastered and Gigli fell victum to. What makes Eternal Sunshine work as a story is that it really plays well on the formula. Instead of following it as if they were rules/guidelines, it feels more as if the plot naturally found those required aspects of the genre.Next in line is the performance power of this unbelievable ensemble cast. With Jim Carrey in an uncharacteristic role, you expect less and get more. Kate Winslet, taking over in the Carrey's usual part, does not let us down and never once has you asking why her hair is not the same color. It just seems a natural progression of the character. Oscar nomination number four here we come.All the supporting roles are well done. The performance of Kirsten Dunst is, prehaps, one of her best. If the movie does well come awards season, she will to. As for Elijah Wood, he is solid, but probably more importantly, very much not Frodo. He will have a career with out Tolkien. He has proven that here. Part of the reason that these supporting performances work so well is because they are each given a subplot that is just shy of being its own movie. It gives all these actors something to grasp and yet they still fit with the main story; they are actually supporting it by providing a greater amount for us to connect with, making it much more believeable in our eyes. ****/****\n",

      "A poignant, poetic, romance, about the pain of a break up, with the sci-fi device of having their memories erased, beautifully performed with touching restraint from Jim Carrey, and exciting, sexy, volatility by Kate Winslett. But the heartrending potential of the story is lost by a style that misses the heartrending possibilities of the story idea.  Instead of allowing the audience to feel the struggle of their attempt to come to terms with the anger that has exasperated their fundamental disparities, and to find each other again in the face this powerful erasing  mechanism, the film gets trapped in irrelevant twists and turns that detract from the inherent promise of the story's potential.  If not for the fine acting of the two attractive stars in a few strong moments it would have been a total loss.\n",

      "*SPOILER WARNING*Wow. Ever seen a movie or heard a song that just sums you up perfectly? When I first saw this movie, I was speechless. Someone had put into words and onto film exactly how I felt. It's better to have loved and to have lost than to have never loved at all. But it's more complicated than just that overused phrase.The movie is about moving past the negative memories of a relationship and focusing on the little things that made you fall in love in the first place. These highlights of a romance should be warm thoughts on cold, lonely nights- would you really want to erase them forever?I appreciated the fact that at the end of the movie, the viewer isn't left with a sense that Joel and Clementine are getting a second chance to make things work. They both acknowledge that at some point, the relationship is going to turn to crap, but so what? It's everything that you feel and experience before the relationship sours that matters.\n",

      "This movie says some wonderfully true and profound things about relationships in the modern world.  Though, if we have human hearts, we will get hurt, we can take them or leave them.  If it gets too rough, if it's not quite right, you don't have to stay.Only by accepting that it will be rough sometimes do we succeed in keeping a relationship afloat for the long term.  In that sense, the film comes down against the technological advance on which its plot is based.  Running away from and forgetting the things that make us unhappy in the end keeps us from attaining happiness.  Only by facing the rough spots and letting them be what they are can we overcome that.We can try to change it, and end up doing desperate things, making even bigger fools of ourselves, putting ourselves and others at even greater risks.  But the hardest thing to do is often the most simple, and yet at the same time the most powerful.  The movie conveys this so elegantly and so subtly, you might miss it.  This is what I love about this movie.\n",

      "This film is, I believe, the most true cinematic portrayal of the nature of relationships that one will ever find. It is also one of the most intriguing explorations of memory and how we perceive it that I have seen.  I feel that this is a movie where we can all identify with the emotions of the main characters, and that Winslet and Carrey portray the multi-layered feelings and personalities perfectly, drawing us into their minds and worlds.Within Winslet's Clementine we can all see the flighty, impulsive, passionate sides of ourselves.  And Carrey plays the introverted, frustrated, classic 'nice' guy Joel with unexpected ease.  Beyond the two main characters, the rest of the cast creates a suitably mundane but skewed world in which the plot seems more expectable than implausible.\n",
      "Cinematically, the look of the film was perfect for portraying the fluid and ironically inescapable world of dreams, and the lighting use floored me the first time I saw it.  The creative camera angles and close shooting really serve to put us 'in' the movie, near enough to feel, if not quite touch, the emotions and characters.While the premises of being able to erase a portion of your life is an intriguing one, my strongest emotive attachment to the movie was through the conundrum of the past failed relationship.  Namely, if you knew what the problems and issues were that would one day force you apart, would you still choose to love and become involved with the person?This movie touched me deeply.  I believe that it's a movie everyone who plans to be in a relationship should see.  And I would pick it as my favorite ever.  Ten of ten, definitely.\n",

      "Wonderful. Simple as that. I could go into a lengthy dissertation about the subtext and details but I don't feel a need to in this instance. One word sums it up. Wonderful. A film I will revisit time and time again for the rest of my life and still be touched, amused & absorbed by every time I see it. A \"It's A Wonderful Life\" for the new century. Truly timeless. No matter how society turns out (progresses/regresses) I believe people will still be loving this film 100 years from now. If the word \"Love\" can be used to describe my affection for this movie, then so be it.The cast & crew may never get the due recognition award-wise that this film deserves (give them ALL their Oscars now for petes sake) but that doesn't matter, because every one who walks away affected by it after they've seen it will regard as up there with the very best that's ever been made.\n",

      "Gondry has made an extraordinary film. It suggests he may be one of the few people who fully understand the potential of this medium. In his recreation of the experience of thought and than his deconstruction of that process, he reveals to us a tactile sense of reality that is normally very difficult to achieve. The potential of film to rearrange our sense of time and space and its ability to challenge our conviction of the \"truth\" of our experience has seldom been this well exploited. Kaufman's very good screen play, which builds a dark intertwining of dysfunctional relationships, is moved to a new level with direction, editing and acting to allow us a window into the mechanism of our private realities.\n",
      "1596\n",
      "\"Eternal Sunshine\" is a complicated story that demands your full attention; Mr. Gondry unfolds it at a mind-bending pace. This alone makes it a hugely refreshing respite from ordinary multiplex fare.The perceived message in the movie was you can't run from your problems, failures, inadequacies. It was also exploration of memory and it's qualities to shape your personality and reactions to relationships. The movie's dialog keeps things real with sharp exchanges and interesting small details.Contrary to what people say about it being hard to follow, I found the editing on a story that COULD have been truly mind bending, to be pleasantly cohesive. If you paid any amount of attention to the film, you would easily and completely understand it.Similar to Vanilla Sky or Punch Drunk Love, it made me kind of hopefully sad. Also in similarity people left during the middle of the movie when they weren't laughing enough. Mass market movie? Not quite yet.The knowledge that with relationships the very good comes with the very bad and vice versa. However, it was very subtle and deft in conveying the message subliminally. Personally, I can't stand when a movie beats you senseless with it's ill fitting one size fits all 'message'.The movie to me was like a great photograph that let's you find the meaning in relation to your own life. A Rorschach test of sorts. If a person can find a way to identify with the situations and ignore the vast number of gaps in the 'science' of the premise they could find their own meaning in it.Reading other user comments cements in my mind that 90% of reviewers don't have a clue about what they are writing here. Another 5% want to complain about a trivial portion of the movie be it style, a plot hole (in a sci-fi movie no less) or the simple fact that they don't particularly care for an actor. This makes surfing for 5% real fairminded reviews a challenge. A great story rips away any preconceived thoughts the actor outside of the films parameters. It's called suspension of disbelief and a few people should lighten up and learn about it or stop watching anything but documentary films. Regarding the use of style techniques in this film, I think that if you have such a major problem with motion sickness during a film, you should get to the film on time so you don't have to sit in the front row, bring motion sickness medicine or just stay at home and not see movies in a theater. I would prefer you do the later.\n",

      "*** Beware *** The following contains minor Spoilers.After \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\", do you think writer Kaufman would turn conventional?  Not in the least.  The film's title is a line from Alexander Pope and fits this plot precisely.  The images are all mixed up, like a dream. No, like a dream that's being constantly interrupted, erased, and replayed.  The screenplay is highly original, going where few movies have gone before, with the notable exceptions of \"BJM\" and \"Adaptation\". The cast is familiar, we've seen them in quite a few movies by now, but here they each create something different.  Kate Winslet is Clementine, the girl of many hair colors, who decides to rid herself of all memories of Joel (Jim Carrey).  Mark Ruffalo, with his hair standing on end, is the computer nerd who hurriedly rushes to put his pants back on when Joel's reprogramming ends prematurely.  Elijah Wood, with the long, long sideburns looks otherworldly (again) as the assistant computer nerd who woos Clementine post-brain damage.  Kirsten Dunst is sweet and her hair is not much different from previously seen in other films as is Tom Wilkinson's, who is quite the ladies man in this pic.  Mr. Carrey goes from trauma to trauma, and is in dire need of a haircut.  Why my obsession with the cast members' hairstyles, you ask?  Why do Joel and Clem walk on thin ice?  Why does Clem work at Barnes & Noble?  Why does the house fall down around them, literally?  Why does Joel hide under the kitchen table and shrink?  What does all this mean? That even though you get bored with someone and are embarrassed to be with them in public and say all kinds of mean things about them behind their backs, it's still likely that this is your one true love?  That premise doesn't work for me.  I see this film as a slight disappointment after the two previous Kaufman films I've mentioned, but superior to much of what's in theaters now.\n",

      "I have very picky tastes when it comes to movies, and ESotSM fulfilled most of my likes. I really enjoyed Charlie Kauffman's writing style, which can be seen in Adaptation and Being John Malcovich. He has a depressing, yet hopeful look at life. No matter what happens, whether it is good or bad has the opportunity for happiness.Michael Gondry's directing and style was unlike many film directors today. I guess that makes sense, because most of the work he has done have been with music videos. I have seen some of the videos he has made. He has made videos for Bjork (the Icelandic sensation), and the Chemical Brothers.Jim Carrey has officially entered the realm of fine cinematic actors. His other serious roles have started this trend to where he is today. Starting with The Truman Show, followed by The Majestic. ESotSM has really put him to a new level in acting, one that I hope he will continue on for quite some time.I rate this movie a 9/10, because its hard to consider it perfect...\n",

What if we could erase the memory of our painful past and failed love affairs?  The pain would perhaps go away and we could continue without dragging the past.  This is the essence of this movie.  It is about choices too, the choices of life. Shooting, characterization, acting, editing, plot and storytelling are all great.  Wonderful cast and Jim Carrey played a gloomy ordinary man that had joyful streaks when with his love interest who is played Kate Winslet.  He performs greatly and leaves the exaggerated style of his former comic personalities perfectly behind.  This movie definitely proves his talent for drama roles. He is stepping up to the platform of the greatest and should be nominated for Oscars next year.  Mr. Kaufman's script is just wonderful.

I love Charlie Kaufman, but Adaptation and Being John Malkovich don't quite make it anywhere near my top favorite movies list.It's a perfect role for Jim Carrey... he can be play serious, but his character is still wacky and ends up making you laugh.The beginning of the movie almost scared me... \"Oh no, is Jim Carrey going to throw himself a pity party over the loss of his beloved Clementine\" I thought.Luckily, things warm up and it even has a happy ending, so it makes the trip into Jim Carrey's mind worthwhile. Of course, the line that James Verini of the LA Times attached onto was \"I'm in my head already aren't I?\"I would have not even caught this line if it had not been pointed out by the reviewer. Chaos is all around Jim's character when he almost mumbles the line. Later in the movie, he should have said something to the effect or \"Clementine is in my head already, isn't she?\"This is a journey of Clementine and Joel Barish through Joel's mind.  The reviews make it sound like Joel has to figure out how to save Clementine from being erased.  He doesn't have to figure out anything.  Clementine herself comes up with the idea of running to different parts of the brain where they won't look for them.The plot sounds almost cheesy, but it's a heartwrenching and eye-opening tale sort of like Annie Hall, only it's fantasy and it doesn't end up so terribly sad.  10/10\n",

      "ETERNAL SUNSHINE restores uber-hyped Charlie Kaufman's lofty position in the upper echelon of quirky modern screenwriters which began with BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, continued in CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, faltered a tad with HUMAN NATURE, came back with ADAPTATION, and returns full force with this effort.  Arty, jarring, striking, unorthodox and touching, ETERNAL SUNSHINE is a treatise on the joys, heartaches and tenuous nature of romantic love which is full of knowing observations and insights.  Add in Jim Carrey's most straightforward and likably subdued effort, a winningly quirky turn from Winslet, and solid ensemble work from Big Names Wilkinson, Wood and Dunst and the result is a genuinely appealing non-linear ride which combines MEMENTO with PUNCH DRUNK LOVE.  One of the most original and enjoyable rides of the year, and one of the better relationship movies I've ever seen. Don't miss it.  10 / 10.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind deserves the praise it is getting. All I heard about this film before I went to see it was that it was a Kaufman script and the leading man was Carrey. What I ended up finding was an engaging script, paradoxically relate-able, anchored by outstanding performances. Carrey shines an otherwise drab character, Mark Ruffalo is funny and superb and I didn't think Kate Winslet could be any more appealing than she is in this film. I loved the plot (what's more, I understood it) and I loved the people, even when you perhaps shouldn't. That elderly couple that passed me in the cinema and said \"I didn't like it\" should eat some soap. A credit to all involved, they inspired me to begin writing scripts again after a 6 month sebbatical. PS. I hope 'sebbatical' iss spelt correcttly.\n",

      "The beginnig of this film was beautiful. The beach in Montauk, New York on a wintry day. Snow blowing. Jim Carrey stubbornly forced to meet and sit with a random punkish girl(Kate Winslet)on a metro north train and ends up sleeping at her house. The next day,his life basically starts over, when he finds out that she was in his passed and had him erased from her memory.From there, you are filled with all of his emotions, sadness, hope, and happiness. An inspirational film with a great new role for Jim Carrey. The film goes from his hard times to a heart warming finale with lots of laughs along the way. Truly a sweet movie. If you loved Adaptation, you will love Kaufman's best script yet.\n",

Great performances, and just really does send you on a trip through your own mind and you felt a kinship with the characters.Jim Carrey really gets you into the character as well as Kate Winslot, I cannot give this movie enough praise at the moment since I only saw it less than an hour ago!Definately one to put next to my copy of Lost In Translation.Looking forward to picking this up on dvd.Recommend itExcellent 5/5\n",

      "No matter how good looking a guy you are, a woman who looks like Kate Winslet is not going to hit on you that hard on the Long Island Railroad. I'm willing to forgive Charlie for that stretch of the imagination.But I can't forgive him for this plot hole.  The Clem that is being erased from Joel's memory is not the real Clem, but the Clem that is in Joel's mind.  How is it then, that this element of Joel's memory (i.e., the fake Clem) is able to tell Joel to goto Montauk?  And how is it that Joel actually remembers to goto Montauk the next day, but remembers nothing else about his relationship with Clem?  And how is it that Clem ends up in Montauk too on the same day?  When Clem was having Joel erased, did the Joel in Clem's mind tell her to goto Montauk on a certain day?  If that happened, the same question...How can the fake Joel tell Clem to do anything and how was she capable of remembering it?Great movie, I gave it a 9.  If Kaufman did not leave this gaping plot hole, I'd probably put it in the top 50.\n",

      "If you've ever felt the shivers of a new relationship then this movie is a must! This movie is an eye opener, in my opinion, for people feeling a little iffy about their current relationship. Especially if you really love the person you're with and they are just getting on your nerves a bit. As you know the story goes that Jim Carrey wants to have Kate W. erased from his mind because she has already done this to him. J.C. undergoes the procedure and that's where most of the movie takes place, in his mind. During these shots, there is acting and there are lines that will just tear you apart. Such beautifully written verse portraying a man desperate to hold to just apiece of memory of the girl that he once loved. You can feel the agony and emotion during every memory. Jim Carrey runs around like a madman trying to hide Winslet's character, just so when he wakes up he'll at least have a fragment of the memory of her left. The problem is that with this procedure everything must be erased. And even though there are all the bad memories of broken relationships, suffice it to say when you dig deep enough you remember those good ones when you once were in love.  There is a line in the movie, and although many stuck with me, this one nailed it. Jim Carrey is talking about the first encounter between himself and Kate and he says, \"I saw her there on the beach in that orange sweatshirt that I loved so much but I would grow to hate.' Maybe not an exact quote, but close. When you fall in love, everything is so perfect, your partner's style, the way they laugh and even eat. But as time passes, sometimes you grow so deeply in opposite directions and you're interest gets lost with the time. Codependency keeps those relationships fueled though. But imagine if you could have the person's memory erased from your mind, such a quick and easy way out. What a concept. Beautiful movie... must see on the big screen, don't get stuck crying alone at home.\n",

The concept of heartache in a movie never been so more creative funny and just damn real. I am impressed and truly love Jim Carey as a vulnerable character. I am officially Kate Winslet fan, I have always liked her some what but now confirmed she is great! The Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (played by Tom Wilkinson), wife and his scientific assistant Stan (played by Mark Ruffalo) were fabulous.Elijah Wood & Kirsten Dunst did not fit.

I had to close my eyes for 95% of the movie.  The camera operators should be fired.  I was so disappointed about it, I was really looking forward to the film.  The concept was very appealing and from where I sat (eyes closed), it sounded like very good.   I'm a real fan of Charlie Kaufman, the only original thinker in Hollywood these days.  They should have stuck with the same kind of work as 'Adaptation' and 'Being John Malkovich'.  I am glad to see Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet break from their traditional casting, both are so talented.\n",

      "For those who enjoy a film that wakes your imagination, this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. The plot is consuming, the acting is superb, and the screenplay compels the viewer to become emotionally linked to the actors.Without giving too much away, it asks the question \"if you could erase a lover from your memory, would you?\" Jim Carey wrestles with that question in regard to a failed relationship with Kate Winslett. I must admit that I was not interested in any of Winslet's previous films, but was impressed with her effort in \"Spotless.\" And think that Carey is coming into his own as a dramatic actor, (see \"The Majestic\").It is my wish that Hollywood would spend more time making films of this caliber, but perhaps the thing that makes it so special is that it is a departure from the norm.\n",

      "...than to miss the meaning of this film.  For everyone who has ever wished they could smear white-out over a broken heart, \"Eternal Sunshine\" is here to remind us that, for all the thorns the memories of a lost love may carry, they also embody the most worthwhile moments of our lives. In this age of computers and videotape and the science of brain chemistry, we have become accustomed to the notion that memory is readily created and destroyed, allowing \"bad data\" to be erased in order to allow for a fresh start. Sometimes, it might seem tempting to apply this concept to our own minds when the aches of sadness and longing threaten to turn into depression. But would you really want to, if it were possible?  Our most profound experiences are what shape and enhance our being--and few experiences are more profound than the state of loving, or being in love.  To delete parts of ourselves in order to relieve short-term pain (or even long-term regret) would undo our maturation as complete human beings--a fate ultimately far worse than learning to live with loss.Through several different well-acted characters (most notably Joel and Clementine), this film communicates the importance of emotional context in our lives, and the way in which that context is integral to identity.  The nonlinear presentation of the story, rather than being a gratuitous gimmick intended to catch the eye of the modern filmgoing generation, serves as both an effective and ultimately intriguing narrative device and an accurate metaphor for the subject of the film itself: the structure of human memory. Carrey is quite believable as a self-conscious introvert, Winslet even better as a free spirit with an odd sense of desperation about her; Dunst and Wood ultimately stand out in supporting roles.  This might be the greatest filmmaking victory yet for Charlie Kaufman (who planted its seed amidst the orchids of \"Adaptation,\" in a scene where one of his alter-egos [played by Nic Cage] recalls his memory of an unrequited love as a treasured possession that he would allow no one to take away--even the object of that love, a young woman who had openly held him in low esteem).  Here, he delves much more deeply into the theme of love and its meaning to the lover, and creates a movie that, in DVD form, will undoubtedly find its way into the spiritual patch kit of millions of breakup victims, alongside mint chocolate chip ice-cream and the Tori Amos CD catalogue.(Rating: nine out of ten.)\n",

      "Charlie Kaufmann is a very clever and creative screen writer. He's comfortable with the uncomfortable moments we can all relate to!I enjoyed this film immensely, which was actually hard for me to do after my wife bailed on account of the \"shaky camera syndrome.\" It doesn't bother me, but for those of you like her I guess wait for the DVD. Sigh...they can get an \"all-star\" cast and can't afford a steadicam??Good news re that all-star cast...Winslow gets to be the wacky one, and her idiosyncracies feel real. Confused and concupiscent! Meanwhile, Carrey is hopped down on medication and delivers a poignant performance. His inner fire chief is thankfully watered down in nearly all scenes (but I'll wager that the Mystery Science 2000 treatment of the drive-In film scene was ad libbed...yawn).Tom Wilkinson should get more love here, I thought he was outstanding.This film is wistful but never maudlin. If you've read other reviews, yes the plot is scrambled...but definitely not lobotomized. Seemingly confusing, but underneath it has crystalline clarity. What a construction, and a de-construction at the same time. Chocolate on my peanut butter....All that and Lata Mangeshkar and a Kiss \"Love Gun\" t-shirt too! Usually I'll feel a more cathartic empathy with characters, but this film really triggered my own awkward ganglia and tender dendrites.Thanks very much to Kaufmann and kritters for this9/10\n",

      "I saw this movie a few weeks ago and thought this was truly one of the greatest films I'd seen in a long time.  This is not only a brilliant idea, and original as far as I know, but very creatively done.  There is something for everyone.  Who hasn't suffered loss in a relationship?  Who hasn't hurt so bad from some loss that they didn't at least entertain the thought of \"what if I never met the person in the first place?\"  Or Can I just get past this damn hurt part and fast forward to the living again?  Very few.  But for them, there's still the memories of getting picked on as a kid or getting bathed in the sink.And the ending.  Incredible depiction of human nature to go for the forbidden fruit!  Even when they are telling their own selves that the relationship is bad and that the person is horrible.. they still want to go back to eachother.  It's like in real life.. you can tell yourself over and over again that someone is wrong for you, and you know it.. yet, there's something that draws you.  This movie just turns that inside person to life... and each character is literally TELLING THEMSELVES to stay away. And excellent job all around to cast, writer and director in catching the awkward feelings and embarassment of listening to yourself trashtalk a near stranger that you have developed a new crush on.  Great scene!  I couldn't stop laughing.But here's the thing that I saw, and maybe I'm too much like my Highschool Poetry teacher, reading things that aren't there...BUT...Anyone else notice that the van door was missing the \"c\"?  I can only assume that this is on purpose, because, Why else?  So it got my mind going.  I presume the director was leaving a hidden little treasue/ puzzle for the audience.  I don't speak Spanish, but what little I do know, makes me assume that the \"La una\" left behind when the \"c\" is taken off the door means \"The One\".  By itself, it doesn't really mean much.  But if there is no \"c\" in \"the one\", does that also mean...There is no seein' the one.Which is what Lacuna does.  Erase your mind so that there is no seeing \"the one.\"Anyone know anything more about this?  Am I on to something or is this just old news?\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004)  D: Michel Gondry.This is the best film to come out of Hollywood since \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (1995).  I've seen \"Eternal Sunshine...\" five times now and it keeps getting better every time I see it. Its clear by other comments that I've read that this movie really strikes a chord with many people.  They see themselves as Joel who has known a Clementine in their lifetime and as Clementine who has known a Joel in their lifetime.  And that's the magic of this film.  Those who have really been affected by it see portions of previous relationships in the movie.I can't see any movie that comes out for the rest of this year topping this one. Not that 'Oscars' mean much, but if the value of a movie is defined by Academy Awards then \"Eternal Sunshine...\" deserves Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score.\n",

      "With few exceptions it is said that in California gambling is illegal. Rest assured however, one can still gamble at their local theatre, and tonight I lost my shirt. From the start Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, drags on and on and on. I'm not certain whether there might be a `good part' or not. No such part emerged in the hour my wife and I stomached before finally walking out. Cutting room floor. perhaps that's where the good part is. Unbelievable, or nearly so, that this cast should come together in such a superbly terrible piece of work. Looking about the theatre it was clear that we were far from being the only disappointed viewers. I can only imagine that others were envious of us for having escaped. OK, so how bad was it really? Possibly the worst flick I've ever seen. and that's even taking into account `THX1138'. Perhaps there is a more positive perspective to be had.

I wasn't up for anything intense, like \"The Passion of the Christ.\"I wasn't up for something silly, like \"Starsky & Hutch.\"I did want to be kept thinking throughout a movie, and I had seen a few commercials for this movie -- \"Eternal Sunshine of whatever it's a real long title but I know enough of it to find its listings.\"Up front, it was the best movie I saw for free, but I would have definitely paid $9.25 for this.It seems like a lot of movies try using a herky-jerky camera angle and passing it off as \"art.\" Obviously that's not enough to make a good movie, but it's enough to make an audience queasy.Was I the only one who went \"Wow, David Cross is in this movie,\" only to find out he was in about two scenes and had just one good line about the birdhouse?The premise alone is \"secretly universal.\" What I mean by that is everyone has that one relationship they wish they could just erase from their mind. You'd think it would be just one quick sweep of the brain and -POW- they're removed. Instead, watching Jim Carrey relive the memories one by one would probably make you never want that person to leave yourself ever -- even the bad moments.It really gets you thinking about your own ex-girlfriends, ex-boyfriends, estranged relatives, and those teachers and bosses you hated.\"Eternal Sunshine\" is like a modernized \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" only instead of seeing what it would be like if he was dead, he sees what it's like to have someone slip from your grasp.Unfortunately, once he knew what it was like, there was nothing he can do about it.  Reminds me of \"Defending Your Life.\"  You meet someone you adore, but at some point you will exist not knowing they ever graced your eyes.That's the long version, here's the short version -- You might as well see this masterpiece at the big screen, because I don't see what a DVD would add to it.\n",

Impulsively, Clementine undergoes a procedure to have all her memories of Joel erased. A crushed Joel follows suit, only to change his mind after the process has begun. Much of the film takes place in Joel's mind, in the memories he is desperate to keep. Did I mention this is a Charlie Kaufman screenplay?Kaufman's twisted story is in good hands with director Michel Gondry, whose inventive visuals border on the magical. Grounded in fine performances by the leads, the film is also deeply felt and heartbreaking romantic.

      "SPOILER, ALL THE WAY THROUGH******* It scares me that people are so inured to the straight line narrative that they cannot understand a story told differently.  So let me explain-- and this is meant for those who have seen the movie and just do not understand it.  The first scene you see (winter beach in Montauk), and the close-to-last scene (getting out of bed, going to the train, deciding to go out to Montauk beach), are what is happening \"now.\"  The rest of the movie explains how Joel and Clementine got to the beach and what happened between their first meeting at a party on the beach in summer, and their subsequent first meeting on the beach in winter after memory erasure.So what did happen?  They met each other on the beach at a summer party, loved each other, and finally she got bored and he grew tired of her \"charming\" ways.  Clementine went to Lacuna to have her memory of Joel erased.  Then Joel followed suit. However,the technician, Stan, and the girl from the office, Mary, get stoned and drunk while doing Joel's memory erasure and screw it up. During the erasure, we see each memory of the relationship as it happens, and as it is being erased from the memory. At times Joel is partially aware of the erasure process taking place.  This half-in, half-out state is what enables Joel to see what is taking place, and at times he is watching himself in the memories, and at other times, he is watching himself and the technicians as they attempt to erase his memory. (What may confuse you is that sometimes he is in the present watching the Lacuna techs erase the memories, and other times, he is in memories as they are being erased.  Other times the movie is NOT in Joel's head, but is in the room with Stan and Mary, etc.)  While experiencing the memory erasure, Joel realizes how much he really loves Clementine.  Joel decides that he does not want to erase all memory of Clementine, and so he tries to hide a memory of her in several places where he thinks it will be safe from the memory erasure process -- first, in an embarrassing childhood scene, and then in a scene of humiliation, and finally in a scene of shame.  In one memory, Clementine is able to tell Joel to meet her in Montauk-- and somewhere in the recesses of his mind, he still remembers this, and instead of going to work the morning after the mind erasure, he takes the train to Montauk, where he once again meets Clementine on the beach.  Their relationship starts fresh and new.  They both realize what has happened with the memory erasure when Mary, from Lacuna, in a move toward ethicality, mails all of the clients their files with the audio tapes they made in their initial visits to Lacuna.To complicate the mess further, Patrick, the other Lacuna tech, decides he is \"in love\" with Clementine -- while she is knocked out in the memory erasure process.  He steals the bag of items that Joel brought to the office-- all the love notes, journal entries, sketches, etc., that he has done for and about Clementine. Patrick uses these items to cause Clementine to like him, quoting Joel's words.  However, Clementine senses that something is wrong - because Patrick is using Joel's exact words, this spurs memories of Joel to return to Clementine's mind.And what is it that most interferes with Joel's memory erasure, aside from the sloppy work of the two techs? It is that Patrick is talking about his obsession with Clementine during the initial phases of the Joel's memory erasure--while they are still connecting the wires-- and this causes Joel to have new memories and understanding that Patrick is involved with Clementine.  The Lacuna process is not so foolproof-- the company even needs to send out notices telling friends not to mention the person who was \"erased.\"  ALL IN ALL, this movie is beautifully shot, beautifully edited, has wonderful sound and music, wonderful sound editing, a wonderful script, fantastic acting, even superb lighting. The movie is touching, and deep, and hilarious at times.  This is a movie that says that love is never perfect, and we need to take love with its faults, if we want to have love.  MY thanks to Kaufman, Gondry, and all, for giving me this incredibly special couple of hours spent in movie magic.\n",

      "Very interesting story about a couple undergoing surgery to erase each other from their minds. The relationship between the characters is the main focus here, its romantic and realistic, and it has its ups and downs. Joel is played by Jim Carrey, and thankfully this movie is not a typical comedy from him. Throughout the film we get to see them together in various situations and stages of their relationship, often amusing, and this is a pleasure to watch. The story is a mixed up, but will fall into place towards the end of the movie. You're left wondering what would happen if you erased people from your own memory.Nice romantic comedy. 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n",

      "I like many other people were doubly disappointed when an undeserving film (Lord of the Rings) stole the awards from the more deserving films. Luckily, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was the perfect remedy for those tired of the cheesy lines and lackluster effects.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind brought back the idea that film should be art, and not computer generated special effects.  The film itself was one of most ingenious works of art I ever saw. The acting was magnificent, the editing was stupendous, and photography was imaginative, making it one the best and most memorable films I have ever saw.  Very rarely is a film worth eight dollars at the shows, but this one is worth at least ten fold.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the perfect movie for anyone that loves film or poetic literature.  But for those into senseless explosions and \"plotless\" action I also recommend this film, because everyone at some point needs to open their mind.Overall Ratting --10/10\n",

Absolutely Charlie Kaufman's best work till this day, and I anxiously await his untitled project coming 2005.  until then, let me just say if you have not seen eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, drop everything and go see it as soon as possible.

      "I just saw the movie a few hours ago and couldn't wait to write about how much I loved it. Eternal Sunshine is exquisite. It's an honest portrayal of the difficulty making relationships work. The sparks last until the other shoe falls, and you see how flawed your loved one is (and they see how flawed you are too). Relationships end because each is fed up with their mates annoying quirks. After breaking up (or being dumped) you may wish with all your heart that you never met that person or could wipe them from your memory. This film explores what happens when that becomes a viable option. Jim Carrey was perfect. Not only did he nail the dramatic performance, but he also added nuances of humor that I think only he could have done. If Ed Norton had the role I have no doubt he would do a great performance of heartache and turmoil. But Carrey uses his (handsome but) everyday Joe looks and demeanor to convince the audience that he's the quiet, level-headed one in the relationship. Then he busts out doing some pretty hilarious stuff. Kate Winslet is magnificent- she would do any role justice. I have to say that the movie also has some pretty harrowing chase scenes- if you can call them that. They effectively engenders the fear, urgency and desperation that so many conventional car chase scenes try to create. spoiler warning: Don't read further if you haven't seen it!!No matter how difficult a relationship becomes- you could at least learn from the experience and accept it or move on and never put yourself in that situation again. For instance, Mary thought it best that she erase her affair with Howard from her memory. She didn't know that it only lead to heartache because he wouldn't leave his wife and because of the pain it caused his family. Unfortunately with her memory of it all cleared, she developed her school girl crush again and acted on it- again. Kaufman also conveys his \"those-who-do-not-learn-from-history-are-doomed-to-repeat-it\" message with a clever non-linear plot structure. Although we believe the first act is a portrayal of how Joel and Clementine first meet, we learn in the third act that this is actually how they reunite with all the exciting fury of a new relationship. After the movie returns to the events of the first act, it examines how Joel and Clementine deal with the discovery of their shared past and the issues they had with one another. Why should they try stay together when they know how much they can infuriate each other? Obviously to Kaufman, the desire to work out problems is stronger when the memory of their kindling love is not sullied by recent fights and mutual resentment.\n",

      "The plot is original: Joel finds out that Clementine has erased him from her memory.  In revenge, he tries to have her erased from his memory, but then realizes he doesn't want to lose all the memories of her.  The movie doesn't follow a chronological sequence; it is one of those movies where everything makes sense at the end.  I usually like movies that keep me guessing till the end, but this isn't one of them.  I mean, I liked it, but I didn't love it.  It's a movie that I admire more than like.  \tI know people will disagree with me, but one of the reasons for my lukewarm approval of the movie is, simply, it tries too hard to be smart.  Don't get me wrong, it is a smart movie with some terrific writing, but as the movie wore on, I sort of lost patience with it.  For example, there are many scenes showing Joel and Clementine's relationship that are deliberate placed out of order.  For the first hour or so, it worked for me because it was interesting, and I had never seen anything like it.  But I felt some scenes just felt out of place¬Ö",
      "if you can understand the `humiliation' scene, please explain it to me.  \tDespite my reservations with the plot, I thought the movie was very well-acted.  Jim Carrey gives a great, nuanced performance ¬ñ sad, happy, tired.  He looks very weathered in the movie and it works here.  Kate Winslet also gives a great performance.  Her impulsive, spunky Clementine is the perfect compliment to Carrey's despair.  The supporting characters are also fantastic, particularly Tom Wilkinson as the doctor, and Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as his assistants.  I didn't like Kirsten Dunst, though; she irritated the hell out of me.  \tDon't let my opinions stop you from seeing this movie.  It's one of those movies that you like a lot or you like a little.  And, to its credit, it's the most original movie so far this year.  The most enjoyable?  Maybe not.\n",

      "This film has easily become my new favourite film.  Where should I start? The cinematography was great, the acting was Brilliant, the story was amazing and original.  It was also just an enjoyable film to watch.  Some of it was a bit challenging, but I, like many other people like that.  I have yet to see a better film.  After seeing some other Kauffman works, I couldn't wait for this film to come out.  All it took was for me to see the trailer and I was sucked in to the magic of this film.  The only thing I didn't like about this film was the soundtrack.  But I didn't really pay any attention to that.  Overall the film is Beautiful.  A perfect 10 out of 10.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is so visually exciting and intelligently written, that I felt my mind working in overdrive after seeing it in the theater a couple of weeks ago.  I craved conversation, and I wanted to sit and discuss it with anyone I could, and immediately wanted to watch it again.  It was touching, smart, funny, and mind-bending.  I know that a lot has been made of Carrey's performance so I won't belabor the issue, but let me just say that I completely forgot I was watching Jim Carrey.  (Something I consider to be one of the highest compliments I can pay to the man.)  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a beautiful film, and a Charlie Kaufman first for me ¬ñ I actually wasn't scratching my head and saying, `I loved it, but¬Ö",

      "I just saw the movie tonight, it was marvellous. The disjointed chronology of the plot line was confusing at first, but by the time everything wrapped up, I couldn't have been anymore pleased with how the story was meted out. Easily the best movie in Jim Carrey's career to date and a good addition to those of Kate Winslet, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst.Neither the cinematography or soundtrack stood out particularly strongly, but the movie was easily carried along on its plot and the strength of its cast. It's the most satisfying movie written by Charlie Kaufman that I've seen, and though it's also probably the most \"normal\" of his movies that I've seen, I still found it quite striking.\n",

      "Kate Winslet has not made a bad film to date, so with my own bias in check, I was eagerly awaiting this release.  Ms. Winslet certainly did not disappoint, but Jim Carrey was the surprise of the film.I loved Jim Carrey in The Truman Show.  I believe the man can act, but ten too many facial contortion roles (a la Ace Ventura) and pathetic screenplays (like Bruce Almighty) clouded his acting ability to the point where his persona overshadowed any shallow role he would take.  ...But, not here -- you finally get to see him act like he's capable within a character that is just phenomenal.The Kate Winslet character is the perfect drug for which Jim Carrey needs to be cured.  His attempt to erase her memory takes you on a wonderful trip inside his mind that rivals a Wonka factory visit.Pay attention, there's a lot to enjoy in this film.  Eternal Sunshine is one of those rare films (especially today) that has a great premise, superb acting and stays with you long after you leave the theater.Kudos to the filmmakers, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet; let's see 1000 more films like this.(And if there's any possibility of erasing film memories, I'd like to add pretty much every Ben Affleck movie to my list to be erased!)\n",

      "Okay, so its been hard for me to understand where the genius is.  What was the thing that I missed in Being John Malkovich??  Why didnt I like Adaptation??  I'm supposed to be apart of the smart movie-goers...Okay, so Eternal Sunshine looks a little goofy and cute so I was kinda looking forward to it, but I was also hoping that the map would be a little clearer on this movie trip.  I guess having slightly low expectations for a Charlie Kaufman flick gave me a good starting point.  Now, Quinton and Nolan have shown me that they have a way with doing things out of order that I respect, and the slight out of order taste that unravels in the end of this film was done so well.  There are so many parts and things, the little things, that I just really really like about this movie.  The whole time that Joel is trying to stop this pretty much unstoppable procedure was just so interesting.  You have Clem there, pretty much trying to help and the whole time I'm thinking, how freaking cute...here Joel is just thinking of how Clem would be.Joel:      Im sorry I'm erasing you, but you did it firstClementine:I know, I know...but you know how impulsive I amThen the part where they are back in an old memory and Clementine goes on and on about the outfit Joels memory has her in...its just so cute to see how Joel just knows her...This only adds to the part where she finally sees a piece of jewerly he had bought for her and she says, Funny, no boyfriend I've ever had really knew my taste...They did love each other...it just makes me wonder what Clementine was going through when Joel was being erased.So hurray for me, I like this Charlie Kaufman movie.\n",

      "I've long been a Kaufman devotee and with each piece he is evolving into a writer that forces us to regress back to our inner-most primitive core via the \"peeled onion\" approach.  This is far and away the best film I've seen in years, moving me to recollect each one of my \"failed\" relationships with a new perspective and encouraging me to view my current with a renaissance that I feel (hope?) will endure.  How many times must our hearts be ripped from our chests, thrown down and stomped on, shoved back in only to do it all over again, time after time until we get it right.  An exceptional film that captures raw, pure emotion like none other before it, inspirational without being sappy, this is the \"Annie Hall\" of our time.  I look forward to Kaufman's and Gondry's next projects, hopefully another collaboration. BTW, the soundtrack/score by Jon Brion is worthy of mention.\n",

      "I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I seriously think this is Jim Carrey's best performance. Kate Winslet did a magnificent job as well, she didn't slip once with her British accent.The camera angels and effects really made the movie spectacular: when they were lying down on the ice was one of my favorites. I also liked the last shot; it got brighter and brighter and all of a sudden just blacked out. Another effect I liked is when they showed Carrey and Winslet as children size, but they were still adults.If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you go out and see it ASAP.\n",

      "Another jumbled historical-first approach to moviemaking, much like Memento or Pulp Fiction. ...except this time its more artistic.\n",

The movie has a little of everything, without spreading itself too thin.Elijah Wood seemed to be a poor choice for his role, yet mostly pulled it off.\n",

Eternal Sunshine is smart, interesting, incredibly well-acted and thoughtful...I love the idea of a movie which works inside the brain in a way and this is delightful surrealism.  This is definitely one to see if you get the chance.Enjoy it! ****1/2\n",

      "Trying to recall specific detail as time - the ultimate memory eraser - moves forward and away from this past Sunday evening, when I watched this in the theater.  This movie influenced me to call out of work on Monday, in need of a 'mental health day' (take only one or two days off per year). That was quite a reaction for me.  I watch many a film - at least one daily...from foreign classics, classic 70's flicks, silents, to 'obscure' noir and the such.  However, it was this movie that has prompted me to want to live/watch less movies/appreciate my husband/etc., etc./think a bit more and breathe. I wasn't at all a fan of the Kaufman sensibility, certainly not a fan of most contemporary filmmaking.  But without hesitation, I will recommend this film.  I personally feel that Gondry did a magnificent job in scupting the visual aspect upwards, outwards, inwards - the direction was definitely harmonized and proportionate to the complexities of the script.  This film buoys the viewer within the heart and the head. [I am quite perturbed by the reviewer of 4.3 who disdains those who love and/or appreciate the film as having no education other than the modern pop-culture stuff and therefore in turn having no valid opinion or privilege to discern a movie as interesting, impactful, or astonishing, we all must be scorned.]  Anyway. This was a masterpiece in every way.  I will see it again this week and will bring as many people with me as possible, because it is a gift to the soul...and it seems for those who really connected with it, a sort of mirror. 9/10 (subject to change upon repeat viewings, but I expect it to ultimately be 10/10 in my book)\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind may be one of the most bizarre movies that I've ever sat through.  I understand its visual nature and its attempt at real emotion but it just didn't resonate with me.  Don't get me wrong, I liked this film it's just that I hardly think it deserves to be called a classic.  Jim Carrey gives one exceptional performance and it's always great to see Kirsten Dunst dancing around in her underwear. The sad fact is, when you think about it, they are doomed to repeat the misery they just tried to erase.  I know that's precisely the point but it's still cruel none-the-less.  I'm glad they decided to give Kate Winslett's character the crazy hair colors because it was easier to track the progression of time through Jim's mind.  Overall, this film was hardly spotless but it was interesting.\n",
      "1640\n",
      "*spoilers? I don't think so*\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is an excellent consideration of the implications of memory loss.  Or rather, memory erasure.  I imagine most readers know the basic plot elements by now: Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play a pair of lovers who have decided that their relationship has gotten so awful that it would be better to not be able to remember it at all.  Or, to be more accurate, she wipes him from her memory after a vicious comment he makes in an argument, and, despondent, he follows suit.The main part of the movie consists of Carrey's character Joel Barrish in a pseudo-dream sequence as the technicians from the memory erasure clinic slowly remove his important memories involving his girlfriend Clementine (Winslet), one by one.  The nonchalance of the technicians, played by Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood, contrasts strongly with Joel's increasing despondence, as he realizes to his horror that he wishes to hold onto his memories, as the good memories reflect the best times of his otherwise miserable life.These sequences hit deep emotional chords.  One of the nice things about Charlie Kaufman films (I'm thinking of this film, \"Being John Malkovich\", and \"Adaptation\"), is that his characters are not brimming with glamour as happens so often in Hollywood.  Cusack is pathetic in \"Malkovich\", Cage is lumpy and detached in \"Adaptation\", and in this film, Carrey is a bit grimy, while Winslet is deeply flighty.  The supporting cast is also excellent; in addition to Ruffalo and Wood, Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst do excellent jobs as the memory removal doctor and his receptionist, respectively. \n",
      "This movie is science fiction at its best.  Science fiction, when the genre started, was not so much about flying through space and killing aliens, but rather about working with a simple concept, in this case memory erasure, and tugging on that thread, so to speak, to see how such a possibility would change our lives.  While other films in recent years, most notably Memento and Vanilla Sky, have tackled this subject, none have done it with the appreciation of grubby humanity that Kaufman brings to the topic.Some reviewers have complained that the movie was confusing in direction, and weighed down by Kaufman's eccentricities.  I could not disagree more! For me, the eccentricities are essential!\n",
      "1641\n",
      "I'm completely sold on the Charlie Kaufman thing. I will await the next Kaufman film with anticipation of a mix of the surprises and the reprises that he riffs on so well. The writing and the direction and how the concept is handled really worked for me in this film. Low tech science fiction without any lasers or fins growing out of the back of anyone's head. I felt that if there was a weakness of the film it was in the match of the actors to the project. Jim Carrey felt almost the right kind of anonymous for the material because he seemed to playing far enough against his persona and I thought his performance was the one stellar exception. I couldn't help but wishing that the rest of the casting had been more quirky and unknown. I wish that about most films though, so don't take it the wrong way, any fans of Winslet and Froto out there. This movie I think would have had a little more sizzle without casting what kind of feels like the tired (albeit cute) same old faces.This is one of the best films I have seen in the theatre in sometime. Must see for fans of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation.\n",

      "When the opening credits of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind eventually rolled onto the screen, I was already planning to buy this movie. By the closing credits, I had made a list of everyone in my family who I would purchase this movie for and listed 2 copies by my own name. Not only is the movie visually stunning, but the acting is subtle and enhancing. I felt as though Carrey really captured the nuances of his role, which then just even further realized Winslet's character. Not many movies are this daring anymore. The unique order of the film causes the viewer to sit back and allow the images and emotions to wash over them. I highly recommend this film for anyone who still enjoys cinematographic twists and explorations.\n",

      "We all know relationships are problematic.  They must be especially so for Charlie Kaufman, whose screenplay for the 2004 film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, revolves around a steamy relationship gone on the rocks. The film does a good job representing the convolutions of the internal mind of Joel (portrayed by Jim Carrey) as he undergoes a computerized `erasure' of all memory of Clementine, his estranged girlfriend (played by Kate Winslet). It is just the stuff we might expect of the author of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. And these convolutions are convincingly visualized in the dream scenes of director Michel Gondry, thereby giving the film on-screen energy.  But the relationship on which the story is based lacks a sense of veracity, at least in this viewer's mind.No one can say with certainty what energy drives two people into a relationship because no two love stories are the same, a tribute to the complexities of mindset and circumstance. While lust often plays an important early role in a developing relationship, experience teaches that something else must be happening by the time the allure of sex has faded if the relationship is not to die of starvation.So, here we have Joel and Clem, for whom the power of passion has passed. At least it seems to have for Clementine, who undergoes an `erasure' so she can move on from her relationship with Joel.  Discovering he has been so thoroughly dumped, Joel decides he, too, will undergo the erasure procedure. The conflict emerges when Joel gets cold feet mid-procedure and conspires with his memory of Clementine to thwart the erasure even while it is in progress.The screenplay develops many interesting situations out of this clever conceit, thanks to the fertile imaginations of the writers (Kaufman shares writing credit with Gondry and Pierre Bismuth).  But the energy of the relationship between Joel and Clem is never fleshed out, never given a convincing life.  The characters are given human flaws: Joel is shy, can't look strange girls in the eye and has his razor set on `yesterday,' while Clem is capricious and has a weakness for alcohol and weird hair colors. But we never understand what inspired her to throw herself at him, beyond her impulsiveness, or what made her attractive to him, beyond her sitting in his lap.  These may be reasons enough for a tryst, but are unconvincing as motivation for Joel to fight off the erasure.Perhaps it comes down to definitions.  Would you define this film as a bizarre love story or a bizarre story with a love interest?  I believe the love story is more central to film than the bizarre story.  Admittedly, depicting the spark that ignites a relationship is a difficult task. In Eternal Sunshine, the portrayal of the relationship between Joel and Clem is unpersuasive and leads me to find the film flawed for giving the love story insufficient attention.\n",

      "I have been a fan of Man on the Moon, and Adaptation but by no means was I going into this movie with a bias. By the end of the movie it was obvious that I didn't need any type of preference towards Kaufman. The underlying predominant theme of the movie is one of relationship, its beginnings and endings and essentially what things comprise a relationship. The real winning characteristic of this film is contained within the handling of memories and what it would be like to take a closer look. The cast was amazing, and the acting never even came into consideration while watching it. The plot was unique and creative with many subtle and entertaining twists. The filming technique doesn't use a steady cam as is traditional however this is no jumpy \"Blair Witch\" or \"Waking life,\" the camera stays still enough but detached and non static leaving room for things to happen (its really not that bad).  The character dynamics are believable and the chemistry between Winslet and Carrey is made believable by the two actor's obvious understanding of their respective characters. The whole movie was just done so well and if you can bear with it for the fifteen minutes it will be worth every minute and dollar spent. I very rarely get to watch a complete package but I must say I was glad to see another.  10 out of 10\n",

      "We saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind today, just my Love and I. We were both interested in it but hadn't yet had a chance to go. First off, it's a very original, artsy and very well made film. It's just not at all mainstream and I think many people would hate it. It had the surreal feeling of Vanilla Sky and the disorientation of Memento. But it was powerful. Honestly emotional in this way that you could feel it and it made you hurt, down deep in the center of your chest. It's hard to explain. But it was dark and scary almost - this struggle he goes through trying not to lose what he thought he wanted gone. It makes you feel desperate to cling to your own memories and you realize that all those moments - the good, the bad; the ones which make you smile and the ones that make you cry - are all so vital and so much a part of us that losing them would be losing who we are.The film is subtle and blunt at the same time. Scenes are distorted as in dreams and yet vivid and more real then life. You watch these moments; these memories of his and in the film, piece-by-piece of the background and set vanishes or goes blank. You can focus on them and watch slowly at first and then with greater speed, as it all fades out to nothing. You watch it feeling like Joel (Jim Carey pulling off a wonderful dramatic role) himself; trapped in the collapsing house of cards. It evokes a sense of desperation and a darkness more looming and final then death.Came out of it very contemplative. The world outside seemed brighter and full of potential. It's a good movie which makes you not only think, but challenges your perception and place in the world. I like it, and I recommend it, though I can see easily how some - perhaps many - would utterly hate it. It's one of those artistic films that's not so much about a story as it is about an experience.I had to comment on the film while it was fresh in my mind. Huh. That's almost funny. Commenting about having the movie active in my memories when the film is about losing memories. An ironic and unintentional bit of almost humor there.\n",

      "Eternal sunshine struck deep, and I enthusiastically recommend it as an post-modern treatment of an age-old subject, love, who we love and why we love. This film is starkly real, as is much of the film's imagery. The characters are totally human and totally honest. And even though the thing was literally loaded with more-or-less standard symbolism: ocean and sand for emotion and despair, dark, empty house for delving into intimacy, and so on, the camera and editing was so cleverly handled that for me, none of it ever became cliche. Besides, watching it all is just a lot of fun. Seeing Ruffalo and Dunst dancing in their underwear was worth the price of admission alone. I also appreciated that the plot, though not totally straight-forward, was illustrated sufficiently clearly so putting it in order was easy.My favorite part was at the very end when Joel responded to Clementine's submission about her own character. Just the way he said, \"Okay.\" With one word the depth of the need of the sensitive human spirit to \"connect\" with one special beloved person was summed up. Love triumphed when Joel was able to say, okay, and mean it. It was okay to be vulnerable and forgive, for the prospect of companionship.Though Eternal sunshine is about forgetting, I doubt I will.\n",

Honestly, the acting in this film was perfect. Each and every single actor and actress in ESotSM was stellar.

Kaufman's best story, a fantastic cast, beautifully directed, etc. The closest comparison is probably with 'Vanilla Sky' (aka 'Abre Los Ojos'), though this movie delivers much more humor, of a surreal and dark variety (a la 'Being John Malkovich'). If you liked either of these movies, then this is a no brainer. Go see it so that more movies like this will be made!10/10\n",

While I do admit that I do occasionally take in the guilty pleasures of such empty-headed cinema, once in a while a movie comes along that makes me re-examine my budget and go in for a little cerebral entertainment.I loved Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, so when I saw an article on Eternal Sunshine I knew I had to see it. I'm not a fan of Jim's comedy, but I love his serious acting style.I can say that I was wonderfully impressed with this movie, I laughed, I cried and I was totally sucked in.

      "This movie at the beggining can be a little slow. Although many people will leave the theaters not satisfied with the ending they must understand that it is not sopposed to have an ending like, Jim Carrey although depressed lived happily ever after. No! Charlie Kaufman's sreens plays are made in this certain way.  The movie will make sense until the very end, where it doesnt make sense and it makes you watch the entire movie over again in a whole new light. I found this ending to be very similar to Memento in that the ending is telling the viewers that the story will repeat itself over and over.  You have to watch the movie over again in order for the ending to make sense.  Even if you watch it over sometimes it will still not make sense.  I highly suggest this movie for people who want to go to the movies and think when they leave, especially philisopical people.  It really comes down to what is real and what is imagined.  Do not let the commercials trick you it is not that funny of a movie as it is a good movie.

Whilst pondering the ideas of the movie while watching, I was also thinking constantly 'this movie is incredible!'I came to this conclusion (apparently one that many share) about Jim Carey and his role in Eternal Sunshine - it's not what you'd expect. It's not just comedy.

No stereotypes, no cliches, completely three-dimensional characters. Every quirk in each character was completely believable. And Jim Carrey.... after a while you forget it's him you're watching, the mark of a truly gifted actor. I agree with the person who said that this is a movie for the intellectually thirsty. It's definitely one of the more intelligent films to come out in the last couple of months, perhaps one of the three or so smart films Hollywood comes up with each year to tempt those whose wallets will not be snared by crap like Eurotrip.There is really no way to describe this film. It has to be experienced. But I will say, sometimes it's like watching pieces of your own life parading themselves across a movie screen, which is why it disturbed me.

      "You've heard it all already. Jim Carrey's best performance. Oscar-worthy performance by Kate Winslet. Brilliant Love story, blah, blah, blah. It's all true.Director Gondry uses his music video influences in this movie, but not as much as I had expected. The real star here is Charlie Kaufman, the screenwriter. He has crafted a beautiful, flawed, and quirky story full of interesting characters and ideas. Jim Carrey took a huge pay cut just to be in the guy's movie. Carrey got the script, saw that it was a Kaufman script, and accepted immediately. Kaufman is the new Hitchcock in that respect. People don't care what it is or how much they'll get, they just want to be a part of something real. Something different.And, if anything, different is exactly what Charlie Kaufman is. His previous original screenplays, Human Nature with Gondry, Adaptation and Being John Malkovitch with Spike Jonze, are widely recognized as three of the most original stories produced in Hollywood in the past 10 years at least. This movie successfully merges the wonderful weirdness of those three, and incorporates a timeless love story that is as wonderful as it is unconventional.The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was the fact that I came out of the theater aching for love. I'm not the sort of person who shows their feelings on the outside too often, but this one made me smile at everyone I made eye contact with on the long walk back to my place.To me, this movie was the perfect love story, and if you haven't seen it, I suggest you go and judge for yourself.\n",

During the process Carey discovers that he really doesn't want his memories erased, and in an effort to confound the searchers who are searching the database of his mind to erase memories begins to rearrange his memories so that Kate's character appears in unexpected places.The movie is a series of flashbacks, some real, some imagined.  The flashbacks are confusing and dark.This bears no resemblance whatever to the kind of film Jim Carey usually makes.Don't waste your time and money.\n",

      "But now, finally, we get to see it done RIGHT.This is the first film wherein Jim Carrey did not annoy me almost to the point of gouging out my eyes. He was, in fact, surprisingly subdued; off-beat and neurotic without being irritatingly wacky. And, for the first time, I really felt for his character.Though I willingly give Mr. Carrey full marks for acting, I think the main reason I sympathized so much with Joel Barish was because of Charlie Kaufman's writing. I often find Mr. Kaufman's main characters surprisingly familiar (a loser, unlucky in life, unlucky in love, who is caught up in surreality. This is my life to a T), and as such, I feel like I have a personal investment in what happens to them.The story and execution are also quite ingenious, and, more importantly, understated. Plot points are revealed to us subtly; we are not hit over the head with them. It amazes me how rare this is in modern films. My hat's off to Mr. Kaufman.\n",

      "I'm at a loss here to be objective about this movie set in a persons mind simply because as good as it is, I can't get past reality. It begins on a railway platform with commuters waiting to go to work on Valentines Day 2004, which would be nice, except it was a Saturday. While due to circumstances of the plot this could be okay, the problem is that the rest of the film was set in \"real\" places that I know, none of which seemed like the real place. I kept jumping out of the film despite excellent performances, to quibble about the reality of the film. That aside it wasn't a bad movie but more three stars rather than the four that most people are giving it.\n",

People would rather go see a few explosions, fist fights or scantily clad teens than something that is truly thought-provoking and engaging.How can people see an 8.7 (current avg) rating on IMDB and not say \"Hey, I should see that?\"  Do Jesus, Moses, Ganeesh, Buddah and Elvis have to come out and give it a thumbs up before people will go so this?People refuse to believe there is a biological/evolutionary link between humans and apes.  Based on box-office numbers, I'm inclined to agree. Chimps are smarter than most movie-goers.CP.S.

      "It would require an extensive search with a thesaurus to find the words that would accurately describe the merits of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; `impeccable,' `wondrous,' and `incisive' come to mind, though they hardly do this film justice. This is pure movie magic, plain and simple. In fact, anyone who condemns this film on any level with any measure of objectivity is frankly, well, wrong. While one might find little reason to complain about Charlie Kaufman's previous (and equally idiosyncratic) scripts (see Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), at last all the elements of great filmmaking merge perfectly here in what is undeniably a masterpiece (though its hard to top Spike Jonze). Carrey and Winslet both shine, while Michel Gondry's direction (and writing) is exhilarating, hyper, and original -  but never draws too much attention to its own innovations. And that's exactly what this film is: an innovation, one after another. It's rare that a film offers so much of what's fresh and new from so many departments; whether speaking about the tech package (cinematography, editing, and sound design deserve equal props), talent, or the writing, Sunshine fires on all cylinders and is relentless in its pursuit to indulge and entertain us from start to finish. Unlike so many films that struggle with structure and character, Sunshine always offers something unexpected in character and plot development. Equally rare in movies these days are twists that are both unexpected and meant to be, that leave no aftertaste of contrivance whatsoever, and Sunshine is full of them. There wasn't a single moment, even for a split second, where I remembered I was in fact sitting in a theatre and not on that cold, snowy beach in Montauk with two characters that remain just as fascinating even as I write this days later. Suffice to say that Sunshine gripped me and never let go, as any great film should. What makes it stand out, and stand alone, however, are the numerous innovations that Gondry employs to extrapolate the complex, fractured, and dreamlike narrative. More importantly, Kaufman's script predicates and demands such innovation (SPOILER ALERT!) since much of the film takes place within the decaying memories of Carrey's mind; and the fact that Gondry and company pulled it off so perfectly is really quite an accomplishment. Thematically as well, Sunshine somehow finds new ground in the oldest and most familiar genre: the love story. But instead of the conventional 'free-spirit-meets-conformist-and-they-fall in-love-and-ironically-complement-each-other-perfectly' type of romance, Winslet's character tells us exactly what we've always wanted to hear but never have before: `Joel, I'm not a concept. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a f***ed up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.' Finally a love story not about two opposites, but between two people who are perfect for each other, and like any real life love story, it's often the perfect match that results in the most confusion, the most pain, and the most work to remain happy.\n",

      "Michel Gondry brings Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet together for a dark, eccentric and powerful film that no one should miss. Their rewarding performance along with the crafted screenplay and twists and turns make this film worth seeing more than once. Most films are so shallow they only last their glimmer for one view. However, Eternal Sunshine is a jewel. The more you see it, the more you get out of it. The entire film is a portrayal of the journey of the mind, life, and the center of its being. A truly inspiring film, and one that should be adored and loved as a centerpiece of this journey. It teaches more than it pleases. While Jim Carrey is a comedy man, he is incredibly apt to take this role. A must-see. 10/10.\n",

      "I went to this because Adaptation was one of my favorites of 2002 & it's rare that a US movie engages me. If you go to Hollywood movies all the time, then you might find the way in which this story is told to be engaging enough to distract you from the film's lack of content. But if you're a more seasoned film buff, you'll probably find this one-trick wonder to be a bit of a bore. The film falls apart under the weight of its own slickness. About 1/2 way through the film, when the film became nothing more than Carey trying to evade the \"erasers\" in his mind,  I was paying more attention to how bad the acting was. Mark Ruffalo & Kirsten Dunst are particularly bad. So if there's nothing but Hollywood fare available you might check it out, but otherwise save your $$$.\n",

I guess that says how i feel for the movie.  A Masterpiece and i rarely use the word.  The most original, striking, mind blowing and well acted movie since Fight Club.  The acting is superb, Jim Carrey has proven himself as an actor.  What a moving, emotional and touching portrayal he does of the character Joel.  Same goes for my favorite actress Kate Winslet, her best performance yet.  She simply can do no wrong for me.  The rest of the cast is superb from Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffolo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst.  Michel Gondry has made a film that should be marveled at for years to come, i applaud him for that.

      "(Minor plot spoilers within)I always liked charlie kaufman. hes a smart intelligent writer who thinks outside the box more than any other writers in entertainment today. I went into eternal sunshine with an open mind and high expectations. it lived up to those expectations in ways i could never imagine. the film's plot consists of Joel having his ex-grilfriend, clementine, erased from his memory. almost the entire movie is inside of joel's head. every once in a while we see the people who are working on his mind but it's mostly joel's memories. joel procedes to relive his memories as they are being erased. this movie will confuse you, as it did me. it will all make sense at the end. it has a few funny parts. one scene comes to mind where joel is trying to take clementine into another memory so she won't be erased. he brings her back to when he was a 4-year old. shes his baby sitter. joel acts as a mixture of himself and his 4-year old self to make a very entertaining and funny scene. the little things i nthe scene like him not being able to reach the fridge handle, being bathed in the sink, wanting ice cream and cookies, make the scene worthwile. anyways, this is the best movie of the year so far and i dont expect it to be beaten. go see it. it doesnt get much better than this. it will make you sad. it will make you happy. most of all, it will warm your heart.\n",

      "'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a jewel, or an orchid - a rare, precious find to be kept and cherished (or nourished). It is a film more akin to a small, adventurous and daring European production then to a major Hollywood release. The film seems to stem its influences mostly from two brilliant, young Spanish directors Alejandro Amen√°bar and Julio Medem. Conceptually, its slight romantic Sci-Fi blend recalls Amen√°bar's bravura tour de force 'Open Your Eyes' (aka 'Vanilla Sky'). Its elliptical story telling, its flight of fancy is Julio Medem's trademark ('Sex and Lucia','Tierra'). This is in no way to diminish the film's authenticity, creativity and originality. In no way. 'Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind' is a fresh, innovative piece of work that we have grown to crave in the barren, fruitless landscape of Hollywood cookie-cutter movies.It is just the movie one would expect from the production companies named Blue Ruin, This Is That Productions, Anonymous Content - companies that have treated us with this small but remarkable movie.The movie is a creative pinnacle in writer Charlie Kaufman's ('Being John Malcovich', 'Adaptation') career, and pushes him to the forefront of creative Hollywood.'Adaptation' was to be all about the beauty, about the mystic of flowers, namely orchids. In it, Charlie Kaufman agonizes to find ways of adopting Susan Orlean's plot less book into a successful script without the help of Hollywood's screenplay guru Robert McKee's Ten Commandments. Halfway through the movie, Charlie gives in, attends one of McKee's writing seminars, adopts his formulas (conflict is clearly defined, a gun is introduced, an obligatory chase scene takes place, etc) and Charlie finally finishes his story. Unfortunately, it was not the story that we were (mis) led to expect for most of the movie. What was not achieved in 'Adaptation', creatively speaking, was brilliantly pulled off in 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'. With it, and in it, Charlie Kaufman finally finds her - his 'Ghost Orchid'! He also finds a niche in Hollywood entirely of his own - a rare accomplishment indeed!Jim Carrey is a perfect cast. In the aftermath, it is hard to imagine anyone else playing an introverted, lonely, and worn-looking Joel Barish. His manic energy subdued, his mannerism toned down, his trademark zaniness nowhere to be found, Here he completely reinvents himself. Kate Winslet, in another perfect cast, plays Clementine, a free-spirited, bohemian young woman who storms into Joel's life. Opposites attract, but there are thorns on the road to Happiness. When the going gets tough, you go for a radical solution. Enters Lacuna, a Memory Erasure Institute. The main thrust of the story is when Joel, in the middle of his treatment to permanently erase memories of Clementine, decides that he somehow wants some of his memories preserved.That the movie skillfully zigzags through time and alternate realities is much to the credit of the French movie director Michel Gondry. A veteran music video director, he turns out to have been ideally suited to capture film's quirky, offbeat sensibilities.The film's rare flow is the bizarre characterization of Lacuna's employees, otherwise expertly played by Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst. If Charlie Kaufman succeeded in subduing his early screen writing eccentricities (the way Jim Carrey did with his acting), the film would have been quite a bit more accomplished and far more acceptable to wider audiences.'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is an old-fashioned romance, infused with Generation X sensibilities and artificial/alternate reality special effects. It is, in essence, boy-meets-girl, boy-looses-girl and tries to get her back, time-honored formula with soft Sci-Fi axis the movie whirls around. The film is more likely to appeal to VH1 than to MTV audiences. And it is very likely to have a substantial foreign success.Way to go, Charlie! Bravo Gondry!\n",

      "If you thought that Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Human Nature were all just luck, maybe this one will prove you wrong. Following up his best commercially successful film to date, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine does not disappoint. Besides a brilliant plot and storyline, Kauffman and Gondry team up to provide another truly original film with creative editing, shots, and casting. Jim Carrey once again proves that he can hold his own in dramatic roles, and Kate Winslett provides a perfect counter balance. They don't dress her up too pretty and she pulls off being a 'normal' girl (better than Diaz in Being John).  I don't really think that Kirsten Dunst's role was necessary at all, it seems like that part of the storyline was added at the end to appease the studio and provide some twist and conflict. I thought the movie was so emotional that it didn't need to end any other way. Then again, it seems that Kauffman's movies always contain some superfluous female roles (maybe he can't write women well), remember Julia Roberts in Dangerous Mind.\n",

You'll fall in love with the faults of the characters and even their falling out of love.And maybe you'll look at yourself and see a glimmer of your own romantic sabotages, desperations and mistakes; and realize that there's hope.

And digital (computer assisted) filmmakers in the next 20 years will point to this film as inspiration. Subtle, subtle stuff, but very, very effective. Just watch the reversing street scene early on! Or how like an impressionistic painting things are as the background blurs in different ways at different points. Also brilliant use of lighting throughout the film.And Jim Carrey makes the film, never going over the top, always hitting just the right note. (Esp at the end of the film as his last memory is being washed away.) A thousand thousand fanboys will fall in love with the character of Clementine - girls, start dyeing your hair.If ever a small picture deserved the studio push for the best picture Oscar, this is it.

      "This movie is a must see. It's the best movie I have seen in a while. It has the exciting plot of Memento, the heart of a fantastic Drama, wonderful comedy moments, and really spectacular acting. I went in expecting an interesting movie, something exciting that would make me think, and what I got was a fantastic film. Jim Carrey gives a subtle wonderful performance, and Kate Winslet is the most captivating romantic heroine ever. Gondry gets beautiful moments out of every scene, and Elijah Wood is refreshing as a dopey character for once. I personally am tired of him always being so cutesy. I'm not one to go into the particulars, but I want to stress that this movie is a perfect combination of thought and feeling. It manages to break your heart, inspire you, make you laugh, and surprise you all at the same time, and it is a very very difficult thing to accomplish that in a film.

      "Seeing Eternal Sunshine created a drunken experience which I haven't had, when I've been sober, before. This film gave me a smile which lasted two hours. Winslet's Clementine powered the movie projector with her electricity, and Carrey's subdued Joel was an everyman that even Tom Hanks or Jimmy Stewart couldn't pull off.

I must say that this is one of the most brilliant  movies I have ever seen.  At first, I thought it would be difficult to accept Jim Carrey in a  serious role, but he was GREAT.  I think Kate Winslet gave an oscar-worthy performance.  The art direction is like nothing else I've ever seen.  Miraculously, Michel Gondry manages to  convey onto film the kinds of surreal yet confusing images and sequences that can normally  be seen only in the most obscure and strangest of dreams.  At times, I felt as though parts of  my own dreams were being projected onto the big screen for all to see.  This film is absolutely brilliant, worthy of a best-picture nomination.\n",

Who would have ever thought that Jim Carrey would give a \"haunting\" performance?  This film has way more heart than \"Adaptation\" or \"Being John Malkovitch.\"  I am actually amazed that this film wasn't released during the Oscar buzz months.  It's stronger than \"Lost in Translation\" (the last breakout hit from Focus) and, as a matter of fact, probably one of the best films I've ever seen.  I would feel a lot better about America if a film like this was doing the business that \"Passion\" was doing, and vice-versa. DO NOT MISS IT!!\n",
      "1674\n",
      "The nice thing about this collaboration between French video ace Michel Gondry and head-trip screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is that it's so sad and human. The sci-fi games and convoluted cleverness don't get in the way of a basic evocation of the messy, ambivalent end of an intense affair. Jim Carrey - more ordinary and believable than usual - and Kate Winslet - as vivid and beautiful as always - somehow emerge from all the stylized modernistic craziness looking and feeling very much like a painfully real couple of lovers.We don't know what the chronology is till later but it goes backward. The opening scenes of Carrey meeting Winslet in the Montauk train station have great vividness. She is too quirky and forward and he is too shy and hangdog. They fall in love. The centerpiece is a visit to a sleazy local brain mechanic who erases memories. Kate's character has already done it to eliminate Jim. He goes to end his suffering by having her excised. The conceit we are to accept is that while asleep or drugged for the brainwash Carrey's character has second thoughts and concentrates mightily to reverse everything. At the end we find that he hasn't quite succeeded. They've forgotten each other. But they manage to meet and fall in love a second time and that's the sequence with which the movie has begun.The story is nothing if not intricate. In its sequencing of scenes, it's arguably more complicated than any of Kaufman's other filmed screenplays. But the focus is on the simple, familiar experiences of lovers: falling, fighting, parting, second thoughts, trying to forget, trying to remember. The sc-fi part is a metaphor for all that.This package may be too tricky and scary to make a great date movie for the average couple, but anybody's memories of lost loves - and the longing to bring them back -- can very easily be teased out by watching Joel and Clementine's ordeal. In the filmmakers' neat blend of conceptual and emotional, tricky theoretical stuff is planted in your mind embodied in the busy succession of intense, funny-depressing everyday scenes. While we're watching events inside Joel's brain as he's in his bed being \"treated\" by the Lacuna company's memory erasers, we see books and walls and even faces go blank as the erasing takes effect, while Joel and Clem frantically scramble away to save themselves from the faded memory and reassemble somewhere in the mind where the technicians won't look. It's a vivid evocation of how memories fade and how we struggle to keep emotions and images alive when a relationship has lost its freshness in real time.\n",
      "The result is as clever as it is touching. The strong secondary characters, the amiable quack doctor played by Bill Wilkinson, the bespectacled technician Fink (Mark Ruffalo), the fawning secretary (Kirsten Dunst) and the assistant called Patrick who's trolling for Joel's girl (Elijah Wood) keep the love story from ever seeming solipsistic, or even beautiful. Or for that matter, even important: Joe's home brainwashing session, from the point of view of Fink, Patrick, and Miss Dunst, is little more than an occasion to engage in their own shenanigans. In a way these characters are like the buffoons that hover around the periphery of tragic heroes in a Shakespeare play to keep its doings from being too formal or too solemn for us groundlings.The Gondry-Kaufman collaboration is at least as effective as the Jonze-Kaufman and Clooney-Kaufman ones. But shenanigans aside, is it fun? More like pleasing torture, it seems. A message board contributor calls it \"a headache. A beautiful, inspiring, addictive headache.' Somebody else writes that `old people' (probably anybody over 40) `hate' the movie. `Young people,' who `love' it, get excited trying to figure it out. What tape was Joel throwing out of the car in that early scene? they ask. Does Clem pursue Joel differently the second time from the first? Above all, how could Clementine's message in a dream during Joel's brainwashing to `meet me in Montauk' work?You don't have to be young to love this movie, but you may have to be a bit naive to worry much over such questions. It's just a movie - and an unusually farfetched one - but what makes it so good is the way the couple's emotions feel so genuine throughout, not how all the story elements gibe. Some of them may not. Gondry confirms their reality memorably however by banishing Matrix gloss in favor of a conceptual world that's as drab and clunky looking as American Splendor's, but enriched by Kaufman's conceptual tricks and a surprising mix of humor and sadness. A superb film, and some of its stars' best work.  It's impossible to do justice to it in any description, though much good stuff has already been written.  Just see it.\n",

Complex film, but very touching and sad with splashes of Kaufman humor.  If you've ever been lovelorn, then this film will tug at your heart.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is incredibly original and is by far the best turn Jim Carry has ever given. Oscar race has already begun and I'm pulling for Sunshine in 2005.  I must say I was a little hesitant after seeing \"Human Nature\", but Gondry pulls it off with such grace and brilliance.  With \"Nature\" the promise was big and the payoff was weak.  With \"Sunshine\", well, I think the title of the film speaks for itself.  10 out of 10.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", from director Michel Gondry, ask the question that while you can erase someone from your memory, can you remove them from your heart? It is also the first entry into the \"Oscar friendly\" category of movies, and the expectations are very high going in. Would the film be able to live up to such expectations? A resounding yes, and then some.Jim Carrey stars as Joel Barish, a lonely middle aged man who is awe struck to find out that his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) has had all memory of him erased from her brain. In a knee jerk reaction, he agrees to have the same process done of her. However, half way through the process Joel decides that he doesn't want to forget Clementine and attempts to fight back. Most of the film consists of a retrospective look back at the good and bad times of their rocky relationship, through Joel's eyes. Joining Winslet and Carrey are Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson, who play the staff of Lacuna Inc., the company that carry out the procedure. The film goes back and forth between the conscious realm in which Lacuna is eliminating Joel's memories and inside his brain.Words cannot describe the emotional rollercoaster that one undergoes while watching \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". It is a brilliantly blended mix of comedy, drama, romance and suspense. Jim Carrey does well by this as the star, finally giving a completely solid dramatic performance. Unlike 1998's \"The Truman Show\" in which Jim Carrey's slapstick was a drain on the film itself, there is something to be admired for his dead pan delivery in this film. Instead of trying to impress the audience by overacting, he is very poignant and the scenes that are supposed to be very meaningful are successful.Kate Winslet is perhaps the most talented actress in Hollywood, and continues to impress in this supporting role. She plays the free spirited almost modern day hippy character with complete perfection. It is amazing to watch her transform from happy and energetic one moment to raving lunatic the next. Hopefully justice is done next February and she can finally get that Oscar of hers. Don't worry Kate, fourth time's a charm I've heard!The acting is obviously superb in this movie, but Michel Gondry's unconstrained and experimentative directing is also worth noting. His use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handycam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. I can't describe exactly what he did, but it was highly successful. It seemed as if you were inside the characters head.On the whole, this is one of the best films ever made. I'm not sure how high it is yet, it will take time and more viewings, but it is definitely one fantastic movie. I'm sitting here trying to find ways it could have been better, but I can't. It was really the absolute best this film could possibly have been. When you take an interesting concept and make a flawless film, you get one movie that has pretty much rendered next year's Oscars more or less irrelevant.***** (A+) (9.5/10)\n",

      "-By Brad BaerBaerFoot ReviewsThe movie opens with Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) getting out of bed, clearly disappointed about the days work ahead of him. We hear his voiceover on why Valentine's Day was created by greeting card companies; Joel, as we will come to find out, has separated from his girl. Joel decides, to reasons he cannot explain in his voiceover, that he is going to call in sick and go to the beach. Walking on the beach he meets Clementine Kruczynski; (Kate Winslet) we are surprised to see someone else there since it is winter. What follows then is the most awkward beginning to a relationship that I have ever seen. They fight as if they have had a history together. Foreshadowing?I will not fill in the gaps for I do not want to give away any more of the movie. What follows though, is a heartwarming love story that is sure to leave you in awe, once again, of Kaufman's story telling. Some will rate this as one of the best romantic movies of all time, some will look towards it to strengthen their own relationships, and some will call it unrealistic and point out its flaws. The genius of this movie is that we will all walk away with different theories; I took `love conquers all' from it.Charlie Kaufman has quickly become a favorite of mine; first with Being John Malkovich, then with the highly underrated Human Nature, then Adaptation, and now this. I cannot wait for his new project with Spike Jones, the director of Adaptation and Malkovich.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a surprisingly warm hearted story that stays true to Kaufman's imaginative story telling. This movie is perhaps his most brilliant work to date; it leaves me wanting more of his ingenious style.Charlie Kaufman has done it again.\n",

      "Gondry really did a good job with this movie. He used his individual techniques to make the movie flow from shot to shot flawlessly. Great story and characters. The music that was used also helped the movie go along well. Polyphonic Spree's and ElO's music really went well with the movie. I think Gondry's good use of music can be traced back to his experience with Bjork and The White Stripes videos he's done along with many others. Jim Carey did a really great job with his character. I easily identified with him and really appreciated how Gondry allowed the character to be serious and comical at the same time. It definitely deserves its place in the top 250.\n",

I must say that this movie isn't for everyone, but to those of us who can appreciate the nuances and complexities of a serious relationship, it is an instant classic. For those of you with short attention spans, steer clear of this one as there are a seemingly endless stream of scenes involving Joel's (Jim Carrey) memories in the middle section of the film. Even I, a strong advocate of the film, began to grow weary with these scenes, and only after the film had resolved realized their vast importance to the whole of the film. I can't promise that every viewer will see this in the same way that I did.\n",
      "Kate Winslet was absolutely fantastic as Clementine. I nearly fell in love with her while watching the movie, despite the fact that her character had serious issues. Her character craved love and all I wanted to do was give it to her (you can take that any way you want). Jim Carrey was great for the part, yet interestingly it wasn't the same Jim Carrey that we all know from Ace Ventura, and The Mask. He was massively toned down in this movie, showing no traces of his trademark acting style (believe me, this is a good thing). This made his character all the more believable. The two of them worked surprisingly well as passionate lovers who descend into the relationship hell of resentment and jealousy.  The film shows how time truly destroys all things as even the most passionate of relationships can and will erode eventually. Yet the most striking message that the movie portrays is the power of memory and the incredible effect that it has on the human psyche, because although we grow old and all things come to an end, it is the memories in life that define us, who we were, and who we loved.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman's writing is always clever, but this time he's one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but 'Eternal Sunshine' manages to dazzle you (or anyway, it dazzled me) with it's originality and it's poignancy.  The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.Everything fit.  The acting was wonderful, and my girlfriend said as we were leaving that she felt like crying at the end, but wasn't quite sure why. It didn't matter.  The actors knew why, and they were able to communicate it. But even the choices in the camera work and editing - from bizarre and near-constant jumpcuts to a perpetually wandering focus - supported the story and intent of the film, where so often techniques like that are used simply for the sake of using them.The movie's not perfect (I got the impression that Elijah Wood's part was significantly cut down; it seemed to start something interesting but not finish), but 'Eternal Sunshine' is an extremely well-made, resonant movie, that, if nothing else, is an example of how the style of a movie can underscore and even elevate its content.\n",

      "I LOVED this movie, and I don't say that about many movies.  It's a movie for anyone that's ever been in love and even for those that have become hardened by love's disappointing nature.  Not \"Hollywood's version\" of love, but really felt a genuine connection with someone...the doubting, the questioning, the passion and emotion...then had it all dashed by a devastating break up.  I left the theater remembering my own relationships and how dark and unique they have all been.  The secrecy and stifled screams of the heart.  Carrey is brilliant and doesn't pull any of his usual physical comedy stunts or famous 'one-liners', his image is matured in this film and Winslet is as deep and beautiful as always.  Credit goes where credit is due...Kaufman is a genius.\n",
      "1683\n",
      "I had high expectations as I prepared to see this film, driven by two factors.  First, I was very impressed with the originality of Kaufman's Being John Malkovich.  Second, I have thoroughly enjoyed Kate Winslet's excellent performances in several previous films, most notably Heavenly Creatures.  Perhaps it was the shattering of these high, but realistic, expectations that made watching this film so disappointing.This was the first time in a couple of years that I considered walking out of the theatre (twice).  After an hour, enough of a plot framework had developed that it was no longer necessary to invest significant effort in following the story.  Furthermore, a couple of comparatively interesting subplots developed: although they are variations on the main plot, they involve more appealing characters.The acting was acceptable but unremarkable; Winslet and Carrey are both capable of better.  The cinematography and editing were garish, and seemed to be designed to distract the audience from the hollow characters.\n",
      "There are a few funny and emotive scenes towards the end.  However, their impact quickly faded, and I was left with nothing to think about as I left (except, where did my 13 bucks just go?).  If you like original, artistic, and intelligent films, it is possible that this will appeal to you, but be warned: it is not BJM.\n",

      "*May contain spoilers. Not since Polanski's (1994)\"Bitter Moon\" has a film captured the delirious, terrifying, humiliating, and ultimately addictive experience of love. Joel and Clementine meet, fall passionately in lust, then procede to pick apart and destroy one-another. (Never happened to you? You might want to skip this film.) When flaky and impulsive Clementine decides to erase her memory of Joel, the brooding jilted lover reacts in turn. (That'll show her!)He soon regrets his decision. Along his journey, he learns that with all its flaws, love-- like life itself-- is something we cling desperately to, when it's about to be snatched from us. Will Joel and Clem be doomed to repeat their dysfunctional tango, or will they emerge wiser than the rest of us? Hard to say, but I've got my fingers crossed.Director Gondry's scenes are a Dali-esque dream, achingly beautiful and hallucinatory. Winslet is a revelation. Carrey, who was robbed of Oscar recognition for The Truman Show, simply cannot be denied. The supporting cast are uniformly engaging. Must see. Again.\n",

      "This is surely one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time. Too profound to be actually described by words.If you basically look beyond the technicalities of the movie, you will see a beautiful recreation of what happens inside the minds of everyone of us.Joel(Jim Carrey) finds out that his girlfriend Clementine(Kate Winslet) has,after their unsuccessful relationship, erased his memories from her life. Shocked and disillusioned, he seeks to do the same. But the entire ordeal becomes some sort of a revelation for him. The entire movie runs in Joel's memories...wherein at one point he doesn't want to let go off Clementine. How he tries to evade the erosion...and the subsequent realization..is what makes the entire movie an absolute treat.The editing is simply breathtaking. Reminds you of \"Pi\"(Darren Aronofsky) and his style. Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances after \"The Truman Show\" and Kate Winslet adds a very enigmatic touch to the entire plot.Don't expect too much though from the other cast. They are somewhat wasted for the amount of name they carry. But then..this movie is not about the cast and the script. Its more about the experience. Its more about the essential question..\"If something didn't go wrong..would you rather erase it...or live with it\"You have to see this to believe it. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is not your standard happy cinema movie. Its the one which makes you think and reflect. If you like this kind of stuff...there is no way this will disappoint you.\n",
      "1686\n",
      "The film is thought provoking and sparked a lot of post-theater discussion. Part of that discussion was a final working out of what was memory, and what was switching back and forth in time. I see this as one of Carrey's works that the general public won't like because he's not being funny. It's intellectual like Truman and also confusing. However Carrey is more than a characature. All those hours making faces in front of the mirror yielded an amazing ability to convey despair, vulnerability, loss, delight, etc., etc., etc. One thing I'm interested in. All of Joel's drawings look like the work of R.Crumb. In the \"humiliation\" scene, Joel is occupied with a comic book that must be one of R. Crumb's adult comics.\n",

      "Even if you don't like Jim Carrey, this movie will amaze you.In Traveling through the mind of Joel Barish you find something that is much less complicated then the storyline, love. This movie proves the old saying \"It is better to have loved and lost then to have never loved at all\". With an original and interesting story with great acting, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is oscar bound. The camera work alone deserves many awards. So, help this wonderful ,yet very underadvertised movie and see it.Definitely Jim Carrey's best work.,Lucas\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004). **** out of ****This is one of the most orginal, mind boggling movies in years (possibly the most original movie ever). Jim Carrey (the best performance of his career, by far) plays Joel Barish, a work a day loner (the kind of man who wonders \"Why do I fall in love with every woman I see that shows me the least bit of attention?\") who for reasons unknown skips off work and takes the train to Montauk, NY, where he meets the free spirited Clementine (the always reliable Kate Winslet, in a career best performance). After a train ride full of mini-disagreements and unwanted compliments, Clementine and Joel hit it off and end their morning with Clemintine inviting herself to spend the day at Joel's apartment. As Joel is waiting for Clemintine to pick up her toothbrush from her apartment, a young man asks him why he is there......... And that is all I will say about this brilliant movie. I will not reveal anything else about the plot because to do so will spoil the complete originality of this movie. This is one of the most orginal movies I have ever seen (on par with \"Memento\", \"Donnie Darko\" and \"Being John Malkovich\"). Do yourself a favour and see this movie.............just don't go in trying to predict what you're going to see\n",

      "Barring certain multi-part oddities (The Matrix sequels, the eleven hour film known as The Lord of the Rings), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the best film I've seen since the wondrous days of 1999.  I've seen many reviews comment on the brain bending aspect of the pic, but I really don't see it as the stereotypical Charlie Kaufman head-scratcher.  Brain-bender? Eh, maybe.  Heartbreaker?  Definitely.  The raw emotion on display in this film is staggering, notably from the two leads and Kirsten Dunst, displaying a fragility and vulnerability that just melts your heart in sympathy for her poor, shattered character.  I don't generally care about the awards season madness that grips Hollywood each winter, but I'll be mightily distressed if this Sunshine doesn't shine over them all next year.  In the age of \"waiting for the DVD\", I've driven 50 miles to the theater for this one twice this week, and will likely go again in a few days.  If you love movies, you MUST go see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\n",

      "This is film making at its best. The acting was awesome (even from Kirsten Dunst), the editing and directing incredible, and it had one of the best stories I've ever heard. It's really not a comedy, although there are funny parts, there is no real genre under which this film can be classified. This type of movie only comes once every ten years. It deserves many an Oscar, especially one for writing, directing, editing, and cinematography. Everyone in the world should go see this movie...a few words of advice, do not find out anything about it before you go, don't look at plot summaries, reviews (if you are reading this one, stop, step away from your computer, and go buy a ticket), and ABOVE ALL do not talk to any of your friends about it before going to see it. The best part of this movie is discovering it for yourself. Another piece of advice, go see this movie with someone you love, it will make it ten times better.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman's movies are known for being a little off-kilter and are often surprisingly full of little life-lessons and questions to ponder. Having enjoyed his previous films and feeling elated by the cast of Eternal Sunshine, I went to the theatre fully expecting to enjoy the movie. I was pleasantly surprised to find it one of the most moving films I've seen in recent months/years/etc.The premise of the film requires you to suspend disbelief just a bit. First Clementine and then Joel, having had a particularly tumultuous relationship, decide to have their memories of the other person erased in a special procedure performed in their homes by Dr. Mierwiak & his cohorts from Lacuna, Inc. We know that this is virtually impossible, but Kaufman wisely doesn't really explain how it works, other than some vague information about memory mapping and the like. We sort of forget that it really doesn't make much sense and just accept it.When the movie opens, Joel and Clementine meet on a train coming back from Montauk. There is a strange vibe between them, each of them seeming to feel a sense of deja vu that they have perhaps met before. Clementine assumes she's seen Joel in the bookstore where she works. They hit it off, and she is on her way home with him, when Kaufman jerks us back in time. From then, we see Joel decide to retaliate to Clementine having had her memories of him erased by doing the same. He makes his appointment at Lacuna, and Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo show up to conk him out and clear his mind of Clementine.For the rest of the film, we are part of a thrilling, heartwarming race through Joel's mind as his memories of Clementine are recalled and erased one by one, starting with the most recent and painful memories and working backwards to the more beautiful and touching memories. As Joel takes this journey and examines each memory (progressively becoming more beautiful), he begins to doubt his decision to have Clementine banished from his mind and tries to fight the procedure. It's both tragic and exciting, and I found myself rooting for Joel, hoping he could keep at least some tiny part of Clementine alive in his mind. The movie then returns us to where we were at the beginning; Joel and Clementine are faced with an interesting situation not long after their re-introduction on the train that calls everything into question. Are the bad times worth the potential good times? Can people change? Can memories truly be erased?Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are all impressive as the Lacuna employees working on Joel and finding things out about themselves along the way. Dunst's obsession with Dr. Mierzwiak leads to a surprising unveiling of truth that catapults the movie's final act. Ruffalo is adorable and pitiable as the nice guy who can't quite get the girl. Wood ventures down a new career path in a decidedly sad and creepy role, stealing Joel's memories in order to woo Clementine for his own.Jim Carrey has finally come into his own here. As Joel, he is - perhaps for the first time in history - NOT Jim Carrey. In fact, I forgot for the entire film that he was Jim Carrey, which was so nice, especially when he did one scene as a small child and still managed to use new, never-before-seen tactics and avoid the usual Carrey-isms. It was wonderful and refreshing, and I think he achieved the acting status he's been looking for and nearly found with The Truman Show and Man on the Moon. In this movie, he's introspective, sad, quiet, withdrawn, misunderstood and frustrated. I felt for him at every turn and was thrilled at the end when he is given a second chance.Kate Winslet, as always, was divine. She captured Clementine, a difficult, impulsive, moody woman, and over the course of two hours convinced me not to hate her, but rather to fall in love with her, just as Joel does all over again. Her personality seemed to change as often as her hair colors (which all looked fantastic on her, actually). I have long thought that she was one of the most fabulous actresses working in Hollywood, and this might be yet another year in which people take note of her talents.What I loved most about the movie was that it really made you think - no matter how bad some memories are, would you ever want to forget someone? Would you be the same person if you could? Isn't it perhaps better to remember the painful things in order to be able to fully appreciate the positive things? I love the fact that, even though Joel and Clementine really do some terrible damage to each other, we still want to see them take another stab at it...which seems indicative of the fact that, even at our worst, we all have worth and can perhaps do better if given another chance. And if there isn't another chance, at least we can remember the good along with the bad and hopefully come away stronger.9/10\n",

      "Movies are designed to speak to people, for them to relate to.  While most of those movies are made to have people relate to extreme or common to all folks this movie speaks to a select few.   But it does so with such respect, such brilliance and such beauty that it is hard not to be moved by its message.Let me first say that I have hated every Jim Carrey movie with the exception of The Truman Show, I don't like slapstick prat falls, and funny faces and his normal over the top act.  In this film it is amazing how well he depicts someone believable.   He is both sad and happy, hurt but strong and he is willing to give up pieces of himself for another that he loves.\n",
      "Scenes where he is back into childhood are so beautiful and unexpected, we all think if we could go back and confront the bully with our current mind we would \"not be afraid of them\" but they still prevail.  And while given several opportunities to be very \"Jim Carrey\" he is tender and understated.\n",
      "As far as Kate Winslet, I have admittedly only seen one film with her in it \"Titanic\" and her other Artsy films did not make my VCR or eyes.  She, aside from being beautiful is truly believable.  She is able to be both hated and loved in the same breath.   You can see that she is a good person with problems,  not evil.I am not going to jump on the supporting cast support bandwagon on this film as I found them to be very much in the background. While good they were necessary components to make the film work.I think this performance which has been well liked by most people who see it, and liked by most critics may be a surprise Oscar hit next year like the Piano was.   Jim Carrey defiantly deserves a nomination and Michel Gondry should get at least a best Writing Nod.Worth seeing, worth thinking about, and most of all worth remembering.5 out of 5 *'s\n",

      "** Some Spoilers **This movie is fantastic.  It addresses some of the great questions of human existence in a really thoughtful, subtle way.  In my opinion the whole ending sequence is masterful, and actually gives an answer where so many movies cop-out and just end.  I think the people that get caught up in the \"they still found each other\" aspect, or get upset that they're so \"needy\" to stay together at the end really miss the point.To attentive moviewatchers it will become clear at some point that the beginning of the movie was actually the second meeting between JC and KW. Once you realize that, a whole set of questions form in your mind - will their relationship follow the same course, will they develop the same problems and feelings toward each other?  But then, at the very end, Kaufman takes you to another level where you realize that these questions are silly and pointless.  The real question is what is human life?  What role does memory play in defining your life?  Even if you knew a relationship was going to turn out badly, does that mean that it isn't worth living for all those great times?  Are those great times what make your life?  And aren't the bad times as well?  And if you destroy those memories, aren't you really destroying a part of yourself?I think it was Kaufman's best script yet.  It doesn't beat you over the head was some really deep themes, so I think some people will miss them.  But it's all there.\n",

      "Outstanding film. Rough edges, but that only adds to the effect (of memory loss). It's a film that teaches and its lesson is right on. It doesn't preach though. The lesson is subtle, but direct. It is a great gift for a relationship between normally conflict-avoidant people to begin on realistic terms, airing their complaints and weaknesses even as the romance begins. What a concept.The film asks the question of broken people: would you go back and erase in your life what broke you? If you could change that situation that debilitated you, or that abuse, would you? And if we think hard enough, the question gives us pause. What if we had listened to our parents instead? What if we could have made the wise decision that we avoided before, perhaps because of the prospect of something more exciting, but flat out stupid?\n",
      "What if we had listened to our parents?Carrey may finally be making some movement as an actor in this film. It's him still, but he seems to be maturing a little. There is some talent under all that flagellation.I recommend it highly.\n",

      "Having waited months for this to come out, I feared an anti climax.This film is, however, fantastic. It is without doubt the best Romance I have ever seen, if in fact it can be classified as such. I am at a loss as to how Charlie Kaufman creates such amazing, compelling, intricate, clever and engaging films.Jim Carrey deserves the highest of praise for such a fantastic performance, lost in a dark world of his own memories. I have great respect for the man. Kate Winslet also put in an amazing performance as the unstable, impulsive and insecure Clementine.I think the thing I loved most about this film was I could watch it and enjoy every moment, safe in the knowledge that the genius that is Kaufman would pull the whole film together right in front of my eyes, effortlessly turn everything on its head and leave me with a sense of completion and something to spend the next week thinking about.There are too many memorable scenes to count and I don't wish to spoil any part of it. I do however love the scene within his memories in the library.So, in a word, brilliant, end to end.\n",

      "This movie tells a simple story of a man discovering that even bad events are worth remembering and/or have some good memories worth remembering. In order to extend this simple concept to a feature length movie, the timeline and storytelling is broken up and mixed up to form a jigsaw in order to make it more difficult to piece together. The hopes is that when you finally get the whole story you'll be amazed and appreciate it more. Not a chance.In Memento, the broken up story served a purpose and each scene added value making the style effective. In this movie, most of the scenes are boring, add little value and the crazy camera work and broken timeline distract from the story and the message. Jim Carey's performance was excellent and the viewer can quickly relate to and understand his character. Although normally this would be a benefit to a movie, here we are tortured into viewing his character's obvious self-discovery in a style that makes you nauseated and frustrated. I think most of Americans are so starved for non-hollywood type movies that they are unable to distinguish total useless crap from a true effective artistic story.I can always make the wasted money up, but the time spent watching my clock and praying for a quick ending is lost forever.\n",

      "I was almost afraid to see this film knowing its subject matter... but I finally caved in, b/c I loved Adaptation so much I own the DVD. Practically EVERYONE has been in this situation in their life, looking for a way out from the pain of a memory with someone they loved.   The idea is sorta strange but once the movie starts, you can see how the love knots get tighter and how Joel had to have a way to forget Clem, for his own relief. (As we have all experienced, if you have lived at all!)  The basis of the movie - to erase those painful memories, is a seemingly excellent way to resolve it.  But, as anyone knows... (but no one can understand) how much comfort you have with the memory of love, painful or not.  Jim Carrey is just incredible as Joel, the quiet, reserved and tortured soul.  He isn't Ace Ventura any more!   And Kate Winslet has a perfect \"yang\" to his \"yin\", playing a bouncy, hair coloring free spirit.  You couldn't find a more opposite coupling, or one more perfect....  Anyone who is trying to forget, anyone trying to 'move on' should go see this film.  It's therapy for the mere price of a matinee ticket and a smuggled in soggy sandwich.  GO SEE IT! You'll be smiling and thinking for days....  :)\n",

      "What is a nugget as it applies to a movie? It is the central idea of the film on which the story is built. I like going to movies but having seen as many as I have its the ones with an interesting nugget that gets me in the door. Often times the movie does not do this idea justice ( like \"Taking Lives\", what a letdown! ) but this one does.  As this movie  flesh's out just what it would be like if you could remove an unpleasant memory from your life it does that wonderfully. If you liked romping through the mind of John Malkovich or traveling through the dreams of a sleeping mind like \"Dreamscape\" this movie will definitely entertain you. The acting by all involved is very good and the main character is so well developed you feel as if you've known him for a long time. The most critical item about any movie for me however is the story built on the nugget and this not only met my expectations, it had an extra treat added: it actually teaches something worthwhile about relationships and love that will make you feel better about your own life.  A simple yet powerful masterpiece.\n",

I feel compelled to talk about my personal experience watching the movie so this won't be about technical stuff or character review. I immediately engaged with the story, and found myself at first struggling to understand what was going on...caught myself shifting into the paralysis of analysis. Thinking things like wait...that didn't make sense...why did he say that? So I made a conscious decision to drop that approach and found myself having a kind of out of body experience watching myself watching the movie and feeling a warm glow.  Hmmm... this is me loving this movie. Not having to analyze every scene not having to contemplate what might happen next. My own viewing experience became dreamlike in the sense of appreciating the complexity without having to know all the answers. There was a moment somewhere in the film when I realized the significance of the opening scenes (hair color! hair color!) and then I relaxed into the memory/dream sequences with a kind of clarity about the cycle of the story. In the end, it all came together beautifully for me and I realized that I had participated in one of the most moving movie experiences of my life. I walked out wanting to talk to someone about  what I had just seen...wanting to hear someone else's perspective. I'm meeting my husband in Las Vegas later today so am hoping it's playing there so we can see it together.

But there was always this underlying feeling that made me like Kaufman films so much more then anything else.  So obviously going in to this movie, i had very high expectations.  I was afraid they were to high and the movie would be a bit of a let down.  But after the movie, i can honestly say I am changed.  It really put everything in perspective for me.  I've had a relationship that ended recentely, and i always said \"that was just a waste of 2 and a half years.\"  That's not fair.  After this movie, I learned that no matter how bad it ended or how hard it is to give up there is a point for everything.  I now realize that we had a lot of fun times and a lot of great memories.  I wouldn't take it back for the world.  Infact, I even mended the friendship that i had thought would be gone forever right after i saw this movie.  I called her and told her that i want to remember the good times, and i won't let you forget them.Like i said, there comes a time in everyones life that they see a movie that can really change them.  I loved Adaptation and Being John Malkovich. But this is different.  This is perfection.  It's hard to express how important this film was to me, and how important it is that everybody sees it.  It was so good, I'm questioning my skill as a screenwriter/director because i just can't do what he and Gondry did.  It is truly a masterpiece. The best film i have seen and the only film that i walked out inspired enough to confront my fears.  In this case it was rekindling a relationship that had gone bad.  Now we are friends again, and my memories will always be good of her.  Thank you so much Kaufman and Gondry and Carrey and Winsley and everybody else in that movie.  It was priceless, and will never be forgotten.  If you're weary of this film, i only have this to say.  Go see it.  You'll be happy you did.10/10... deserves to be in the top 10 on the top 250.  i think it's number 1.\n",

I went into this movie a little skeptycal about Jim Carrey in a more serious role, as his last attempt(The Majestic) was terrible. Eternal Sunshine was not only the best peformance of his career, but one of the best performances by an actor in recent memory. Winslett too gave the performance of her career, and the two combined made this an instant classic. After watching this film, you cant help but drop your jaw. This film completely messes with your head, all the way until the end. If you havent seen it, see it. If you're still not sure if Carrey will be good, he is.

I pity anyone who doesn't find this movie enjoyable, because it's truly is a wonderful film that has a fuzzy old message of love and life presentended in a magnificient and unbelievably rich story that will keep your undivided attention.Also some of the visuals in this movie are a real trip. I don't think i can come up with enough adjectives to give the film justice, just know it's spectacular and i'm almost sure you'll like it, especially if you like movies that have plots that are presented in a unique way ( think \"Momento\"-esc)\n",

      "It would be easy for any reviewer talking about Michael Gondry's new film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, to get caught up in talking about the clever memory-erasure device that Charlie Kaufman dreamed up, but to do so would be a grave mistake. While the Lacuna operation's ability to purge all the memories of a person is a fascinating device, it's merely a coat rack for the heart of the film to drape itself on.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind at its heart is a romantic comedy. It's not a romantic comedy that Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock would star in by any means, but it is not far removed from the likes of Annie Hall, portraying romance and love as the bumpy and unreliable beasts that most people experience them as.Now, although I have used the word comedy, Jim Carrey fans should be warned not to expect the usual rubber-faced laugh-it-up antics that the actor often delivers (or at least tries to deliver). Carrey's Joel is almost universally straight faced and dull. He refers to himself (and is referred to by Clementine) as `nice', as in `nice' meaning boring. Clementine (played by Kate Winslet), on the other hand, is impulsive, spontaneous, wild, and generally quite the energetic woodland sprite. Her hair color frequently shifts throughout the film, more frequently than even her wardrobe which is haunted by the orange sweater-style jacket that she wears when she and Joel first meet.The pair would seem completely incompatible at first glance but seem to share some kind of deeper connection, as if they had shared a love in another lifetime that had somehow outwitted death to come back again. Unfortunately though, even the strongest emotions can't completely avoid spots of turbulence, and the pair's conflicting traits eventually do cause a painful clash and separation as Clementine storms out of Joel's apartment after he accuses her of using sex to get people to like her.Joel is distraught when he realizes his error. We see him crying in his car later the same night. Over the next few days, he tries to make a move toward reconciliation. He buys Clementine a necklace and tries to take it to her at work, but when he gets there he finds out that she no longer even recognizes him. There is no anger, frustration, sadness, or bitterness. There is simply a void where Joel should be.Joel finds out from his friends that Clementine has undergone an operation through which all memories of him have been erased from her mind. Impulsive and unwilling or unable to deal with the pain of the break-up, Clementine simply chose to forget everything that had ever transpired between her and Joel.The meat of the film begins when Joel decides in a fit of helplessness that he will also undergo the operation and have Clementine wiped from his brain. Gondry's slightly surrealistic style takes center stage as we follow a backwards tour of Joel's relationship with Clementine inside his brain.The first memories are painful. They're fights close to the break-up, and Joel is glad to be rid of them, yelling at Clementine with a certain degree of spiteful glee. As their story winds back though, Joel finds himself swimming in the happier times when his love for her was at its most powerful. He quickly realizes that he's made a horrible mistake, and Gondry (and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman) twist our heart-strings into figurative balloon animals as we watch Joel struggling to hold on to even the smallest memory of Clementine, only to watch her vanish again and again. He is constantly thrown back to earlier memories, knowing that like a ticking time bomb he is slowly moving toward their first encounter after which he will have no recollection of her or their love.Intercut with Joel's struggle are the complicated romantic entanglements of the Lacuna staff, including a slightly unethical relationship between uber-creepy Stan (Elijah Wood) and a freshly re-programmed Clementine. Even as she seems to take to Stan, she clearly is confused and upset by the absence of Joel, suggesting that even though Lacuna may have destroyed her memory of the relationship her emotions remained untouched. Clementine is possessed by feelings that her mind can provide no explanation for. She feels compelled to re-live experiences that she's had with Joel, except they don't play right because she re-lives them with Stan instead.\n",
      "While the memory plot is fascinating and proves a great way to tell the story of Joel and Clementine's relationship, the real story of the movie is that the technology is ultimately a bust. After the procedure, both Joel and Clementine are lost at sea, searching for each other without knowing what they're searching for or why they're searching to begin with. It's a testament to the power of love in people, and the foolishness of denying that love no matter how rough and difficult sometimes holding on to that love may be.Despite it's clever tricks, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind has its heart in the human heart, and that's what makes it one of the most powerful movies I've seen in years.\n",

      "if you like vanilla sky or memento, you have to love this movie, simply for the genius directing. Some may find the story not as exciting as those two movies, but you have to see this movie at least twice just to try to figure out the chronology of the story, because the director tricks the viewer. pay close attention and dont assume something is the end or the beginning. You'll either love it or hate it, but go see it\n",

      "(I'll try to comment without giving too much away for those who have not seen the movie)  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an awesome movie. Much of the movie is, by nature, jumbled and sometimes confusing, in the \"stream-of-consciousness\" fashion since a lot of the movie takes place inside Joel's mind.  There is a point where things are confusing because the beginning doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie--until the ending comes full circle and you realize that the ending is the beginning, and the beginning was the ending.  (You will understand when you see it...remember this and it will makes sense!)  Everything falls into place at the end. The movie was thought-provoking and touching, and I would definitely recommend seeing it.\n",
      "1707\n",
      "After two viewings of the film, I still can't pinpoint what exactly it is that makes it so amazing.  I'll try to piece something together here...First of all, there's nothing I hated.  None of the characters feel out of place, are poorly acted, or deliver lines that make me cringe.  There are NO wasted lines of dialogue here.  There are no ridiculous or distracting jokes, but the movie is definitely funny in places.  The story manages to be somewhat twisted (and in parts downright vague) without ever becoming confusing (although the ending isn't spoonfed - the movie leaves room for interpretation).Jim Carrey gives a \"serious\" performance that isn't just some version of his comic roles without the liveliness;  his Joel Barish is dark, subtle, but, at times, very heartfelt (especially in the last 30 minutes or so).  Kate Winslet's performance is very cool: she came across a less-suicidal, more comedic version of Marla Singer (it must be the faux-American accent!) and the entire supporting cast is wonderful.  The acting in this film is, basically, spotless.So, why is it that this film (at the time of writing this) is #130 on the IMDB Top 250?  Well, it's one of those heady, somewhat trippy, but definitely intellectually stimulating films that is impossible to walk away from.  Like 'Memento', 'Sunshine' will stick with you for days after you've watched it.  That's not to say that the films are at all alike, although both explore the idea of memory.  Where 'Memento' ultimately paints a dark picture of humanity, 'Sunshine' decides that love is somehow deeper than neural activity.  This, combined with fantastic cinematography, writing, and acting makes 'Sunshine' a movie that will find a place on many a top ten list - and, I'm calling it right now - it will hold steady in the top 50 of IMDB for some time.\n",
      "1708\n",
      "First of all, I'm a huge Charlie Kaufman fan.  All of his work is interesting, inventive, and always totally original. This is a great idea for a film, with time going backwards in the relationship until the ironically climatic...meeting?  You will laugh, think, and relate to this quirky romantic comedy.  Kate Winslet is flawless as the eccentric young bookstore worker that is the film's catalyst.  A must see; Kaufman's best work as he explores the balance between a painful memory and no memory at all. This is a film that it helps to see twice...you might want to take notes! Also explores a few interesting angles on this premise with an excellent supporting cast.\n",
      "1709\n",
      "I absolutely adored this movie.  It was beautiful... Maybe a little confusing, but awesome.  The plot was great... funny, deep, beautiful.. it made me want to cry, but in a good way... the kind of cry that is out of frustration... I wanted the love displayed in this movie.  I liked how the movie jumped around, because it left you guessing.  It wasn't typical... It was unlike any romance I've seen... Jim Carey surprised me.  He was funny as hell (as usual), but the movie was more about that... it wasn't too wierd... too deep.. it was just a good movie.  I would recommend this to anyone. Um, I'm at a lack of things to say about this.  I don't want to sound repetitive.  The movie displayed different aspects that could appeal to many different types of movie watches.  It had humor, it had depth, it had good visual appeal... Yep, it was a good movie.\n",
      "1710\n",
      "I too can appreciate Kaufman's originality but there has to be more than \"wow,that's really clever\". I thought there were some nearly romantic moments in this film - moments that hinted at some emotional truth - but those evaporated just like the car. The problem here is that everything is so destabilized that what might pass for truth is undermined by the sense that this too will be a trick - and it usually is. Kaufman's films have a million inventive bits that stretch the medium but all this hey-look-at-me stuff pales next to one human moment. Just to make the 10 line minimum - the baby scene was really painful and serves as an example of a writer, director, and actor so caught up and giddy with their own schtick that the film goes off the tracks for 10 minutes.\n",
      "1711\n",
      "Well, what can I say about this movie except praise? The acting is very well done. One of Jim Carrey's best performance! Reviews have said that it is THE performance of his career. Kate Winslet delivers her character very good as well. This film clearly steps away from traditional filmmaking. The conventional tricks of showing flashbacks isn't used, so to the unbeknownst viewer, it might get confusing at some points. I like the way the basic timeline is setup. If you've seen lots of flashback-type movies, you'd know what I'm taking about. From the beginning I already suspected something funny was going to be happening with the shifting of time and memory.\n",
      "However, the movie made me a bit dizzy at some parts, I had to look down from the screen. It was because they pretty much used a handheld cam the entire movie. It seems to be a trend nowadays. I guess the point of using a handycam is to make the film more intimate. Like you're actually there with the characters, as opposed to looking through a window at these people's lives. I like the use of the spotight when they go into their memories. It was quite different. There were a few laugh-out-loud moments though. That's probably what made me like this movie so much. It was a personal drama with intelligent comedy and a hint of sci-fi (with the whole technology of erasing sections of your memory), yet to an extent believable. I like how the supporting roles had a sense of contributing to the coming-together of the movie. Kirsten Dunst's character, which at first I thought was another one of those filler roles, was actually significant. It's one of those movies that comes together in the end, but YOU have to draw your own conclusions as to how it really ends, you know? See it, and you'd get what I'm talking.All in all, great movie. I'd see it again. It's up there in my list of favourite movies. And trust me, I'm judgemental when it comes to movies. Takes a lot to make a movie please me.\n",

      "At the end of the movie i was crying because i thought it was really a beautiful story but next to me in the theater there were two older ladies who were not as happy with it as i was.  They said it sucked and that it was trash and it was confusing.  That just shows you that everyone is different. This is the kind of movie where if you can follow it and understand it then you will love it because it really is a beautiful love story  .... but if you can't follow it then you probably wont like it, obviously.  I thought that jim carrey and kate winslet were both very good as well as everyone else.  I was told that before i went to see it that the acting was horrible but i dont agree. I suggest that no one listen to anyone elses opinion and go see it for yourself.  I thought it was great but dont take my word for it.......\n",

      "It is sad that a movie with a cast like this is so dull and dreary. If I ranked movies from Charlie Kaufmann scripts, this would be better than movie about the orchids but nowhere near as good as Human Nature and Being John Malkovich. Kaufmann seems to reuse the sequence in Being John Malkovich in which the actor goes through his own portal. Whereas those scenes were brief, it comprises most of  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Oddly enough, there isn't much  development of either Jim Carrey or Kate Winslett's character beyond the grief caused by their relationship.  We knew who Lila and Dr. Bronfmann were in Human Nature. Ask yourself what you know about the afflicted souls in this movie. All you will come up with is that they are an unhappy bunch. I am a big fan of all the stars of this movie, save for Mark Ruffalo, I mean, really. They can't save this movie individually or collectively.  Maybe it wasn't in the script.  Maybe it is the director's goof. Make no mistake. This movie stinks.\n",

      "I sat in awe dazzled by the masterful construction of this superb movie. As I watched I finally realized that these two confused people were really all of us. The two sides of each of our \"coins\". How intense were the feelings I had in Joel's memories under the kitchen table waiting for his mother to return? And the sink bath! No wonder I thoroughly enjoyed giving our children kitchen sink baths. I loved the ending on the white beach. The juxtaposition of snow on the sand and the fade to white and the cleansing of both of their minds. This movie was wonderful.\n",

      "Let me start with my fav aspect of the movie, its name. I pondered on that for nearly 5 mins before I gave up and just went to see it. It was the complete surprise that made me enjoy the movie in entirety. Carrey has done some marvelous bits of acting and the characters and their roles were so wierdly and accurately placed that it easily fit into your mind. Ok, Elijah did a nice job for the tiny role he got, and yes for the first few minutes I was thinking abt LOTR of and  pretty excited at seing Baggins all dressed up in a yellow spotted shirt and dark tie sporting a wierd beard. I tried to get a glimpse of his feet but nope, they never focussed on that. Anyway, I'm deviating here, from the point. From the begginning the story had its own momentum and kept picking pace which I like being a staunch disliker of PDL kind of movies. And the camera, screen play and interchange of focus was so smooth that it felt pretty real. Now I am trying hard not to tell anything abt the story so as to let you get the full experience, but the scene to scene change was brilliant. My favourite is when Carrey comes out of the bookstore and enters the living room of his house with lights switching off in the background. So well imagined and best of all, somehting that is getting pretty rare these days, almost no technical/logical flaw. Nothing that makes you realize that this is just a story. Suffice it to say I feel bad abt not catching Adaptation and Being John Malkovich and will do so the very next opportunity I get.\n",

      "So many comments here focus on Jim Carrey's fantastic portrayal of Joel, but please don't forget Clementine, as played by Kate Winslet; she nails the part!!! Too well, in fact.As the movie progressed, I developed my own love/hate relationship with Clementine. Bipolar and only occasionally takes her meds? Seems that way at times.The only sticking point for me is why did Joel choose to erase his memories of Clementine? If I had met this woman and fell in love with her, I would never choose to erase my memories of her, even if the relationship ended terribly. As I said, Kate plays the part too well, but then, we wouldn't have much of a story, would we.BTW, Kirsten Dunst in panties!!! Nuff said. ;-)\n",

      "It's good to know there are still movies made that have the screenplay as the most important element.  The writers of Eternal Sunshine bring us a story that shows real insight into affairs of the heart.  How we move from being passionate lovers to not being able to stand the sight of each other, and why we never seem to learn and do it over and over again; a sort of Groundhog Day of relationships.  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are perfect as the ultimately doomed lovers.  The story unfolds in a creative and entertaining way that makes us see that the old cliche is true: it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.  10 out of 10.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a first rate comedy that will leave you glued to the screen in amazement and confusion. This film does not have the usual characteristics that create a laugh out loud comedy; it is unusual and highly independent. It rises above most comedies and finds that a few laughs are hard to come by, but with a cast and story like this, Sunshine is a perfect comedy that keeps you guessing all the while making you laugh. No one ever said that it was easy to get over the one you love. For Joel Barish he is learning that lesson in the most extreme way. After a chance meeting with an unusual woman named Clementine Kruczynski, Joel finds that this perfect romance soon turns out to be like nothing he had ever imagined. After a strange breakup, Joel and Clementine go on their separate ways, soon Joel finds himself in the shadow of the woman that he loved, he gets an even bigger surprise when she has no idea who he is. She acts as though she never knew him, and he soon finds out that she had him erased from her mind. Now trying to get over her he does the same thing, the only way to get over her is to remove her from his mind. Along the way Joel and Clementine meet some of the strangest people to ever grace their lives. Jim Carrey plays Joel and he is amazing, I believe that he deserves to receive an Oscar nomination. This is a performance that we have never seen him in. Kate Winslet who is one of the best actresses around, turns in another first rate performance. She is very funny and has a soft side that makes for a perfect choice for this character.  Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson, make up a wonderful supporting cast that are all great playing each one of their characters. This really is a great movie; Charlie Kaufman has yet again given us an out of this world movie going experience sure to leave you laughing all the way to the bathroom. There is also a softer side that will make you think about what could happen if you really could erase someone from your mind. This film is so original and so great; there are also some neat twists that drive this film to a place in movie making history. I have to give this film 3.5 stars out of 4 and an A!\n",

      "The Charlie Kaufman movie with perhaps the most mainstream appeal; a movie in the Vanilla Sky-mold with an abundance of plot twists. I really loved this film.  The idea of having memories erased is made to seem both interesting and horrible.  I spent a lot of time wondering which memories I myself would have erased if this technology was available, to only decide later that despite all the sham and drudgery of rememberance, I wouldn't want to live any other way. And isn't that the thing that makes a successful memory- to transport the audience through an experience, to carry them on an emotional journey?  This is a cathartic film, completely saturated with a fantasy that feels inconceivable but becomes quite real. As I left the theater, I overheard a lot of people complaining about this movie.  Maybe an affinity for Charlie Kaufman is a pre-requisite for seeing this movie.  Eternal Sunshine has all the characteristics of Kaufman's past works, though ultimately surpasses those former works in imagination and emotional profundity. A movie worth seeing over and over\n",

      "You leave the theater in almost a peaceful sense of awe. This movie was funny, creative and just makes you feel a longing for these people. When you end a relationship you would love to lose the hurt and the pain and the sad feelings. But in this situation it means losing the good feelings too. As you're watching this man fight to hold onto the love he once had you almost crave the love and it makes you think about your own loves and losses. How it felt to be hurt, how it feels to remember just being held or the smell of your lover as you hold him/her close.As you watch Jim Carrey you almost forget that it's him. He's serious and believable as this quiet man. Kate Winslet is gorgeous and spunky as his mismatched girlfriend. The supporting cast, or the \"professionals\" are funny, quirky and have their own interesting plotlines. If you like movies where the scenes jump around and the camera work is choppy(IE if you like FOCUS features)you will love this movie. I can't wait till I can own it.\n",

      "Rule number one: This is NOT a \"Jim Carey comedy.\"  Jim Carey does a marvelous job, but it is not one of his typical over-the-top roles. This movie is a fascinating and touching look into what actually, specifically makes up the content of thought and memory. When you remember something, what actually goes through your mind? What part of you \"plays back\" the memory, and what part of you observes this memory being played back?  What if you could consciously effect all of this? And- forgive me for asking so many questions- would you want to be able to choose which memories to keep, and which ones to lose?  How would you choose?  In this story, someone makes this choice and then regrets it. What I found so touching was how this movie shows the power of love over all the usual things that we consider to be powerful.  The movie asked me what can I reasonably expect from a committed relationship, and what measure of happiness and contentment will satisfy me.  Of course, these ideas aren't original to \"Eternal,\" but they are handled well. And for those of you who have ever referred to the stuff going on in your head to be your \"tapes,\" their's an incredibly good and very literal part about the \"tapes\" that we play for ourselves. I very highly recommend this movie for anyone who cares (one way or the other) about the nature of the relationships we choose.\n",

They were showing them in bed under the yellow blanket and he said \" this memory I want to keep\" and most other memories were of the same GREATNESS! If he did have bad memories of her during the erasing process wouldn't he have thought to himself (subconsciously of course) that he was doing the right thing by erasing her from his mind?\n",

      "It happens once in a while: a masterpiece. Far beyond Adaptation and Being John Malkovitch in quality and depth.\"Sunshine\" is about the way we build our memories, the way we mix them with our present lives and how we sometimes try to suppress these memories. It is a masterpiece in the sense that, although it appears simple, all the crafting and hard work of the director, the actors and of course the writer are not apparent: they serve the movie humbly, silently and efficiently.I could go on and on about the superb acting, but this is besides the main quality of this movie: \"Sunshine\" resonates with the viewer's own memories and works as an echo of what we have all felt at one point or another of a relationship. It touches you on a personal level because as the memories of Joel are being erased, you are moving back in your own. The very reason why you feel for the actors and their story, although it can be completely different from yours, is that the way you remember things is playing on the big screen.When you walk out of the movie, you cannot help but think of the one you love and the ones you used to love, remember how they led you to make the choices you have made and how they have been a part of you and your mind ever since.\n",

      "I cannot express to you how amazing and excellent this film really is. You just simply have to see it for yourself. Charlie Kaufman digs into the senses so deep, and touches the heart with such passion. This is not so much a fairy tale, but a story of humankind and the relationships we have with other people and ourselves. I left the theater with an overwellming feeling of compassion for the characters. Seeing previews I was not expecting much, because Im not one for fairy tale/fake films, however this is not one of them. The fictional element of memory erasing that is depicted in the film, does not feel unreal or impossible at all. Excellent film...I cannot say this enough. Just go see it!\n",

She grew on me so much I didn't want the movie to end. Jim Carrey finally masters the \"normal\" man role without sacrificing any of his inherent charm and humour. These two alone could have held the story together with no trouble at all. I would go out and see this again but, the theater is closed for the night.

I didn't care whether Joel and Clementine ever got together again or not, I just wanted out of that theatre.  My husband felt exactly the same way.  Sure Jim Carrey plays a much more serious role here.  The problem is, everything is so low key, it's an exercise in sheer boredom.  The movie also seems to go out of its way to make every character slightly off and every situation rather odd.  Give me a straightforward plot without the artsy crap any day.

When the end credits rolled I found myself depressed that there was no more of this amazing film.  Upon watching this movie, I was a Charlie Kaufman virgin.  Now I want to go and buy(not rent) every movie he's ever had anything to do with.  The story was delightfully quirky and the telling of that story was, in my opinion, flawless.  The characters are so brutally convincing(yes, even Elijah Wood's character), that you feel pulled into Joel and Clementine's struggles and memories along with them.**Spoilers** Close to the end of the film when the opening scene is replayed and everything comes together, I found myself mentally thrusting my fist into the air and thinking \"Now this is real filmmaking!\"Oh and another thing: the soundtrack is superb.  The best movie score I've heard in a very long time, if not ever.Do not listen to closed minded neophytes who can't grasp the twsiting and turning journey on which this film will take you.

      "I saw this with my boyfriend, who at one point threw his jacket over his face out of disgust with what he was watching.  He calls this the worst movie he ever saw, but I liked it, eventually.  The plot boils down to (believe it or not): boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy tries to get girl back.  This popular \"romantic\" theme takes on a whole new look here (understatement) with man vs. machine and the agony of the death and resurrection of a relationship.  I enjoyed Jim Carrey's performance so much. Shy and reticent romantic, he was wonderful.  The whole cast was great to watch.  But I have to say that the rapid-fire flashback, flash forward, dream/fantasy/exaggeration/symbolism/realism/sci-fi effects were sometimes exhausting.  Charlie Kaufman, who also wrote Being John Malkovich, a film I liked, really pushes the imagination envelope.  The off-putting shaky-camera cinematic style was initially distracting and irritating, but if there is ever a movie suited to that school of cinematography, this is it.  It was long, too long, but is that because it was too long, or because my boyfriend kept groaning?  Poor Steve, a good sport for sitting through this movie with me, but I owe him.

Abelard is a prominent 12th century philosopher who falls in love with Eloisa and is castrated by her relatives who find out they are in a relationship. After the tragic incident Eloisa retreats to a convent, Abelard to a monastery. The Pope poem is a letter from Eloisa to Abelard written during this time they were apart.  Another reference was made to the same poem in the movie Being John Malkovich also written by the Charlie Kaufman.  As puppeteer Craig Schwartz was staging a scene from Eloisa to Abelard he got badly beaten up by a parent who thought parts of it are \"dirty\".In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Joel (Jim Carrey), decides to get the memories of his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) erased only to find out during the procedure that this is not exactly what he wants, that he is still in love with her. Realizing this, he tries to hold on to them, try to resist the procedure. We watch him struggle to keep the memory of Clementine alive in the same way Eloisa tries to hold on to memories of Abelard.\n",
      "The complexity of the plot requires our attention. However, once we give this attention everything fits in perfectly. It is very coherent and logically consistent. I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers.\n",

      "I enjoy the way Charlie Kaufman. Much like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, Kaufman riddles the mind with what ifs and pushes screenwriting to its limits. He writes films that make you think.*Here might be spoilers, read at your own risk!*Eternal Sunshine is a wonderful film. It brings up the idea that memories cannot be erased even if we try. They are still inside of us, no matter what we do. Many characters try to change themselves by erasing memories of their loves and obsessions, but can those memories actually die? Or will they fall into the same patterns again and be attracted to the same people?The main plot is about the love relationship between Clem and Joel. One night, the impulsive Clem has walked out in a puff from a major fight. She has found out from a mutual friend of theirs a new treatment at a clinic that will erase Joel from her mind. Thinking him boring and repressive, she does the treatment and then doesn't notice it is him when he comes into her workplace with a Valentine's Day make up present. In fact, she even has a new boyfriend.Upset, Joel has the treatment done too...but along the way, we find out the doctor and other people who work at the clinic are using the treatment and the memories of others to weasel themselves in and out of people's lives. The character of Mary, seeks out the treatment because she is obsessed with someone she can't have.  One of the other workers uses Joel's memories of Clem to try to seduce her (which is strange to me since she is erasing Joel out of her memory, but to each their own...) to ill effects. I won't spoil the ending, but I thought the plot line was deep and brought up philosophical questions like:What is memory? Does memory make us what we are and if we lost one, do we lose part of ourselves too? Is it better overall to live with a few bad memories if we also have the nice ones? If we erased someone from memory, would we still be attracted to them? If this memory wiping service was available, would you use it and on whom...and why? Is a person you were intimate with ever truly gone?After the movie, I discussed all of these with the friend I saw it with. Any movie that does that is amazing in my book. The idea of Eternal Sunshine is fresh and fun, it keeps you guessing what will happen and wondering what JUST happened. This is the future of movies and with each movie, Charlie Kaufman improves and gets more socially relevant and witty on the quick draw. If you like intelligent, original films, you must go out and watch this film!\n",

      "I think there will be people who won't be able to handle the lack of sarcasm in the film. Anyone looking for a feature-length sitcom won't find it here. The humor's amazing without leaning on tired sorts of irony or in-jokey pop-culture references. The performances are surprising, the story is riveting and fantastically twisted, and the entire film is incredibly thoughtful. Strangely perfect and accurate. It covers so much ground. Kaufman & Gondry never condescend to their audience-- the whole film builds like a puzzle-- it's like lucid dreaming in a theater full of people.\n",

      "I thought this movie was excellent Both the filmography and acting was spectacular I was amazingly impressed by the screenplay and of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's acting I was already very pleased with Kauffman's writing skills from watching Being John Malkovich (which if you have not seen is very highly recommended) i appreciate this film because it isnt what you expected nor nearly what is seen now a days\n",

      "I don't know if I was just particularly emotional when I saw this but I cried several times and felt weepy for about 30 minutes after as well. There wasn't one thing that I would change about this movie (acting, directing, writing)- it all seemed to work perfectly for me. I think this movie works best for those that are either in or have been in a longterm relationship -- so much of what they go through (besides the wacky brain surgery)is what couples go through. I like the idea that certain people will find each other no matter what.I wasn't sure how I'd like Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey as a couple but it seemed completely natural. I hope Kate Winslet gets to do more films that show her comedic side.\n",
      "1736\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind looks not only at relationships themselves but at how important people in our lives affect everything that revolves around us.Jim Carrey plays a man who's girlfriend (Kate Winslett) has had him erased from her memory by Lacuna, Inc. (headed by Tom Wilikinson). In retribution, Carrey's character pays to have his memory erased of all knowledge of her.The film is played out through out-of-sequence scenes and bizarre imagery. This is a trend of many independent films (the recent 21 Grams is an example). I am not a large fan of bizarre filmmaking (I usually find it too pretentious), but here it is used pretty effectively to show the erasure of the lead character's memories of the ex-girlfriend.The big problem in this Jim Carrey movie: it's really not very funny, and his character isn't incredibly likeable. The journey the character goes through is indeed fascinating, but the character himself is humorless and bland. They should have injected him with a soul, then we could have cared more. There are some great moments with the Lacuna staff (the highly unethical trio of Mark Ruffalo [outstanding in this film], Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood). There are some quirky moments with the free-spirit only adequately played by Kate Winslett. And I do like the ending, both the poetic justice of the plot summation, and the question \"how do you recover a relationship when both parties know what you really think about each other.\" But I'll only give it 7 out of 10.\n",
      "1737\n",
      "Yet another mind-boggling and inventive screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, who specializes in multi-layered stories that whimsically examine human identity, \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\" is about the idea of memory erasure. Following a passionate but disastrous love affair, Joel (Jim Carrey) finds out that his ex, Clementine (Kate Winslet) went to a new organization called Lacuna, Inc. to have her memory of him erased. Angry and hurt, he decides to retaliate and have his memory of HER erased as well. As he did with Spike Jonze, Kaufman is working with a director here who does a great job of expressing his strange ideas visually. This time, it's Michel Gondry, who like Jonze has directed some of the most creative music videos of all time (Gondry's repertoire includes Bjork's dreamlike \"Army Of Me\" and the Chemical Brothers' optical illusion-riddled \"Let Forever Be\").\n",
      "While Joel undergoes the procedure, most of the movie takes place inside his head (which allows for Gondry to give us plenty of bizarre, surrealistic visuals), as he is made to relive his memories with Clementine before they're erased. Going back to the good times, he of course realizes he doesn't want them to be erased, but it's too late. All he can do is savor the memories before they're gone, which is a heartbreaking situation.\n",
      "Meanwhile, in the real world, an interesting little story of its own is developing among the memory technicians working on Joel (played by the interesting group of actors Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood). \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\" (the title is a quote from a poem by Alexander Pope) is not for everyone. It's a strange, confusing and unconventional film, but those with an open mind will love those qualities, and recognize its originality, excellent performances (Carrey has never been better), and unpredictability. The only slight flaw I can think of is that it feels a little too long, but that might just be a result of so many twists and turns that it's hard to mentally process it all. Not for all tastes, but I highly recommend it for people who like their movies to actually surprise and challenge them.\n",

      "This movie is listed as a comedy, but there's little humor in it.  It can't be a love story, as the two lead characters don't have any chemistry.  Is it a science-fiction/fantasy movie?  Kind of, but the plot is thin.  I KNOW !!! It's a JIM CARREY movie !!  That must explain why most people give it a 10 rating.  Granted, he is good in the movie, but I felt I was watching two other (better) movies at the same time:  What Things May Come (Robin Williams) and Total Recall (the Governator).  There were some good technical scenes, but overall the movie was depressing and somewhat dull.  Was the movie done on a shoestring budger?  It seemed they shot it within a three-month period, as most of the scenes were set in winter.\n",

      "You know, I thought I saw the most original, most moving piece of film-making in years when I first saw Lost in Translation last month.  I thought to myself, \"What an original work of art!\"  The acting was superb, the script great, and, most important of all, the music sounded \"right.\" The feeling of the movie stayed with me, making me watch it almost 10 times the first week I bought it on DVD.  I thought it should've won Best Picture, and I continually believed that I would never see a movie as spell-binding and heartfelt as Lost in Translation.Boy was I ever wrong....Charlie Kaufman's latest mind jaunt is something of epic proportions.  I saw this movie last weekend for the first time with my girlfriend and, even before the opening credits rolled, I looked over at her and I said, \"This movie is gonna be amazing.\"  What an understatement.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie ask so many questions answer them ALL.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie grapple with so many issues and handle them as perfect as a professional juggler.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie that made me think about my own life and my own experiences as much as this movie did. I've never felt like \"that\" coming out of a movie before.  And I say \"that\" because, frankly, I don't know exactly what my feeling was.  It was somewhere between surreality and bliss, somewhere between puppy love and pure love, somewhere between genius and brilliant.The plot, if you haven't heard, is this:  a nondescript loner Joel Barish decides one day to skip work (for a reason he does not know) and go out to Montauk Beach on Long Island.  On the way back, a young woman named Clementine decides to strike a conversation with him, and ultimately hit it off.  This seems like the beginning of a budding relationship, but once the opening credits start roling, we know it was not meant to be.  Joel then finds out that Clementine has had him erased from her memory.  With feelings of strong spite, Joel decides to do it himself, ridding his mind of the memories of there relationship.  The majority of the movie resides in Joel's head as we watch memory by memory be erased.  However, midway into the procedure, Joel feels regret and wants to keep these precious memories. The rest of the movie finds Joel trying to save Clementine by shoving her into memories where she doesn't really belong, such as childhood memories.  In between shots of Joel's mind, we see the pair of nerds who do the procedure in Joel's apartment, the guys who work at Lacuna Inc., the company that does the procedure.  ( Bear in mind this is a very short summary )Jim Carrey once again dons a serious role, but this time he connects.  He plays Joel perfectly, from the outside quietness to inside vulnerability and insecurity.  Kate Winslet once again belts out another award-worthy performance as Clementine.  She is so out-going and eroticized that you have to fall in love with her.  Never once throughout the whole movie do you think that these two don't belong together.  Their onscreen chemistry is perfect.  They seem to keep moments on intimacy even during the times when they don't get much onscreen time.  The supporting cast including Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood (can you say creepy?), Kirsten Dunst, and Tom Wilkinson give stellar performances in what seem to be minor roles that turn into extremely important ones.This movie is one of those films that blur the line between comedy and drama, but it seems to be true to both genres.  Charlie Kaufman is a genius, pure and simple.  Go out and watch this movie.  It'll make you think about life in a brand new way, and that my friends is the mark of greatness.\n",

      "I saw this movie a little late, because I could not find time, but it was spectacular and i wish i had seen it earlier.....Jim Carey did better than even in man on the moon.  I felt him throughout the whole movie.  My personality is completely unlike the one he played, but I left the theatre, feeling like him......It does jump around, but if you give it 3/4 your attention you will follow undoubtedly.  There was too a point to it...simplified the point is even a relationship with arguments are not worth erasing, and can be worked out....but the symbolism and hidden meanings exist exponentially.  I strongly suggest seeing this movie with anyone, it could be a girlfriend, friend, parent or child.\n",

      "A great movie!! Jim Carrey was fantastic!!It was funny, endearing, made me cry, a thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking film.  If you've ever wished that you could erase the one that ended badly, this is the movie to see-- remember the good times...Kate Winslet was convincing as the eccentric and confused Clem, and Elijah Wood certainly put Frodo in the closet!  An all around stellar cast, and a great screenplay...I'd definately go see it again.  The visual clues to the story make it a film that functions well without dialogue, and the voiceovers are superb!!  Can I say enough times how great this film was?  Not that erasing memories is a bad idea, but Eternal Sunshine made me glad that I have the good and the bad...\n",

      "...and do a damn fine job of it, if I do say so myself.It goes like this: Carrey has a girlfriend, but Wood ALSO likes said girlfriend.  Wood points out Carrey's faults to girlfriend.  Girlfriend erases Carrey from mind. Carrey finds out, has girlfriend erased from HIS mind.  Meanwhile, Wood reproduces Carrey's actions for girlfriend, who can then remember having done this before.  Back at mind erasure HQ, Carrey rediscovers love for girlfriend, played by Diaz. So now Carrey and Diaz love eachother again, but...now they have NO idea who eachother is.  Insanity ensues.I have been very impressed by recent films; add 1 to the list. 5/5\n",

      "Ah, Valentine's Day! For lovers, it's wonderful. But if you're not in a relationship, or your relationship has gone sour, February 14 is the saddest day of the year.That's the first lesson of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", and it is a truism, a bromide, a trite and hackneyed notion. Love hurts ... What a concept?That's just one of the reasons I found this film, um, forgettable. Oh, technically, it's mildly interesting for its disjointed storytelling and the neat way objects fade or quickly disappear from view. And Kate Winslet is certainly quirky as Clementine, erstwhile girlfriend to Joel (Jim Carrey). But the rest of the cast are largely wasted, and this is not the breakthrough dramatic role for Carrey that it was hyped to be.It isn't until the final reel that we clue in to what might be the moral of the film: Even if our memories were erased, we would still gravitate to the same person all over again. In other words, some people are meant to be together.The film quotes Friedrich Nietzsche (not once, but twice): \"Blessed are the forgetful: for they get the better even of their blunders.\" Does this mean that we learn from our mistakes? Apparently not. Both Joel and Clementine, and Howard and Mary, make the same mistakes all over again. At least Clementine is honest about being \"just a f***ed-up person looking for her peace of mind\".But if the message of \"Eternal Sunshine\" is that we are doomed to go on f***ing up, even when the slate is wiped clean and we are given a second chance, then -- with the film as with life -- why bother?\"Eternal Sunshine\" is full of truisms, it seems. Yet it misses the truest and saddest reality of all. You don't need the services of Lacuna Inc. to make your memories go away. Time does that for free.\n",

      "This film is not for those who want to go for a mindless escape.  It also is not a typical Jim Carrey film.  It certainly has humor but there is little in the way of sight gags or over the top actions.  This film looks into the whole concept of the human memory.  Moreover it explores relationships and why a couple becomes involved with each other.  It has a style that shows creative direction and cinematography.  The acting is great.  Jim Carey should be nominated for his performance. Kate Winslet is at times a hoot in this film and at other times you will feel sorry for her.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Charlie Kaufman should also be nominated for his screenplay.  If you want a serious film for adults that will make you think and laugh a little too then you will probably like this film.  It is a nice film!\n",

      "was the first word i thought of when the movie ended. i had to just sit there and soak it in while the credits rolled. between this and big fish, there havent been so many optimistic yet not corny movies made as long as ive been into movies. the direction was good, not overbearing as people have claimed. the scenes from joel's childhood where everything appears from the perspective of a child were especially effective. carrey and winslett were both fantastic in their parts, you felt equally frustrated with their actions yet you yearned for that raw love they obviously had for each other. beck's version of the \"i need your loving like the sunshine\" track was also a highlight, it definitely added to the overall atmosphere of the movie.\n",

      "This is hands down the best movie to come out so far this year.  It was unpredictable, funny and thought-provoking.  This movie will definately be up for best screenplay, failing 5 unbeivable scripts come out this year. Jim Carrey's performance is FANTASTIC!  The movie is more serious than anything he's tackled before, but he still manages to create humor in a few scenes as only he could.  Elijah Wood was believable, Kirsten Dunst plays a far sexier role than she's known for, and Kate Winslet was good as well.  I don't want to give away any plot, but it is definately something original and suprising.  I heard many people walk out of the movie and say \"I don't usually walk out of a theater this statisfied.\"  It's true! This is one of the years top movies, don't miss it.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  You will not regret it!\n",

      "This film coulda been a contenduh......but not as produced.The premise wasn't bad. What happens when a relationship fails, and you want to erase all the memories of it from your mind? Can you? Can you cope with what happens when you try? Shy, sweet, backward Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and crazy, impulsive, freedom-loving Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) have this problem. Their relationship falls apart and Clementine has Joel erased at a company called \"Lacuna\" (Latin for 'pit', medical term for 'gap or missing part'.) Joel, at first baffled by her behavior, finds out and has /her/ erased. But he can't erase the longing, the yearning and the regret--it is still there, though now it has nothing to attach itself to. This, according to the filmmakers, can make a person depressed. Not that the principles of this movie aren't /already/ depressed. They certainly seem to be having a difficult time coping with normal life(Winslet's character actually seems to be psychotic in some scenes, and Carrey retreats from life at a breakneck pace at times;) but imagine, if you will, that this depression deepens and lingers and makes it difficult to function in even normal situations.Basically, those are the bones of the film. Bad relationship. Erase the memories. Cope with results. Stir in a sub-plot about (hold on to your hats here,) a bad relationship...erasing those memories...trying to cope with those results...and yet another subplot about (no, I'm NOT kidding) a BAD RELATIONSHIP, which is most certainly headed for erasure...yes, it's THAT repetitious.  Filmmaker Michael Gondry has absolutely nothing new to tell us. Relationships--he seems to want us to know because he keeps hitting us over the head with this huge hammer --sometimes fail. Well, duh.Carrey is competent, as is Winslet, but they have minimal chemistry together. Also, there is very little reason to think even for a moment, that the relationship that Joel Barish finds with Clementine is affecting enough for either one of them that they would have this much trouble forgetting each other, let alone need to have their memories erased completely. Given that very basic, but totally unsupported premise, the rest of the movie just falls apart, logically and emotionally. And when you add to this the incredibly annoying hand-held camera technique that the filmmakers thought was necessary to show the difference between 'real' (?) and 'memory' lives, you have a film that makes you flinch, fidget and blink about 15 minutes into it and doesn't let up until 35 seconds before the ending. If you stick it out, it might even make you physically nauseated from all the visual disturbances it creates!  It's not only like watching the sinking ship of a bad relationship, (hell--it's more like watching the sinking of the entire Spanish ARMADA,) but you also get the seasickness to go along with it.That I could definitely have done without. It ruined the whole experience.Other performers are just wasted. Kirsten Dunst as Mary, the nurse at Lacuna who is hopelessly involved with Doctor Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson;) Patrick (Elijah Wood,) who is in love with Clementine as well; and Mark Ruffalo a technician who is in love with Dunst's character, all have such thin parts that no development is possible, and the film resorts to whacking you over the head with their stories  too. You get whacked a lot in this movie.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind might have had potential, but it is ruined by gimmick and an immature vision of reality that just doesn't gel into a reason, or set of reasons, for the action involved, and by camera techinique that ought to be banned for any but the smallest screens. Nearly everyone in attendance at this film was looking somewhere other than at the screen, or asleep. Or they walked out for relief from the visual gymnastics.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine\" displays vivid scenes from a wonderful/terrible relationship. The first hour was a total waste -- slow, sentimental, shallow-- and I considered walking out several times. The movie has long stretches where nothing much happens but picks up when it becomes a chase, with the hero and heroine attempting to elude the memory erasers and preserve/ create the best moments of their relationship. At no point did I care much about the characters or the pretentious plot, so action and bright flashes were appreciated. The end of the movie focuses on the question of whether they (we) would begin a new relationship knowing that it would end badly, exposing our vulnerabilities and character weaknesses, but that it would include some peak moments and enlargement  of ourselves as well.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman does it again...this guy is well on his way towards a whole separate chapter of his own in screenwriting history...highly unconventional time after time...maybe it's an acquired taste, and maybe he goes off the rails now and then, but this is definitively NOT the sort of linear storytelling you're used to...gotta applaud the sheer originality he brings to the table...Kate Winslet's hair is the target of enough theatrical paint to cover a good sized Manhattan office building with 2 coats...beyond that, she puts in a helluva nuanced performance...Jim Carrey tones it way down except for one truly wacky scene in which he regresses to childhood...(that scene alone is worth the price of admission)...the supporting cast, in particular Mark Ruffalo, provide some unusual comic moments throughout the film...some acting nominations may be in the offing come awards time, but the screenplay is the real star of this film and director Michael Gondry does a nice job of assembling the pieces of this sci-fi tinged puzzle of a love story...\n",

It's filmed mostly handheld, not steadycam, and the constant jiggling of the camera nearly made me barf.  I had to leave the movie about halfway through and find out from my family what happened in the second half.\n",
      "Needless to say, that was rather disappointing.  I had the same problem with Saving Private Ryan.

The two of them spend some wonderful moments together but all good things must eventually come to an end. After a big fight, Joel finds out that now Clementine has no idea who he is because she has had all her memories erased of him. Joel decides that he wants to get his memories erased of her also but during the procedure, he realizes what a wonderful and magnificent love he had with Clementine and that he would like to keep those moments forever not only in his mind, but in his heart as well.This movie was like sucking on a jawbreaker, sweet, hard and once you get used to the flavor, you never want to let go. Everything about it was just perfect, it's charming, sad, funny and most importantly, real and very special. The cast was wonderful, the beautiful Kate Winslet especially blew me away. Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst were also great and very entertaining in their roles. This movie is truly great and those of us who love a little strangeness in our lives, will adore it.

I will have to hand it to Jim Carey and Kate Winslet for good job of acting, but I could not make head nor tail of this movie.  After an hour I had to walk out, and yet the critics are praising this movie to the sky.  Maybe it is because I am older and I like a movie that is entertaining and is not a message sender. I glad I saw it at a preview and did not pay for it, and as far as I am concerned I would suggest skipping this one, but if you got to see it, RENT IT.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman. Not many people know who he is. Is he an actor? Is he a director? Is he a producer? Well... no, none of the above. He's a writer. And a damn fine one at that. Since his arrival in tinsle town, Charlie Kaufman has brought us two of the most kick ass movies of this Millenium; Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. His writing has become synonymous with the word obtuse. Each of his past two movies have delved into the world of the warped and yet been able to keep reality a part of the story. In his latest movie, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, he breaks all the rules and takes us all into a new dimension of the word warped. Jim Carey stars as Joel Barish, a man who has very little self-esteem and questions his own reason for existance. Joel finds out that his ex-girlfriend, who has hurt him worse than anyone ever has, had all her memories of him erased from her mind. Joel makes the decision to do the same. Only he realizes that his memories of her are the only positive things he has left. He takes it upon himself to do everything possible to keep Clementine in his thoughts and beats the process that is wiping her from his memory. If this plot sounds confusing don't worry, it is. This movie is one of the most original films I've seen in a long while. Scratch that, since Adaptation. The romantic element and the character depth work so well together in this film. All the outside factors play a significant role in the outcome of the film and leave you wanting to see more after the credits role. There are some great supporting roles, especially by Elija Wood, who picks a great post-Frodo role as a pathetic technician whose choices throughout the film make you feel sorry for him and hate him all at the same time. Kirsten Dunst and Brad Renfo have great chemistry in this film as well and their scenes together work out terrific. Eternal Sunshine is a great date movie for those who love the oblique. If you're looking for a simple When Harry Met Sally like movie, this ain't it. This is something a thousand steps up and only a true fan of film can appreciate the amount of work and effort that went into this. You're not going to want to erase this movie from your memory any time soon.\n",

There isnt a single thing missing from this production. When all is said and done Im going to have a tough time finding a more enjoyable film than this in the coming season.A good film must be based on a solid screenplay, and since this is Kaufman's best one to date, we are already off to a great start. Everything about this offering from him is focused, engaging and interesting. Perhaps its because he is now a seasoned veteran, or maybe its because the themes here are more personal and sentimental than his last few scripts, but whatever it is, he just totally dominates the craft of creating a screenplay here. True to form, he avoids all of the cheap, cliche sentimentality of Hollywood films and forces the audience member to interact with the subject matter and engage their mind in order to get anything out of the film - something that turns out to be a far more rewarding payoff than the standard silver platter method of emotional delivery that is plaguing most movies lately. I respect this dimension of his work and acknowledge that somehow he takes his skills to the next level with this one.Throw in Gondry's excellent and inventive direction to the mix and the film is heading higher. His chamera techniques and use of light, movement and space is impeccable and he captures the essence of the emotions in a beautiful, unique way. I tip my hat to his directing, realizing that the subject matter called for something over the top and skilled. Thanks to Gondry's fine work, the words and ideas are given life through his phenomenal directing.All you need is some top notch performances, and boy does this movie deliver here. Jim Carrey seems (oddly enough) made for this role, and his dramatic performance here exceeds any of his comdeic roles comparatively. He seems comfortable with his character, and his understated approach here gives his charecter form and shape. I knew Carrey could act decently if given the right material, but this really was a revelation I think. This performance should be his career defining role. With Kate Winslet its basically the same story - powerhouse acting on a higher level than we are used to lately. Too bad the academy will bypass these performances come oscar time for the conventional, cookie cutter teary routine from denzel washington or whoever else. These performances are the kind that deserve serious recognition.\n",

      "The movie was great, but its message seemed kind of fatalistic (if you are a pessimist) or I guess like fate (if you are a mystical type).  It seems that the characters are doomed or fated to make the same mistakes and love the same people; the problem with erasing memories is that the characters cannot learn from their mistakes and it becomes a vicious cycle.  What's romantic and touching about the movie is that Joel (Jim Carrey) realizes that he doesn't care if they are doomed to fall into their familiar rut; he's willing to take the chance with Clementine (Kate Winslet).  The relationship between the two is fun and eccentric, but, as a woman, it's hard to believe that Clementine would fall for Joel.  Kate Winslet is stunning in this movie, especially with the colored hair! and Jim Carey is unattractive to say the least, his voice colorless, his chin stubbly, and he easily looks 15 years older than her.  The other characters are surreal and creepy, gotta go!\n",

      "This movie is so amazing!  I loved absolutely every minute of this and am actually going to see it again, something I NEVER do!!  From the opening scene I was totally into the movie.  It is so beautifully shot and acted and Jim Carey brings something to the screen that we haven't seen from him before.  He is nuanced and honest and subtle.  I thought that Lost in Translation was fantastic but this blew that out of the water.  I find myself, days later, replaying scenes in my head and feeling so moved from the overall meaning of the film, which is that love is complicated and hopeful and always worthwhile just for being the experience that it is and moving us and shaping us like it does.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone but I will concede a few things.  It is a little obscure, not complicated per se but, like Memento, you may not fully understand everything happening while you are watching it which makes it an even more interesting picture.  But, if you are not into movies that you have to think about, as Britney Spears was quoted as saying at last year's Sundance, don't go. Go see Starsky and Hutch instead.\n",

      "Despite the naysayers, the filmgoers bound to conventional aesthetics of the 20th century, this film combines the writing ability of Kafka with the philosophies of Pope, Nietzsche, Schoepenhauer, and God knows who else.  It is, however, an art movie, and as such, you will have your lot of folks who simply don't get it.It is a visceral, powerful, mind-trip that I believe Orson Welles and Kubrick would have commended, a trip so true-to life and emotional that by the end you cannot help but see yourself in the roles of the characters, no matter how strange (or banal) they are. This jumped to my favorite films of all time immediately, quite a feat considering my rigid expectations for movies.  I haven't felt so awe-struck and intellectually challenged walking out of a theater since 2001: A Space Odyssey.This movie is true cinema- an ingenious, prolific American screenwriter paired up with a visionary, talented French filmmaker.  Overall, if you are looking for cheap entertainment, look elsewhere.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a movie for people who want to think, and if you think, it delivers a powerful, and potentially life-changing punch.\n",

      "This movie is not for everyone.  This is not your everyday bennifer romantic comedy which has sorority girls packing the aisles.   This is a movie which requires open-mindedness and concentration and true appreciation for the flawed beauty of love.I read that some people thought the editing was shotty.  I say the editing was almost irrelevant.  This movie was a story and characters, and nothing else mattered.  The special effects used were sometimes hilarious or sometimes subtle and classy and other times dramatic and profound, but they merely enhanced the film.The acting was superb.  You feel like you've known these people your whole life, and you feel as desperate to give them happiness as they seem in searching for it.There is great pain, great sadness, but all is healed by an infinite hope for renewal.  This movie is a gift to the spirit.\n",

      "I saw this movie twice, and I have to say that it was excellent. Unlike a few other titles that have used the 'time-hopping' idea, Eternal Sunshine was clear, but not obvious. The flick's plot was amazingly intricate yet understandable. I think that too many people went into the theater thinking that Jim Carrey was going to put forth a Bruce Almighty type of performance and left disappointed. Obviously this movie is not of Carrey's normal roles, however he delivered a solid performance. I was also quite suprised with Kate Winslet's performance. After her last blockbuster, Titanic, I was happy to see that Kate Winslet can really act. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys movies that they have to pay attention to, or anybody's who's been getting sick of the brainless garbage that has been released in theaters as of late. Eternal sunshine almost had a Requiem/Memento/Donnie Darko feel to it, without being exceedingly pretentious, drawn out, or boring.\n",

      "Bravo. Thank you for assembling an amazingly talented group to present this amazing story. That sounds so technical. Who cares! I was (goshdarnit) affected by this movie!!!! I didn't cry. But crying is so easy to get from people anyway. I would think you'd feel cheapened if I said that. No rather than crying, I was inspired to get over the little crap that goes on between me and my girlfriend. Love, live, work it out!!! Beck summed it up so nicely. You all did it!!! Be proud. I'm inspired. I'm inspired to write. To tell stories that may be able to get where you did with this film. The acting the writing the directing the camera work, every technical aspect, etc...It succeeds. Thank you.\n",
      "1763\n",
      "There are few films being made these days that really put into effect the codependence that lies between what we see and what we feel.  While the theme of 'Eternal Sunshine' certainly resonated with me in my own existence, certainly with each other person's own as well in the theater, it captured much more than a nostalgically winter rediscovery of past and present loves. It takes you through a donen-esque landscape littered with episodes from here and there, then and now, but it doesn't tease you with a notion that some thematic sequences are dreams.  Everything is real.  Everything really happens.  There are no cop-outs where we have to find Joel through his dreams to reveal what he thinks.  I liked it because it didn't subject us to a dream, but allowed us to dream, ourselves-- and it is better to dream together than to dream alone.\n",
      "1764\n",
      "I haven't read any of the other reviews here before writing this.  I saw this movie just last night, March 20th.  Wow.  I've seen Being John Malkovich and Adaptation (numerous times).  I already knew that the writer, Charlie Kaufman, is a nutty guy.  Man o' man, he really takes you on a trip this time.  This movie is for ANYONE who's loved and lost, and wishes they could forget, and move on...or go back and pick-up where the relationship ended...as if either can happen.  In real life, it's not easy, or impossible.  In this movie, those issues are addressed, sometimes with dead seriousness, in other ways whimsically.  The story floats in and out of serious situations and knuckle-headed silliness.  I liked that a lot because moments in our life can be both of these things, and memories and dreams of these moments are mostly what we're left with when the moments themselves have irreversibly come and gone.  I myself have felt so many of the emotions and even had so many of the experiences of this movie's lead character: splashing (yes, splashing) in the snow with the most beautiful person you've ever met...feeling like you can die now because everything you wanted to happen has now come true...daring to fall madly for someone, thinking they felt the same way, only to realize they didn't care, or couldn't care...they're living their own version of the nightmare.  That sensation that you once knew someone, and now you can't find them, as though perhaps you just imagined the whole thing.  C'est la Vie!\n",

      "I didn't know what to expect when I entered the cinema last Friday. But the movie certainly surprised me in a very positive way. I loved Jim Carrey in Man on the Moon, so I was very pleased to see him in a somewhat serious role again. Some \"experts\" find his performance \"hollow\", but I would say that this was exactly the intention of his role. Carrey plays a broken, confused man, and he does it well, very well. It is remarkable that you can actually forget that you are looking at the comedian Carrey, sometimes you even forget that he IS Carrey, and you only see his character. Together with the other cast members, especially Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst, Carrey makes this an excellent movie. A movie that requires the audience to think, and that is not a disadvantage between the brainkilling movies out there.The only negative point I found was that it dragged a little bit towards the end. Otherwise I would have given this movie a 10/10. Now it has to settle for a still excellent 9/10 for me.\n",
      "1766\n",
      "Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's performances can only be described as supreme!!! I would remcomend everyone to see this movie that has ever dreamed of or is in love. It's an awesome love story with a few comice reliefs thrown in.  Jim Carrey on his best performance yet. Truly inspiring and leaving you wondering \"What if?\" With interesting twists and amazing editing I would be suprised if this movie didn't at least get nominated. Don't walk in to it expecting the typical Jim Carrey even though he does a great thing with this character many people leave disapointed and in shock. Also don't expect this to be a movie that you can just sit back and enjoy because you are constantly thinking and trying to up with the story of the bad side of love the side that many of us know but never talk about. ENJOY!\n",

      "I just watched this twice in the past two days and sweet goodness.  This is without a doubt one of the deepest films I have ever seen, a contender for my number one film of all time. I have to admit, I thought Being John Malkovich was clever but horribly shallow and I thought Adaptation was enjoyable but highly pretentious.  But now that Charlie Kaufman has ditched Spike Jonze for a good concept, the result is movie magic.  I also thought that Jim Carrey couldn't pull something serious off (and I'm not a huge Kate Winslet fan either), but the cast was perfect and completely effective. This movie examines what I find to be one of the most important life philosophies, the concept of memory and the self.  It shows, as I would argue and agree with, that though we may wish that we had never met someone who now causes us pain, it is the good moments you had that are important and that erasing those moments may take away the pain, but it will also take an important piece of you as well. I wish I could feel satisfied with this review (I generally don't with any) but I had to write it anyways to describe the feelings I am having towards the greatness of this film.  It isn't without its flaws, but who can blame the director for problems when dealing with a concept this monumental?\n",

      "I really have to write something about this movie... Original and different from most of today's films, this one manages to capture your attention from the first to the last minute! This is not your typical Jim Carrey movie, so don't go just for Jim...as you might be disappointed. Jim and the rest of the actors are very good, but the screenplay is pure magic: original, touching, inventive, and sometimes even groundbreaking! The director, or anything else did not impress me; this is a pure screenplay-acting film, nothing more...but don't expect some art movie, or cult movie...is still a Hollywood movie. Definitely one of the best movie of this year!\n",

      "I saw this film the day it came out, last Friday, and nearly a week later I am attempting to put onto the page how deeply I feel about it.\n",
      "I can start by saying that I have the most profound respect for Charlie Kaufman - I think he and Mike White are the most brilliantly subversive (and subversively brilliant) screenwriters working today - and in Eternal Sunshine, with his team of superb actors and a kindred spirit director, Kaufman once again does what only he can do: probe, stretch,  and literally recreate the depths of his chosen reality, turning it inside out, around and back again, without ever losing sight of his story's priorities at any given time.  He's a masterful writer with a daring mind that knows no boundaries or limitations, and in this film he directs his unflinching genius at relationships -- the human need for them, the over-whelming fragility of them, and most profoundly, the pain they cause when we expect another person to fulfill the parts of ourselves that cannot be filled by another person - the illusions we have about each other, the baggage we bring to any new encounter, the neurotic preconceptions that pretty much doom any relationship once it gets past the newness phase.   Kaufman shows this to us brilliantly (and subversively) in the course of Eternal Sunshine, but this is just part of the \"magic\" he pulls off here: he also actually manages to get inside the mind of his main character (played with unerring poignancy by Jim Carrey) and show us his subconscious process - this is not easily accomplished without resorting to cliches galore, but Kaufman and his crew manage to pull it off without a hitch.\n",
      "1770\n",
      "ESOTSM is a fabulous movie! Our theatre rarely gets indie flicks so I was tremendously excited when I found out they would be showing this! It did not disappoint! This movie tells the story of Joel erasing Clementine from his mind with much symbolism, and a nice subplot involving Mary, Patrick, and the doctor. Kate Winslet is absolutely brilliant and so raw here, Carrey is equally amazing and completely transformed from his usual self, and even icky Kirsten Dunst does a nice job here. Very original and different! It is so nice to see something not the norm every now and then!!! This movie will grab you and keep you thinking until the very end. 10/10! A must see, and a great way to be introduced to indie flicks! Now, is that ten lines yet?\n",
      "1771\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is very simply a brilliant film. From the gorgeous cinematography to the odd special effects and the uniformly excellent performances, it is a winner. It may be too edgy for some, as it treats relationships in a realistic and gritty way, but if you like your movies a bit off center, and you want to be thinking of them several days later, this one's for you! Jim Carrey gives a beautifully understated performance as the sad and insecure Joel. (Hopefully he, like Bill Murray and Robin Williams, will finally be recognized for the wonderful actor he is.) Kate Winslet's characterization of the strange and wonderful Clementine is spot on and Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are delightfully creepy. Kirsten Dunst is skilled at portraying damaged characters that seem OK on the surface. I saw the story as a metaphor for death. Even when everything is gone, there is still something left... Let's hope Charlie Kaufman has more stories like this up his sleeve.\n",

      "Upon seeing the billing for this movie headed by Jim Carey and Kate Winslet, I had my reservations. After such performances as \"The Majestic\", and \"Titanic\" (respectively), I was anticipating that Kaufman and Gondry would be carrying the weight. However, I was in for a treat, as both Carey and Winslet gave what may well turn out to be Oscar worthy performances. Also giving noteworthy performances are Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, David Cross, and Tom Wilkinson.As for the movie itself, Kaufman delivers once again, with a stunningly beautiful movie that forces careful examination on what we think of love and life. One of Kaufman's triumphs in this film is the effect it has on your emotions. Very few writers can achieve a film that has the ability to swing your emotions from one extreme to the other, often leaving you bewildered in the process. Kaufman's subtle touch makes this neither a tear-jerker nor a comedy, yet something that falls in the middle. There are many times in the movie where an overall feeling of misery and regret seems to leap out from the screen, while the very next moment the happiness and contentment of the characters surrounds you.Not to be left out in the cold, Michel Gondry brings his brilliant cinematography to the film. His direction of countless music videos and other works has earned him a cult following, yet after this film I would not be surprised to see him walk away with a major award. His transitions between scenes, and the direction of the camera within the scene is fluid and deft. Had his particular style been attempted by anyone else, the effect would have been jarring and dizzying. His camera work is most appreciated during scenes involving the inner workings of Carey's thoughts.\n",
      "Not much can be said about the relationship between Carey and Winslet's characters without giving away the plot. Suffice it to say that their relationship highlights the possibilities and actions of many people's relationships, and both are offered an opportunity that many would readily grasp, but one that comes attached with obvious yet unforeseen consequences.In all honesty I can say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and easily the best I've seen in the last eight months. It delivers on all accounts, in acting, directing, and writing.\n",

      "beautiful movie. so many nicely captured moments of memories.  as well as the capturing of the hallucinatory mental state.  maybe this has happened to all of us before.  maybe we've all already erased ourselves a thousand times over and our lives are like weary, recorded-over vhs tapes that god recorded oprah on.  the mind feeds on new experiences.  this one feels nice.  also, reminds me of bits of seconds by john frankenheimer, and vanilla sky/abre los ojos, and also dark city, but i like this better than all of those (seconds is too scary for me).  please don't erase kate winslet from my brain.\n",

      "I loved Human Nature and Charlie Kaufmann has yet to lead me astray. That being said, I think he and Michel Gondry have come up with a film that resonates on an emotional level unseen in the cinema for a long time. Eternal~ comes across almost like a stage play, with interior monologues taken from the main character's journal, and a manic energy that seems not constructed but found on screen. Kate Winslet is pitch perfect as the soon-to-be- forgotten love interest, who's so imperfect and real you can almost smell her. The reason this film is so brilliant is because it risks everything. Jim Carrey is not instantly likeable. He and Kate have the kind of chemistry high school on-again-off-again sweethearts do. They seem like they're just killing time with eachother. How can the audience connect? Dunno but we do. And it pays off. Hats off to Kristen and Elijah who also play fundamentally damaged people. They almost mirror each other. The film stings. And it threatens to turn you off more than a few times, but if you stick with it, by the end you'll be reeling. You'll not find anything else as interesting or emotionally satisfying at the multiplex this year.\n",

      "I was hesitant to see this movie in spite of rave reviews because I thought Being John Malkovich was overrated.  But this movie turned out to be great. Few movies they make these days are as sweet and romantic without falling prey to any tacky.  You fall in love with the two main characters--this is an outstanding performance by Kate Winslet.  Gondry's cinematography is inventive and perfect--it creates a beautiful vision without falling prey to the \"too many gadgets\" or \"too many cute bits\" pratfalls that are frequent with this type of concept movies.  It was nice to see Elijah Wood as something other than Frodo and Kirsten Dunst steals scenes in this movie as easily as she has in everything else she has been in.  My recommendation is to see this movie without knowing any of the plot information given in the reviews.  But even if you already read them, you will enjoy, and be surprised by, this movie.  This is a great story of a real love affair.\n",

      "I have never seen anything quite like this film before. I wanted to see this film based on the fact that I am a huge Charlie Kaufman fan. Needless to say I was not disappointed.Joel(Carrey) seems to be an extension of the real Charlie Kaufman, since he is very self conscious much like the Adaptation role where Nic Cage played Kaufman. Jim Carrey puts in his best performance since the Truman Show. He really shows unbelievable range in this role and deserves at least an Oscar nomination. I never was much of a Kate Winslet fan due to my lack of exposure to her,(I vowed never to see Titanic)but I must say she was excellent and proved to be one of Hollywood's more underrated actresses. I wondered if there was life after Lord of the rings for Elijah Wood and this role was perfect him.The film itself has to be one of the most well written pieces what it feels like be in a relationship. Eternal Sunshine makes you feel happy, sad, and confused. Unlike the typical love stories that come out every week, this film has depth and for once you get a good understanding of how two people fall in love in the first place.\n",

      "`Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', directed by Michel Gondry (Human Nature) and written by Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation), is at once an existential journey of the mind and at the same time the most heartfelt, honest, and poignant love story in years. This film is brilliant and beautiful with exquisite performances from its cast and a style and beauty that is unique. The film tells the story of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), who has had his heart recently broken by Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and his struggle to get over his heartbreak. When Joel sees Clementine and discovers she has had her memories of him erased, he decides that for his own peace of mind, he wants to have his memories of her erased as well. Things get really complicated and confused when during the process of erasing his memories, he realizes he wants to hold onto some of those moments and feels regret that he did not do things differently. Director Michel Gondry (who is probably best known as a director of videos for Chemical Brothers, Massive Attack and Bjork) does an excellent job presenting the film with a somewhat B-movie style of film quality. Even the science fictional part of the film is downplayed as incidental rather than the focus (as it is presented as a medicinal procedure). At the same time, though, the film has an urban, suave beauty to it, as though the characters, sets, and costumes, all represent this simple yet stylish story that's true focus is the inner workings of the main character's thoughts and the love story those thoughts are focused on. His directorial style is reminiscent of Cameron Crowe in `Vanilla Sky' who uses music albums as his inspiration, but it is much grittier like a French New Wave film (which since director Michel Gondry hails from France, makes sense.) The majority of `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' takes place within the mind of Joel, and within his many memories of Clementine, this offers the viewer insight into both the good and the bad of the relationship. Joel is desperate to erase the bad as he begins, but as he starts going back through the good moments, is just as desperate to hold onto them as one by one they slip further and further out of his grasp. The film has a strange surreal narrative as Joel builds new moments that never took place within his memories with Clementine in an effort to change or alter the process. It shows how a relationship can be both wonderful and fulfilling at certain moments, and horrible and stagnant at others. It is the most honest and real love story in years. Jim Carrey (The Truman Show) gives what is likely the best performance of his career (although some people might debate that `Man in the Moon' was better). His heartfelt and simple portrayal of Joel Barish is the backbone of this film and shows a depth and honesty that Carrey's viewers had never really seen from him before. Kate Winslet (Titanic), as Clementine, brings a lively, fun character to life and gives a perfect performance as always. The supporting cast, which includes Kirsten Dunst (The Virgin Suicides), Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom), Mark Ruffalo (The Last Castle), and Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), all bring a fun atmosphere and kookiness to the film that is appropriate for an Andy Kaufman story. Overall the film is excellent and not much more can be said about it than that.\n",

      "Just took a wonderful walk in the blustery sunshine of this craziness called New England weather...snow one day, glorious sunshine the next.  I thought that the stubbornly blue sky and warm sun was particularly appropriate after watching \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\"  Now this movie is officially my favorite Charlie Kaufman movie...yes, even more than \"Adaptation\" or \"Being John Malkovich.\"  And I already know that I want to see this movie again.  The main reason why \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is so much better than the rest is that it actually ends on both a note of optimism and the irresistible feeling of possibility.  The movie does delve into all the idiosyncrasies and foibles and weaknesses that all Charlie Kaufman movies explore...and the way in which the story unfolds just totally clicked with me.  I can see how not everyone is going to like this movie, and I think that those people who don't probably didn't suspend their disbelief willingly enough.  Once you accept an alternate universe in which memory deletion is possible, this movie is a roller coaster ride into Joel's (Jim Carrey) mind and memories.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I ended up loving this movie.  If you're game, you'll end up feeling the same way.\n",

      "A lot of people will see this film expecting a gushy date film or chick flick.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is nothing of the sort.Jim Carrey provides his most vulnerable performance, serious performance to date.  Kate Winslet is the Gen Xer who is both desirable and yet difficult at the same time.  Both actors portray characters who are against their usual types.Winslet's character (Clementine)decides to erase her memories of the Carrey character (Joel).  Upon learning this, Joel opts for the same procedure. However, while his memory is being erased, he changes his mind as he relishes the good memories he had with her.  We see flashbacks that morph between one another, in settings that become surreal and dream-like.  At times, it's humorous and poignant but not overly sentimental.This film falls a bit short, though, of providing a knockout impact. Still, it's unique and daring.  Written by Charlie Kaufaman, screenplay writer for \"Being John Malkovich\" and the brilliant \"Adaptation.  Go see this with an open mind and patience, otherwise take your date to something more pedestrian.by Triniman\n",

      "I don't like Jim Carrey, or rather I detest slapstick comedy. It was only his performance in \"The Truman Show\" plus the presence of Tom Wilkinson and Kate Winslet that suggested I should see \"Eternal Sunshine\". I'm so glad I did.The premise is good; the acting is believable; the writing is superb. If you liked \"Memento\" you will certainly enjoy this -- with the added bonus of Kirsten Dunst in a sex romp.Other films I've seen recently that I liked were \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" and \"Lost in Translation\" if that helps.See it. See it again.\n",
      "1781\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine is sorta like a part romantic comedy/part drama, but there are some depressing undertones within this offbeat picture. It was wonderfully odd and very reminiscent of another movie, Memento. At times, I felt lost in it, but unlike Memento, I eventually caught up. It was not your average story, of course, what-with the whole memory-erasing thing. I missed the first couple of minutes, but from the opening credits (there was a great Beck song playing!) and on, I really enjoyed this movie. Jim Carrey is fantastic and hilarious as the tragic character, \"Joel\"; Kate Winslet is equally satisfying playing the \"crazy girl\" role. The two actors make a lovely odd couple. This movie also contains substantial roles from Kirsten Dunst, as a secretary; Mark Ruffalo, as a medical technician; and Elijah Wood, as a desperate loverboy.\n",
      "1782\n",
      "The point of this movie is not a complex plot. If you want that, go to the Sci-Fi channel. This story is about the people, not about the technology. You might even consider this to be a \"boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl again\" story. It has been done a million times, and yet this is different, and very well done.This story is about the love, and the loss of love, and the pain from that loss. And it is about the even greater pain of having that taken away from you, losing a part of who you are, not just losing the memory of a person.\n",
      "And unlike so many other movies, the minor characters have a real depth - a history, and emotional entanglement in all of this. The doctor is a real person, and the technicians, the family, the receptionist, and they all have major character flaws that give them real depth. It feels real.  I've met these people before - they are not cardboard characters, none of them. Most of them are actually kind of creepy, actually, but it is subtle.This movie does not use the standard set of tricks to evoke emotion. It simply tells the story, and in a way that is suspenseful even though you know what is going to happen from the beginning of the movie. It can be a tear-jerker at times, yet it never feels forced.I am in awe. This is science fiction of the highest calibre. The science does not get in the way of the story, yet is an integral part. It is also a love story of the highest caliber, not a chick-flick, not a guy-movie. Something for both. Very, very well done.This is a great date movie.\n",

      "I just got back from seeing this film, and I was very impressed with every aspect of the work. Charlie Kaufman's story and screenplay was what I expected it to be and then some. As absurd as one of his films can become, I still felt that I could relate to the story in some way. Michel Goundry and crew also do an excellent job bringing such a unique script to life. The visuals are truly a sight to see, as the dream world is efectivly connected to the real world. I would also like to remark on the superb sound editing. Finally, a terrific cast eased my concerns about this film being a sub-par attempt. Jim Carrey can act, of he wants to. But you'll have to see for yourself.\n",

      "When I say \"Eternal Sunshine...\" is \"Total Recall meets Lost in Translation\"...I'm referring to \"Translation\" in a figurative rather than a literal sense. I don't mean to imply this movie deals with a foreign language and culture, though it's dizzying flashback pace may appear incomprehensible at times (not to mention, the world of human interaction/relationships,as we all know, could use a translator now and then). Carrey seems at home in this dramatic tour de force in a way that Schwarzenegger never could. It has that classic \"independent movie\" flavor...with character development and a compelling (if not confusing) story line. Let's just say, its no \"Emperors' New Clothes\" homage to the Coppola name...there is true substance in this reflective genre.\n",

      "There is none of the usual Jim Carey slapstick or goofy noises and faces, but instead a surprisingly thoughtful, complex and thought provoking story. There have been several movies at least that I can recall which deal with the subject of erasing and/or replacing memories which are unpleasant or painful (I think Ben Affleck had one earlier this year, that no one seems to remember- hey it really works!).  They usually involve spotless labs and sinister technicians in white coats.  In this well spun take, the memory erasers (by design) behave more like the dolts who come over to connect your cable television from Verizon. There is some interesting play with flashbacks and Carey's character's attempts to defeat the memory erasure for which he had contracted to remove thoughts of a failed relationship (with Kate Winslet) while it is in progress. As the viewer sorts out the chronology of the film as it unfolds, and the effects of the various inter-related subplots with the small cast of characters you are drawn closer into the story, and the impending outcome. The movie is set in the present, and the troubled relationship is depicted as very real, and actually very troubled, but that in itself is quite realistic.  This is not a \"Hollywood\" love story, (although in a larger sense, perhaps it is, in a more modern and updated version). It will make you think, and maybe make you smile.  Who knows?; You may have even seen it already...\n",

      "Having just seen the film not 20 minutes ago, I must admit that it has not had time to settle into my mind. My first reaction, though, is \"beautiful.\"The film manages to portray inner consciousness in a believably surrealistic and yet utterly gorgeous way. Not to seem like too much of the over-educated prig that I am, the film seems almost cubist in it's approach to reality.The performances of all the actors are wonderful. The production design is inspired. That's enough accolades for now. I think I need to see it again, but I know I want to see it again.\n",

      "This movie was incredible, first of all.  Charlie Kaufman makes me not want to write, not want to birth any concepts of my own for i fear that everything i claim to be mine will always pale in comparison to what he creates.  Eternal Sunshine is a roller coaster ride through the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) that has you laughing, slapping the person next to you and going, \"Ohhhhh\", and then feeling sorry for this person who's trying to hold on to his last memories of his love Clemantine (Kate Winslet). Incredible cinematography, amazing locations, and wonderful acting by such names as Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and David Cross really make this movie something special.  I think that Focus has my full attention after 21 Grams, Lost in Translation, and now Eternal Sunshine.  This movie blew my mind, go see it.  Give it a 10.\n",

      "I just viewed, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". It is something more to be experianced and then talked about with friends, than reviewed. One regret is that there is less 'science' in it, less about the concepts of brain erasure(I mean) and more about Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, but I found this to be a compensation. Whatever chemistry there was (at the end) of that terrible movie \"Lost in Translation\" this film works over. There is definite nostalgia, and unlike Translation, this actually works.. it is actually real, and not forced on by unknown places and anxiousness.Those who know Gondry's work will be pleased, there are many traits throughout that identify his style. With Kaufman, the same \"Adaptation\" presence is felt, especially in the beginning V.O.Not a brilliant piece, but highly intelligent for its genre. Everyone else, Wilkinson, Dunst, Ruffalo, Wood do very well, the acting actually does work.There are no special filters of dazzling special effects in this film, and for that, I am glad. Filters have been overused in recent times....no Lord of the Rings blue and green filters, thank goodness, no cliche special effects.....This film could have come out in the early to mid 90's, and that is a good thing. This film can be compared with Adaptation, and in many points, is much better. Definitely an improvement on Kaufman's \"Confessions of a dangerous mind\", for sure.There is not much else to say about this film, except that it feels like it was filmed in Seattle....am I wrong?  Jim Carrey's performance is like a mix of \"The Truman Show\" and \"Man on the Moon\"(in the more sad parts) AND something else, something better, and new, which I really liked. Jim Carrey overcame his newfound \"Bruce Almighty\" slump! Hooray!Kate Winslet does awesome, even better than her \"Titanic\" and \"Quills\" performances.  Sorry internet nerds, no nudity here... is this Winslet's 1st film without baring all? Which is good.That is all.\n",

      "When I saw the trailer for this movie I couldn't wait for it to come out in the theater, I think mostly because of that ELO song which unfortunately wasn't even in the movie, but anyhoo : ).I agree with another comment that I'd rather not go over the plot as I think you really just need to see it yourself. I really enjoyed it. If you saw the trailer than you know this is about a guy who cannot get on with his life because the memories of his exgirlfriend are just too painful. After he finds out that she had her memories of him erased he decides to do the same, partly out of spite it seems. This movie gives you so much to think about, how the mind works, love, pain, memories, good and bad. It makes you ponder the human condition and question whether it is better to have loved and lost.....Jim Carrey was excellent, Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo were hilarious. I highly recommend this movie. I can't stop thinking about it! That's when I know I like\n",

      "This movie is amazing.  I know I say that about all the movies I like, but when you go into a theatre and can be absolutely transformed, and your emotions are taken on such a rollercoaster ride...that's when you know you've seen magic.  That's when you realize you've been involved in an incredible movie experience.  The story is complicated and messy, and is all about relationships and all about losing someone you love when they don't go anywhere.  And it's jarring and it's emotional and it all takes place on Long Island! and when you watch Jim Carrey, you're amazed by how good an actor he really is and Kate Winslet is charming and schizophrenic and everyone is so well cast and everyone is so mesmerizing.\n",
      "I want to watch this movie again and again.  The cuts were frenetic, and there are time jumps and audio distortion and things don't sync up and it's all on purpose and it's so smart!  Me and my friends Mikey and Jay seemed to be the only 3 people in the whole packed theatre who LAUGHED during the movie because we understood it.  And other people hated it.  Look, you just need to see it and experience it.  Find yourself getting lost in the story and it captures you and makes you think, and Charlie Kaufman is so good at what he does.  And you relate to Joel and Clementine even if you don't want to because even if you've never been in love, their story makes sense, and all the things that happen in a relationship that f*** it up make sense. And to have nearly the entire movie take place in Joel's dreams and have everyone be tainted by his perspective is so brilliant.  Oh my god.\n",
      "1791\n",
      "Is it really better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all? The movie attempts to answer the question of whether there really is such a thing as fate, and if we are fated to be with someone, we will eventually end up with them, no matter what.The movie showcases Jim Carey as the perpetual loser (Joel), the man who can't keep the girl, and eventually ends up subscribing to a clinic which can erase his memories of his ex-girlfriend (Clementine) (The ever so gorgeous Kate Winslet). However, in the midst of the process he begins to regret his decision, and tries to hold on to the memories as they are being deleted.I found the ending the most poignant part of the movie. While not giving the twist away, I found the ending rather depressing; the finality of the situation and the idea that you can't run away from fate. Yet, some may view it as the glass is half-full..and that fate will bring two people together, no matter what.A highly thought-provoking movie, with excellent performances by jim carey and kate winslet. I give this movie 7.5/10\n",

      "What a wonderful film.  The screenwriter of \"Eternal Sunshine\", Charlie Kaufman, lacks no imagination.  I went into this movie with high expectations, having seen \"Adaptation\" and \"Being John Malkovich\", both by Kaufman, and came out with the biggest smile on my face.  I absolutely loved this film.  Jim Carrey, playing boring loner Joel Barish, gives an excellent performance.  He once again proves that he isn't just a comic genius, but a great dramatic actor.  Kate Winslet, playing the spontaneous Clementine Kruczynski, is at the top of her form.  Director Michel Gondry has outdone himself, adding a creativity fitting to Kaufman's screenplay.  I will not get into the plot, because the less you know, the better.  The only thing you need to know is that this film is definitely worth seeing, and is guaranteed to entertain and baffle you.  4 out of 4 stars.\n",
      "1793\n",
      "Watching this film from a writer's perspective was humbling. To bring what this movie deals with to the screen in the way it does is a trick I will marvel at for some time! Edgy at times, comical, beautiful, sexy. Loved Kate Kinslet's performance - the best I have seen from her in some time. And, to my surprise, I forgot I was watching Jim Carey after about five minutes. I tip my hat to Michel Gondry for knowing how to acheive that! I loved Adaptation and Being John Malkovich, but was disappointed by Human Nature so I was a little hesitant going in. However my fears were laid to rest quickly. Because of the intentionally disorienting character of this film, and the rawness of the issues it dives into, I expect 'Eternal Sunshine' will unfortunately not be appreciated by all. But then again, I don't think it was made to be...\n",

      "This movie was simply genius. Charlie Kaufman's best work thus far. The whole movie has you either smiling wide, laughing, or just frowning in utter sadness for the characters.Jim Carrey is out of his shell completely, and it does him good. Kate Winslet finally takes on a character that seems to really make her come alive, and even the supporting roles were so vital to every scene of the movie. Words can't describe this movie, you sit through it wondering just what is going on, and the movie takes you from the giddy moments of true love, to the heart-wrenching emotions of a breakup. But it continuously asks the question, \"What if we really were meant to be?\"Though some might find this movie over-the-top in its way of bringing about the movie, you can't expect anything less from Kaufman. Michel Gondry really shows his artistic ability in every scene. This almost felt like an experimental movie by the cinematography, but will definitely be something you've never experienced before.I highly recommend this movie and only ask that you keep an open mind through it and allow the movie to explain itself when things happen that you can't quite comprehend or seemingly clash with earlier moments. Even the Lacuna corporation couldn't erase this from my mind. If I could see inside a poet's head, this is something I think I would see. Beautiful, brilliant, and nothing short of amazing.\n",

      "ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is well done.  Its plot, characters, and pacing never seem to fall off the wagon.  In addition, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) share genuine chemistry, a testament to their acting and a good script by Charles Kaufman.  Most importantly, the end is perfect--a justified conclusion that truly resonated.   Nonetheless, for all of Michel Gondry's glitz, glam, and special effects, I couldn't quite relate to the picture.  Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist but SUNSHINE appeared to favor artistic endeavors over the actual process of character study.  As a result, many scenes (which filled the surrounding audience with laughter) didn't exactly tickle my fancy.  The side plot was sort of bogus too and I felt Patrick (Elijah Wood)was miscast, making me wish I could send him back to Mordor.  However, I have a feeling this is going to be a very popular movie, much bigger than ADAPTATION, and that Charles Kaufman is going enjoy a long, illustrious career.\n",
      "1796\n",
      "I went into this movie hoping that it would live up to the good reviews that I had heard and read just prior to seeing it, and I must say that it lived up to those expectations and that Jim Carrey far surpassed them.  I think that Carrey has finally broken completely free of his \"Ace Ventura\" type-casted role in my mind.  Even his dramatic work in \"Bruce Almighty\" had some residual feelings of that goofy kind of character (albeit it was called for in the role and overall I liked the movie).  But now he simply shines out with a beautiful piece of work that I left the theater still in awe of. I rarely exit a movie being truly struck, without further contemplation, by an actor's work, but this was definitely one of those rare moments. The movie was also surprisingly easy to follow after perhaps the first 15-20 minutes and the love story was truly beautiful. Overall I was extremely pleased with the results.\n",

      "Trite comments aside, the movie is amazing. Its concept had me intrigued from the trailer, and wondering if such a film could be made. Some of you will not follow the movie; find it boring or confusing. The title is way to long (I actually screwed it up when buying my ticket). But that's OK, its a great film. This is the film in summary. (NOT A SUMMARY OF THE FILM)*Writing/Script/Story: The best part of the film. It is a writer's movie and makes full use of Charlie Kaufman's writing ability. You will, at the end, feel as though you knew the characters as people, not actors. It will become very confusing if you don't pay attention.*Acting: Jim Carrey is an introvert, and you believe it. Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood aren't developed enough for you to get past 'MJ' and 'Frodo'. And Kate Winslet does a double personality flawless. [You'll know the part]*Cinematography: Choppy, almost amateur-like. The shots are framed amazingly well, but border on the film student side of creative. Wonderful use of focus to capture 'fading memories'. And the special effects/surrealism within the memories are true to the fickle nature of remembering. (Really well done too)*Editing: Confusing at first, but at the end everything will make sense. I personally would have extended the opening scene just a little farther to make it easier to follow for the common moviegoer. But still, for the complexity of the concept it couldn't have been better.*Overall: Great movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to think about what they're watching. Probably not a good date movie, if you just want to make out in the back.\n",

      "I absolutely loved this movie.  It was hilarious one moment, quietly contemplative the next and then completely crazy and surreal.  One of the real talents of the acting/writing/directing was that the two leads were able to have very intimate and real moments, like a real couple in love would have, while things are exploding and disintegrating around them, or while in a very surreal scene. Beautiful and Unique. Hilarious and Charming. Surreal and Creepy. these descriptions don't always go together, but they do here. Michel and Charlie, you guys blew me away! ditto to the whole dang cast!\n",

      "Kaufman seems to find in himself an inexhaustible mine of material to write himself as the romantic lead in what is now at least the third film based on himself.\n",
      "In this one Kaufman puts himself in the premise, \"ok, what if I was in a relationship that ended so badly the girl went somewhere and had all memory of me completely eradicated, what would I do?\" What follows is a completely original and astonishing amount of imagination and creativity, but most importantly a deep warm heart about the frustration, mystery and endurance of romantic love.It's an interesting film to watch and to Kaufman's credit, there are no small parts in the film, everything is tightly knit.  This is the most restrained acting Jim Carrey has ever pulled off, and I mean that in a good way, while everything you ever thought about Kate Winslet from her role in \"Titanic\" will be happily obliterated after her fantastic performance in this one. Go see it!\n",

      "oh, wow.  I won't try to summarize the movie here, I'll leave that to the professionals, I'll just give a few thoughts.The performances were outstanding, particularly Jim Carrey, who normally carries his movies away kicking and screaming, but instead in this one he's haggard and transformed, so that you almost completely forget you're watching Jim Carrey. Kate Winslet is also marvelous playing a character who's always about a millimeter away from becoming annoying but somehow stays vital and human instead.  Their relationship is moving and real, and the writing of their dialogue is some of the best I've seen.I was extraordinarily moved by this film, in hard-to-describe ways.  I found myself getting choked up at odd times, pulled under by the gorgeous undertow of the 'dream' sequences.  Don't get hung up on preconceived notions, but also don't worry too much about what it all means, just sit back and let it speak to you...\n",

      "Just saw \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" which I absolutely fell in love with, to a degree that I may not have done since \"Moulin Rouge\" came out. If the brilliant script by Charlie Kauffman, and directing by Michel Gondry weren't enough, a quartet of actors whose careers I have followed for a long time--Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood--all give their best performances to date. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's chemistry, in particular, was electric. I don't want to spoil one moment of this glorious, weird, and wonderful film for anyone, but I do want to say that the last love story I have seen on film was \"Lost in Translation\", a film I really didn't care that much for, but everyone told me have a love story between completely three dimensional characters that fit perfectly together from their first scene together. Although the two films are very, very different, this is exactly how I would describe my feelings for Carrey and Winslet's characters. These people were flawed, frustrating, but wonderful, and wonderfully real people. Kauffman has an amazing knack for using outlandish, fantastical plots as backdrops for fascinating, completely realistic character studies. There are points in this film where you'll want to stop and rewind, or at least pause to work out what is going on in your head. The fact that, in the theatre, you can't, you are forced to sit back and watch and mull over all of the myriad details later, only adds to the film and its overall feeling of madness and loss. And just like his other films, it doesn't ever tell you how to feel nor give easy answers to the complex situations. Very impressed with the directing, too, and how for the most part, Gondry keeps it straightforward and low-key, using special effects or weird camera tricks very rarely, so that they are even more effective when they do happen. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, well if I could I would hand each of them an Oscar right now. If he in particular isn't finally taken seriously as an actor for his brilliant work in this film, it would be a damn shame.\n",

      "I went into this movie unsure what to expect. Of course, I've been waiting for this film to come out for quite a long time. So any vision of the film really was hard for me to come up with.The first five minutes rolled and I feel in love with Kate Winslet's character. And everything else just fell into place.The movie gets down well what it's like to be in a relationship, and how relationships fall apart. When they invent this type of surgery in real life i'm sure they'll be plenty of people wanting to get it, and I'm sure it'll cause some great chaos. If stem cell research which actually can save lives and improve the world is getting flack from insane right-winged people, then this type of thing would as well, but it's a great concept and very possible.The film itself takes on a life of it's own. I'd like to see it again just to absorb it into my skin. I love this film as much as I thought I would. Anyone can love this film. As long as you have a span of attention...see this film. It's well made and well written and true to the heart. If you have no sense of good cinema and just want Britney Spears and MTV to combine again... stay home and cry for yourself.\n",

      "I certainly don't want to spoil this movie for folks who haven't seen it. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  On my way to the cinema I heard the NPR review of it and the reviewer described it as potentially the most clever movie since Memento.  While, I don't think this movie is a Memento rip-off, there are certain similarities.Jim Carrey (and the rest of the cast, truly) turns in his most adroit performance that I've seen.  He is charming and witty (which is normal) and also haunted and cloistered.  Kate Winslet also does an excellent job.If you've liked other Kaufman movies, you'll love this one as well.\n",
      "1804\n",
      "Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry have created a seamless film. Kaufman's writing, which is not as cerebral or self-consciously clever as in \"Being John Malkovich\" or \"Adaptation,\" brilliantly explores relationships and memory, and Michel Gondry's direction is flawless in its execution of Kaufman's ideas. While the film is not as heady or strange as Kaufman's previous two ventures, it is infinitely more heartfelt and genuine.This is, of course, helped greatly by the excellent performances of all the actors and actresses involved. Jim Carrey proves his worth as a serious actor, and Kate Winslet's HUGE performance as Clementine carries a lot of the film. While we never learn many personal details about either main character, by the end you have come to know them and care about them, which is an achievement for a writer like Kaufman who tends to make his characters alienatingly odd.Still, the real star here is Michel Gondry. He's proved with his short films and music videos (Available on an excellent DVD from Palm films) that memory and the psyche are some of the realms with which he is the most comfortable, and his portrayal of Joel's journey through his subconscious is absolutely mesmerizing. He manages to pull off this remarkable feat without overuse of flashy effects, and mostly through simply camera trickery, and manages to downplay the main technological gimmick, which could have come off as cheezy science- fiction.Kudos to Gondry and Kaufman for a brilliant achievement of a film!\n",
      "1805\n",
      "This was quite a good film, but don't sit too close to the screen.  It's filmed to look like handheld...so there is some shaky camera and out of focus.  Kind of makes you dizzy. Some interesting ideas brought up...do we really know if we know everything about ourselves..etc. Entertaining, thoughtful, and easy to follow if you pay attention and don't talk or leave to use the bathroom.  If you don't like having to think when you see movies, don't go see this one. I have just found out I need to write at least ten lines of this. Huh.  Well, I also really liked the camera work, and the colours.  And, when they're inside Joel's (the protagonist) mind, there's some cool special effects.  Quite effective, with the mind erasing thing...it's very neat.\n",
      "1806\n",
      "My wife and I left the theater both feeling really down after seeing this film.  That's not to say that we disliked the movie....we both loved it. It's a story of love and relationships and the complexities that surround them.  Kaufman's unique writing style coupled with Gondry's directing turn a common concept into a completely original and thought-provoking film. \n",
      "In the previous two Kaufman films - \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\" - it's clear that he does not feel limited by conventional storytelling. It's that limitless, that feeling of not knowing what's next, that makes his films so extraordinary.  In a sense, it's what going to the movies is all about - seeing and feeling things that are fueled by the imagination and the idea of \"what if?...\"  What makes \"Eternal Sunshine...\" so great is that the originality is there, but there is also a genuine sincerity to the story. Carrey and Winslet's chemistry is perfect (i was worried about that before seeing the film) and Gondry's directing turns this into a backwards romantic adventure.It's easily one of the year's best.\n",
      "1807\n",
      "I saw the movie in Orlando in the opening evening. This was a positive surprise for a little movie such as it looked like. Although equipped with shiny, today's movie stars, the sets were very simple and modest. I think the most interesting thing about this movie, from the viewers point of view, is to realise the \"point of conciousness\" after having seen the movie. You start to suspect that there's something going on, although it's not indicated as clearly as in Matrix, for example. Finally after getting enough clues, the viewer gets back on track and can understand the meaning of the ending. At least after the second viewing, I'm sure! Regardless of the maybe a bit too long and heavy dream sequences, I'd say Eternal Sunshine was a very enjoyable movie and recommendable to everyone.\n",
      "1808\n",
      "I would say this to all who have not yet seen this picture.  STOP READING the discussions and reviews because this is one of the most interesting times at the movies you will ever have, and it can only be better by knowing next to nothing about the actual plot.Listen when they say that it's \"amazing\" and \"beautiful\" and \"genious\" but turn away from their descriptions and discussions of the actual film until you've seen it for yourself.  I assure you that it is worth it.  Charlie Kaufman is the most original man in Hollywood and Jim Carrey has got to open up everyone's eyes this time.Happy movie-going!\n",
      "1809\n",
      "I thought Being John Malkovich was amusing, but I never want to see it again; and I hated Adaptation with an Elaine-vs-The English Patient fervor! But this Kaufman outing is completely different--no stale swipes at Hollywood genres, no kvetching about the problems writers face when they have to \"compromise\", just a fascinating plunge into the related problems of memory and character-as-destiny... It's very much in the \"Punch-Drunk-In-Translation\" vein, with the added benefit that here the social environment doesn't even have to be \"surrealized\", because we know from the start that most of these events are taking place inside a person's brain... The film does a wonderful job of conveying a real sense of the \"heteroglossia\" that maturing writers strive for--memories of loved ones become reified chunks of otherness within the mind, paving the way for an infinite array of possible recombinations, the best of which have the substantiality of actual relationships! That's creativity folks!Despite the tagline, this really isn't another kick at the innocence vs. experience can... My favourite scene features Carrey & Winslet (who are both excellent) wandering through an empty, darkened building on the beach, testing each other... You get a brilliant dramatization here of the only real power that we possess: the ability to look at ourselves... Who's doing the looking? Who's under the microscope? Who knows? But you know you can do it, and that's all that matters, right? The ability to accept. It's the only possible basis for human equality, and it's good enough for me... Rationalization is self-inflicted brain-damage... I'm telling you, this movie is (quietly) thrilling... Especially if you know and love Dieterle's Portrait of Jennie!Dave\n",

      "I've watched a lot of poor films in the cinema.  How refreshing it is then to A) Persuade whoever is going with you that 50 First Dates is not worth your hard earned fiver AND B) To watch a film that is actually worth the celluloid it's grafted on.And Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was that film.  In fact, in reality, it deserved to be grafted on gold.Doubtless this is an exaggeration, but I really fell head over heels in love with Charlie Kaufman after seeing his glorious Adaptation.  And like Adaptation., this film is superbly well written - the characters are genuine, exchanges are fraught, hilarious and often weird; and the reworking of time is exquisite.  However, as a result of this clever jiggery pokery with the time scale, as well as the occasional saunter through the mind of Joel (played by Jim Carey), it really is quite difficult to keep on top of the action.But this is by no means a criticism.  Far from it.  This film is original (the premise itself is quite honestly very difficult to explain) and stimulating - watching the story unfold really is a joy.But this is Jim Carey right?  Right.  And I've never been his biggest fan. He's funny yes, but I was concerned that he may have been miscast in this film.  Needless to say, I am eating my words now, for this is Jim Carey as you've never seen him before; hilariously funny at times, yes, but for the most part - painfully reserved.  His relationship with the outwardly vivacious Clem, played by Kate Winslet, appears a mismatch from the start, yet herein lies the beauty of this film.  In this most unlikely of couples comes an awkward yet no less profound love.  Carey is brilliant and as the film progresses; you really care for him and his relationship.  Your head literally screams out when his chronic awkwardness comes to the fore. You're moved when he is moved.  And you're deeply grateful to Kaufman that he allows what can almost be described as a 'happy ending', despite the overriding cynicism throughout.Similar surely only in genre to 50 First Dates, this is effectively a romantic comedy, yet intriguingly, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has an element of science fiction within it.  Before long, it appears that Carey and Winslet's relationship has ended, as the narrative takes what the audience can only assume is a leap forward.  Not only has this relationship ended, but Winslet has also taken the step of erasing her memory entirely of Carey, using a new scientific method, pioneered by Doctor Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson).  As a result, Carey also decides to erase his memory of Winslet, but as the process begins, Carey begins to have second thoughts, yet appears powerless to stop the process whilst trapped in his mind.  And it is in his mind that he is forced to relive his relationship backwards as each memory is erased.  It is in these set pieces that the film really excels.  Each as cleverly produced as the next as Carey's world starts to fall apart around him, often quite literally.  Director Michel Gondry uses an array of flashy techniques to tell the story, yet never allows style to overcome substance.Back in the real world, equally intriguing sub plots of greed and manipulation run parallel to the main plot, involving Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst, employees of Wilkinson.  All narrative threads are nevertheless interwoven, and as the film comes to its conclusion, you really are left satisfied.And if you feel like I've just told you the entire plot then you would be mistaken.  This film really is saturated from start to finish.  Not only that, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind even betters Adaptation. Funny and profoundly touching in equal measure, this film beats lacklustre, uninspiring films like 50 First Dates into the ground, giving the 'romantic comedy' genre a real shot in the arm.  And, incidentally, Carey turns out what can only be his best performance.Stuck for something to watch in the wake of Troy?  Watch this.  It's nothing short of a masterpiece.\n",

      "No matter what anyone else has to say about this film , words can not describe the immense pleasure of watching it. Every moment I will remember for the rest of life , not because of the impeccable acting or amazing cinematography ,but the feeling each individual scene gives me. I walked out of that theatre last night with smeared eyed makeup ... second guessing my life's meaning. If a movie can do that to me , a person who enjoys death , destruction and abortions , that it must have been good.  I cant seem to keep on enforcing how really incredible this film was. I felt like I walked away with something I did'nt walk in with. Congrats Charlie , you did it again.\n",

      "I saw this movie on opening night and absolutely loved it. Mostly it is a quiet cerebral ride through Joel's mind where the love of his life is being erased and he's trying to hold onto her at the same time. I thought Jim Carrey was very believable and endearing as quiet, socially awkward, and looking for someone to find him and open him up. Clementine does just that and Kate Winslet was great in that role. Somehow I identified with both of them throughout the film and they are polar opposites. The supporting cast was an entertaining sidenote to the film. I should say that I walked into this looking for a Charlie Kaufman film. The theater was packed with Jim Carrey fans who may have been disappointed with this odd little movie. The older couple next to me left after loudly exclaiming that this was not their type of movie. But I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an unconventional love story with some brains.\n",
      "1813\n",
      "Beautiful Movie! Period. The whimsical chemistry between Clementine and Joel is effortless. Both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey have performed one of their best performances as yet... Anyone who has been in this kind of a roller-coaster relationship will understand the simultaneous impulsivity and subtlety of this film... Hit very close to heart... Hope it hits yours too.Asad Shaykh\n",
      "1814\n",
      "I absolutely loved this movie.  It has hit me so hard, and made me think about what I thought love was all about.  Why do we make it so hard just to love someone else?  Jim Carrey is abfab in this flick, as is Kate Winslet. Even the background players, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Raffalo and Elijah Wood do a great job.  It makes your heart hurt for a quarter of what it is possible to have.  The filming is somewhat confusing in the beginning, but the viewer quickly catches up to speed with what is going on.  All handheld camera work, the wobbly picture is what love is really like.  It's like being unsure and tepid, as we are in life.  The ending is nicely open-ended, and it leaves a lot for the viewer to think about.\n",

      "One day removed from seeing this film, I feel i have mulled it over it my head enough to comment on it.  Having waited months to see it, I was worried that I was going to be disappointed, as is the case with most of the movies I allow myself to get excited about.  This was not the case here.\n",
      "Long story short, Jim Carey stars as Joel, a quiet reserved man who wakes one morning and decides he is not going to work.  He is drawn to the beach where he meets a mysterious woman named Clementine, (played by the beautiful and gifted Kate Winslet) whom he feels like he has met before.  We are eventually led to a clinic known as Lacuna Inc. where a mysterious procedure can be done to remove painful memories, and here is where the story really takes off.The story drew me in in such a way that I was hoping it would continue indefinitely.  The camerawork is quite chaotic and surreal, having been shot almost entirely on handhelds, and to serve the purpose of a dreamlike state. In this, it succeeds with flying colors.  The viewer will really feel like he or she is walking around in Joel's subconcious.  Big kudos to the team of Gondry and Kaufman.As for the performances, Jim Carey has come a long way from talking with his ass.  His performance here is nothing short of beautiful.  He speaks with a quiet reserve that is so different from his usual, \"in your face,\" antics. But where he really shines is when he's not speaking at all.  Carrey's acting with his eyes is simply heartbreaking at times.  His wistful pain comes across quite clearly.Kate Winslet, playing opposite Carey, is at her usual form.  I have to say, I was not fond of her character at first, but as the story goes on, the viewer sees more and more of a tenderness in her and grows to sympathize for her.The supporting cast is kept to a select few characters but is just as strong.  We have the underrated Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Mierzwiak at Lacuna who jumps back and forth between grandfatherly and shady.  Elijah Wood, fresh off a run as Frodo goes 180¬∫ in the other direction as the creepy Patrick. Kirsten Dunst plays the sweet and forlorn Mary with an honesty I've not seen from her since Interview With the Vampire.  Finally, one of Hollywood's best kept secrets, Mark Ruffalo brings some smiles and laughs as Stan, the loveable nerd overseeing Joel's treatment.I gave this movie 9/10 and I am looking forward to seeing it again.\n",

      "This movie was beautifully edited, acted, written and, at times, directed. Every filmmaker should see it.  It is a serious picture.  Unfortunately, the story did not support a full length feature.  There were many enjoyable scenes that dripped with brilliance, but they merely punctuated an otherwise soporific experience.  One guy in my theater was literally snoring after fifteen minutes.  Kaufman did all he could to inject life into the story with his crafty, cutting edge dialogue, but the main story was so weak, he had to add a number of subplots, which provided distraction, but not substance. Next time, I hope that Michael Gondry will devote his considerable talent to linear story-telling.  It's not so bad.\n",
      "1817\n",
      "This movie had everything that a good movie should have. drama, comedy, romance, imagination, good performances from all of the actors, and a very creative storyline. In fact, the only thing that I could find wrong with it was that they didn't play ELO's \"mr blue sky\" like they did in the trailer. oh well, Kaufman has done it again-he's delivered a wild, crazy romp through an interesting world, with a sci-fi situation, but characters that are more believable than five Bad Boys 2's. I liked this one better than any of Kaufman's other efforts, although I did like all of Kaufman's other films. It reminded me quite a bit of Being John Malkovich, with all of this stuff going on in Carrey's mind. the operation lasted a lot longer than I thought it would, as it covered more than half of the film. But that was one of the best parts, in fact, it was probably the best part, especially when you see Carrey and Winslet going through his memories trying to dodge the erasers who are doing the operation on him. He realizes that he loves Winslet, and that he doesn't want her deleted from his memory. One of the most hilarious moments of the film is when Carrey is trapped in his child's body with his own adult head. Charlie Kaufman's scripts, as wild as they get, always seem to have a little insight or emotional core around them. With Being John Malkovich, is was trying to be somebody you're not to get what you want, it was the element of disguise in humans. with Adaptation, it was the brotherly love and of trying to get that creative membrane fired. With Confessions of a Dangerous Mind it just seemed to be the fact that when you do something bad, you may hate yourself later for doing it. this film has the biggest emotional core of all of his films, as Joel, Jim Carrey's character, tries to stop Clemintine (kate winslet) from being erased from his memory. a brilliant masterpiece and wonderful achievement in filmmaking. ****\n",

      "I really, really did like this movie.  But I guess my expectations were too high, seeing as I had been waiting for it for approximately four months before it's release, and I think I mentally over-hyped it.  Stylistically, it was flawless.  However, I think it was intended to be one of those movies that doesn't make sense until towards the very end, but somehow me and my best friend figured out exactly what was going on within the first twenty minutes, and we were right...  So, yeah, certain parts sort of dragged on because they were supposed to be hints of what was happening, but if you already know, it's just like, \"Get on with it already.\"9 out of 10 stars, though. See it.\n",

      "This film was so imaginative and full of creativity, it is hard to stop thinking about it far after you walk out of the theater. Just let your mind relax, and absorb the wonderful film that \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is. I have been waiting to see this movie since last year (2003), and it was everything I expected it to be. It stretches reality, but still bases the whole movie on human nature. Charlie Kaufman has done a wonderful job creating this story, and his characters are very distinct and unique. The effects and brain \"teasers\" in this movie are awesome, and the music just adds to the feel of it. This movie is definitely a \"must-see\" for all those who are tired of the same old movies being repeated over and over, just with different characters and settings. You'll be in awe when you walk out of the theater. GO SEE IT!!!\n",
      "1820\n",
      "I saw \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" last night, thinking that it was going to be an entertaining, yet hard to follow, movie. It was, but it had something more than that to it. Anyone who sees the movie can understand the basic concept of this movie. Jim Carrey meets Kate Winslet who in turn begin dating, then break up, and have their memories of each other erased. Yet, underneath it all, this movie is one giant love story. If you think about it hard enough, that's ALL this movie is, and it is deeply touching. And even though they try to erase one another, in the end, they were meant to be. And no memory loss, or brain damage as they call it in the movie, can stop true love.\n",
      "1821\n",
      "First things first, THIS IS NOT A COMEDY.  It's not a drama either, but I would have to compare it to a more entertaining and energetic \"Lost in Translation\" in terms of general feeling.  Just don't want people to be \"confused\" by the marketing of this movie. It's beautiful, and brilliant but not the comedy it's being sold as.  It's a story of love, fate, and essential being.That said, it's one of the best movies I've seen all year. At first you'll need to take a leap of faith and be a bit patient as the story is laid out. Not quite like Memento, but if you've seen that you'll get my drift: stay with it and pay attention.Jim Carey plays Joel.  His life story is not well drawn, but suffice to say he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet) and gradually grows a realistically important and quite touching relationship with her.  As the trailer shows, things start to turn bad between them and Joel decides to get the memory of her erased.During this process he's confronted with her memories and has to deal with the loss and joy of their relationship.  Would you erase the good with the bad?  Would you want to remember good times despite bitter feelings and regret?This movie is Kate Winslet's best work.  She's vivacious as usual and provides her best human qualities to date.  Jim Carey is very subdued and it works pefectly in this context. Kirsten Dunst provides the surprise performance as the doctors assistant.Ultimately it's a movie that will force you to think about the value of accepting the good and bad. Drugs, alcohol, psychology, and evenutally medical procedures can help you forget the pain and dispare of being in love and failing, but would you really want to forget?\n",
      "1822\n",
      "There were so many reasons to not like the movie.  I haven't enjoyed a Jim Carrey movie since I was in High School.  Kate Winslet is a non-factor in my mind.  Kirsten Dunst is rather annoying.  Add to that the fact that I didn't even really enjoy Charlie Kaufman's other two movies.  With all of these things working against this movie I went simply because it was such a good concept. I am so glad that I went.  I thought the acting was terrific.  Especially from Jim Carrey.  Anyone who could appreciate Adam Sandler's transformation in Punch Drunk Love will be equally impressed by Jim Carrey here.  If you prefer \"Little Nicky\" to \"Punch Drunk Love\", then this movie isn't for you. The humor is not the over the top brand of humor that Carrey has done in the past.  It is subtle and endearing. I don't understand people complaining that it didn't make sense.  I didn't find anything in the movie that didn't line up.  It was beautifully written and crafted.  It did drag a little bit at times, but the last half-hour was perfection.  I didn't know what direction they were going to go in the end, but I couldn't have liked it better any other way then it was.  A very good movie.  Probably not for everybody, but for the people who saw the trailer and were intrigued...you need to follow up on your instincts.  The movie won't let you down.\n",
      "1823\n",
      "First of all I must say that this movie had amazing performances, and amazing direction, making for one of the best movies to come out recently. Jim Carry's performance is, while at times typical of Jim Carry; his performance contains a sense of loss and tragedy, creating an amazing character.  Kate Winslet did very well in this film as well, but can not compare to the caliber of Carry's performance. The plot of the movie is unique, and intriguing to me.  After a bad relationship Jim Carry's character decides to have his memory erased, and from there the movie gets a little wild.  The cinematography was very well done, and Michel Gondry's directing is top notch.  At times the film is very hard to follow, but if you make it through the first hour or so, the movie becomes a wonderful treat for the mind.  My only complaint with the film is that of the ending, although most of the people I've talked to have no problem with it, I found it a bit disappointing.  Not because it didn't fit, but because the movie was going so far and then at the end to me it's a bit too happy.  It by no means ruins the film, however I personally felt the ending could have been better. 4/5 stars\n",
      "1824\n",
      "In a way, I feel like the plot was full of intentional holes.  I do not think it is necessary for people to understand every detail of what went on in order to understand the point.  The metaphor for an emotional process was beautifully executed.  The self-reflexivity was enormous, sometimes frustrating, but fascinating nonetheless.On that note, the direction and cinematography were excellent, although the handheld shots became slightly enduring.  The editing complemented the metaphor constructively, but was overemphasized at times.The acting was on par, with Jim Carrey delivering a fair amount of skill. Elijah Wood, on the other hand, did not add much.I'll have to see how I feel about it the second time around, but for now I loved the ambiguous storyline.10/10\n",

      "1. I adore Jim Carrey in this film. 2. Kate Winslet is bound to win something for her role in this film. 3. I was annoyed more than entertained by that Dunst actress and even Elijah Wood. Maybe I was just in a bad mood? haha.This movie is a MUST see. It makes you question what you would do in a similar situation. It was well written and the scenes, while sometimes strange and confusing, were beautiful. This movie was full of humor, love, and some sadness.\n",
      "1826\n",
      "In response to reviewer who claimed this movie is \"no Truman Show\", I could not agree more; it is far superior. This is Kaufman's most rewarding work and contains some of the most beautiful moments I have ever witnessed in filmaking. That said, it is not a perfect film. The flow is awkward at times, and it's definitely hard on the hind after awhile, but it is overall extremely gratifying and worth every minor pain. I'll leave it at that, except to say that if you are looking for something more than just mindless entertainment, and would like to see a love story that is original and truly thought-provoking, then go see this movie. 3 1/2 stars.\n",
      "1827\n",
      "If any of you know me and talk to me away from the message boards, you more than likely know that my personal favorite film of all time is Memento. When I first saw that movie, it just blew me away. I became obsessed with the concept and the film itself. It's been a few years ago since I first saw Memento in the theater, and I didn't think that I'd ever see a film that I enjoyed more than Memento, especially already.However, with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I might just be able to say just that. After months of waiting for this one to be released, I finally was able to check it out tonight.Wow.I've seen Memento over and over again, so I can't really say for sure that I enjoyed Eternal Sunshine more, but I do believe that once I watch it a few more times to really let everything sink in, I'll be able to say it without a doubt.I checked this film out right before I saw Dawn of the Dead (yep, double duty for me tonight), and the first thought I had after leaving the theater was that I might as well not even watch another film for a while, because no way in hell could anything even come close to the perfection of Eternal Sunshine.Charlie Kaufman is a freaking genius. From Being John to Adaptation and now this, I've decided the guy is not only screwed up in the head, but he is also a genius, period. He's just such a great writer. I've loved his work before Eternal, but this script is hands down the best that I have ever read, and it is presented on the big screen perfectly.This film isn't like his other films however, it's much deeper. Eternal is not a gimmick film, it is NOT a comedy. It's a true love story, with a Kaufman feel to it. I could go on and on talking about how perfect this film is in my eyes.The overall film itself isn't the only thing that's so great, as it's so much more than the story. The performances of everyone involved go above and beyond. Jim Carey proves once again to me that he is much more than the physical comedic actor that so many have certified him as without even taking the time to realize that he is capable of so much more than just moving around in an insane way. To me, he's just a damn fine actor. If this film doesn't prove that, then nothing will. He brings forth so many different emotions, in such a sincere way. From fright to antisocial to depression and ultimately to being totally in love.Jim Carey's chemistry with Kate Winslet, his love interest in the film, is just unreal as well. They interact with one another with just such great feel. Carey (Joel) being the antisocial type of guy when he first meets Winslet (Clementine), who is everything but antisocial, the type of woman who is totally forward and is just totally open and free, from the very start they work great together. Even though both have a totally different personality, it works together, and eventually the personalities meet in the middle, forming one hell of a bond between the two characters.The performances of the other main stars, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, and Elijah Wood, also do a great job. Everything just clicks for everyone involved, it's just a great experience on film when you have something like that happen between all of the actors involved.But back to the character of Clementine. I can't remember the last time that I saw a character in a film with such an energy that Clementine shows off. I'd go so far to say that the character is my favorite character ever. I don't know what to say about this other than just that. I could watch that character all day interact with Joel, or anything else.The look of the film, the special effects, the dialogue, the theme, all of the actors, it all fits together perfectly. I know it's clich√©, but it's like a big puzzle where all of the pieces fit together in just the right way.And with Eternal, the film itself really is a huge puzzle.That isn't an exaggeration at all. The film doesn't even click in your mind until about twenty minutes in, but it's in a good way. You just have to see it to understand what I mean.So yeah, I do believe that I have a new \"favorite film of all time\". I could watch this one over and over again, and I know that when I do I'll notice something different each time through.Go check this one out, do NOT allow this film to go unnoticed. I know that it will more than likely not do that great at the box office, as I understand that this isn't the type of thing that the masses would really \"get\". Either way, have it do good or bad at the box office, WE NEED MORE FILMS LIKE THIS IN Hollywood RIGHT NOW. I can't say that enough. In a town working on so many remakes and sequels, it's refreshing to see something as original as Eternal Sunshine come out from the ashes.\n",
      "1828\n",
      "Being John Malkovich was visionary; disturbing; hilarious; charming. Adaptation was weird; satisfying; challenging.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind equals those previous outings with a fascinating journey through a man's memories. Jim Carrey will be described as \"understated\" a million times before this film finishes its run in theatres, and deservedly so. The rubber-limbed heir apparent to Jerry Lewis turns in a finely muted performance here.Kate Winslet, instead, is the wacky off-the-shelf number -- she made *me* fall in and out of love with her during the course of this film. I've enjoyed her in past films but I was absolutely spellbound by her Clementine in Spotless.Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, Thomas Jay Ryan and Tom Wilkinson work for the company that erases things or people from memories -- they're solid but unspectacular as supporting cast. This film is all about Kaufman's wonderful script and Carrey & Winslet's riveting performances.I'm a cynic -- I don't come out of the theatre raving very often. This is one of those times.\n",
      "1829\n",
      "This movie is directed by Michel Gondry, who is one of the most artistic and beautiful minds of our time. The script was written by Charlie Kaufman, who wrote two of the most interesting and talked about movies of the last few years, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. I will say now that I'm the kind of viewer who likes to be confused and unsettled, yet if you are not, please don't let that stop you from seeing this film. To compare and contrast, \"50 First Dates\" this is not. The ins and outs of this relationship is very real, and nothing is compromised to make it a very strange trip. There are no dick or fart jokes to make sure you're still watching, although there is a lot of situational humor that should keep you smiling. Despite how weird this movie is, it will change the way you look at your current relationship, or if you aren't in one, it will make you want to go out and look for the girl of your dreams. It can be a very effective date movie, but I saw it alone in a theatre besides two of my best friends, and it felt as if it was just for us. I walked out of the theatre with a huge smile on my face, like the world was in a new light.To me, this is all film should be. A way to experience something you can't experience otherwise; a trip inside someone's head. \"Being John Malkovich\" did this somewhat, but the details of the romance the pair in the movie had make this movie ten times as intimate and heartfelt. Amongst the sea of \"realistic\" and brutal films like \"The Passion of the Christ\" (which in comparison just left me feeling sore afterwards) it's nice to have a surreal movie like this to take me out of my life for just a few minutes. While the effects of this movie are pretty fantastical, they never seem synthetic like most CGI-generated effects. After all, this is the guy who meticulously made a White Stripes music video entirely out of still shots of legos; which could have been done with CGI... but where's the fun in that? Like has been said before, Michel Gondry will do whatever it takes, no matter how big or small, to make what needs to happen come to life onscreen. And this film, as you will see, was a pretty exhaustive effort. To note another music video director that went feature-film, Tarsem Singh's movie \"The Cell\" maintained the beautiful atmospheric shots of his video work, yet there wasn't enough underneath to make it a truly great film. I believe this film to be the best of both worlds, and can't wait for Charlie Kaufman's next script.I wish I knew whatever is holding you, the reader, back from seeing this film, so I could shoot it down. This is one of Jim Carrey's best performances yet (\"The Truman Show\" was just warming up) and I plan on seeing it again and again. If at any point you feel confused, then maybe that's a good thing, who wants to know every little thing about what's happening and be able to predict the ending? Just take it all in, and by all means, watch it more than once! I plan on it... because this has fulfilled everything I could want from a movie, and just might make it my new favorite movie of all time.\n",
      "1830\n",
      "Just saw this movie today. I rate it an 8 out of 10, which is lower than many others do. I like the movie, and I think the story is absolutely great, and really, really works. But for reasons that I find difficult to define, the movie just didn't *really* grab me. There's something too polished about it. Some kind of charisma missing. For one thing, Jim Carrey's character is incredibly boring (and it's not because I expect him to be a joker like in his other movies; I acknowledge his ability to do serious roles), and one doesn't understand what Kate Winslet's vivacious character sees in him. As delightful as Winslet is in this movie - clearly the best thing in it -, the central insecurity of her character is never thoroughly explored (but then, maybe that was never the point). Still, the story is of a rare multi-layered complexity, and the fact that, at its core, it's a heart-felt love story, makes it all the better.Kirsten Dunst is also great; this may be her greatest performance yet (and that's coming from someone who's not generally a Dunst fan). In fact, the entire supporting cast is very good, even Elijah Wood's shallow/pathetic trickster character. In terms of the story itself, this package is incredibly well-rounded and with artistic integrity to spare. It's hard to find any flaws about it, other than that rather indefinable lack of charisma in the execution. I expect it'll seem better to me in time; already I'm finding myself describing it in my mind as engrossing, although I didn't feel all that engrossed just as I sat in the theater. But I guess I have to relent: Yes, this is a classic movie, and a rare cinematic achievement.8 out of 10 is still as high as I can go, though.\n",

      "its been a long time since i have connected with a movie like this... it was an icredible sciencefiction/comedy/romance/drama movie that has impressed me farther than any film in the my short life. Jim Carrey's performance is so sharp and controlled. I dont know if it is a fluke or not ( jim was great in both man on he moon and the truman show, but nothing else has impressed me, except cable guy, but thats because of stiller, but i digress) but i dont think anyone else could have done as an astounding job on this film as carrey. Kate winslet was just a  firecracker on screen. She was smart, sexy, hysterical, strong, loud, obnoxious, ingenious, temperate, and for me, she just lit up the screen and made me fall in love with her. The supporting cast is strong as well. Wilkinson gives another solid perfomace. Mark ruffalo is a force to be recokened with, and gave a heartwrenching performance/ Elijah wood, though underwritten, is great and it was good seeing outside LOTR, and Kirstin Dunst was phenomenal. I wasnt the biggest fan of her in anything besides Interview with the Vampire, and this was a warm welcome for me. The direction is phenomenal. Gondry makes a cinematic wonder, and its the little thing, like when the labels on the books, and how it was all slowly disappearing and it was just so subtle for me, and the angles of the shots, and the way he seems to be in total control. He could have let the movie spin out of control in joels dreams, but he doesnt. A superb job. The script was incredible. I love the way kaufman writes. it was sooo goood. he just has the speed and flow that no one else does. other highlights- the editing, the cinemtography, and kates hair- i liked it alot.\n",
      "1832\n",
      "What an experience seeing this film.  I came out of this film feeling refreshed, touched and confused! Similar feelings I had when I saw 'Being John Malcovich' and 'Adaptation', two great films from a master screenwriter.  Now Kaufman has created another great story, with quirky characters, as he takes on a rollercoaster ride of the human mind.  His genius shines through here as he challenges us, but never cheats.Jim Carrey masterfully creates a character introverted and lonely to the point when you look in his eyes, you get a feeling of urgency in him.  An urgency to find someone, to talk to someone, to love someone.  His undertones and realism ranks this as one of his best performances, if not his absolute best.Kate Winslet compliments Carrey well in her role.  Clementine (Winslet) is the exact opposite of Joel (Carrey), however they both long for the same thing, to be loved.  And when their love goes totally wrong, we are taken on an odyssey of Joels mind to erase Clementine from his memory (as Clementine did with Joel).  Though the proceedure seems a little far fetched, we forgive the idea and go with it and run.This film is what love is all about.  Can we forever remove events, people and the pain from our past?  Aren't we a product of this?Whatever the case may be, by the end of the film (and I won't say what exactly, so not to wreck anything for those who have not seen it yet),I was surprisingly touched by the end result.  However, I don't want you to think this film has a 'Hollywood' ending because it doesn't.  It's beautiful and doesn't cheat and that's what make this a great film.\n",

      "Take the memory clearing idea of Paycheck, mix in the ambience of Vanilla Sky (excluding the soundtrack, which is very different), and give it a Valentine's day romance and you have this film.  If, for some reason, that sounds negative, it is not intended to be.  The result is a rare beast.  To put it in crude, simple terms, it's a geek movie that's a chick flick.I.e., science fiction meets tear-jerker love story.  And, somehow, it works.The science could improve.  It drops into B-movie devices when it comes to the memory clearing hardware.  Outside of that, it makes the whole system seem like a believable medical procedure that could evolve with a few technological advances.  The human motivation is definitely there, and the film gets a couple of its funniest scenes from focusing on the various people and situations that land them in the doctor's office.The joy, and most of the story, of the film revolves around the problems that arise.  The director wraps it in a thoughtful, hallucinatory package that adds suspense as well.  Finally, all of it is held together by characters that are all well-acted.\n",

      "I'm not the biggest fan of Charlie Kaufman. \"Being John Malkovich\" was creative film, but it was also one I could watch and leave, not having to take the movie with me metaphorically speaking. I didn't quite understand \"Adaptation\" and that pains me, but it was so over my head that I didn't enjoy it. The latest, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is hard to leave. It is such a creative and original film that doesn't make the audience buy into a life-or-death love story or aHollywood ending. I'll admit, the first 30 minutes had me reconsidering choosing this film. It was confusing, abrupt, and about as clear as mud. But once I got the hang of it, it really came together (or didn't!). It has a lot of heart and is a very real and understanding story. The characters go through the same emotionsanybody in a relationship does but don't embellish and dramatize their lives. My cousin explained it very well by saying \"Never have I hated a movie somuch, then loved one at the same time.\"\n",

      "This film is a dazzlingly original and innovative piece of work. The story revolves around the erasure of painful memories from a relationship, and the consequences that can lead out of such a procedure. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are both excellent in the lead roles, Carrey lending weight to an otherwise average role. You have to be concentrating hard to follow a lot of it though, because much of it isnt in the right order, and it jumps between reality, memories and distorted memories. But once youve got the hang of it, you can really appreciate it as one of the most inventive Hollywood pictures in years. In a way, this is to be expected from the mind of Charlie Kaufman, but this film is more complete and satisfactory than his other major achievements, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. It connects on much more of an emotional level than either of those pictures, and by the end leaves you in total admiration for the people who could think up and execute such a marvellous and wondrous film. See it, and then see it again to truly appreciate it.\n",

      "I just walked out of the movie from a midnight screening not knowing anything about the film. The first moment I saw Jim Carrey, I thought, \"Is this going to suck?\"I was very wrong.Carrey gives a solid performance and he breaks out of his comedic casting remarkably. Kate Winslet played her role great as well. But what really captured it, for me, was the storyline, the directing, and the editing.The \"eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\" is about erasing a bad memory. And what worse of a memory is there than an ex-girlfriend?Reflecting on my own relationships, I see the pattern that goes from great pain, to anger, to a desire to sweep-it-under-the-rug, and then finally to thankfulness. A sense of loss is common to each part of the process, but is reacted to in very varying ways. That sense of loss cannot be conveyed in a word or even a moment in time. That's why I am glad that the movie dealt with loss and yearning for the whole film, and in so doing, I felt like it gave a realistic depiction of it.How is loss conveyed on the screen? The editing, storyline, and sound (FX and music) were so sharp and reminiscent of a pure stream-of-conscious, that it really communicated what goes on in my head. Scrambling, focused anger, ambiguity, half-truths and layers upon layers of intentions and interpretations.It reminded me of Requiem for a Dream, where the visuals really gave a sense of what it means to be addicted. And Requiem spent the better part of the moving developing that idea, rather than be plot-driven. Similarly, Eternal Sunshine had a plot, but it didn't seem plot driven. Jim Carrey (Joel) seemed to go exactly where a real-life Joel would be going, rather than to where the audience would like to think of Joel's post-break-up mind would go. That darkness is a bit anti-Hollywood, though I bet there are those who might say that the darkness is slowly becoming Hollywood. Regardless, it is still dark.The delicacy comes in with the nuanced sounds and visual sequences. I came out of the film feeling like there were long periods of very little sound. Certainly, the lack of background music at times really helped the emotional impact reach its full effect. At other times, garbled electronic gibberish and whispers might envelop the scene, gestures toward the Joel's torrid state of mind. It was fast where it needed to be, but more importantly, it had slowness. The resulting rhythms (which, although I know I felt them in the movie, I can't pinpoint how it happens) helped take me and the audience on the ride, guided by this delicate, dark, and beautiful little film.If you dissed the movie because of the trailer, please ignore that impression. The trailer (that I saw) didn't do justice to the movie.\n",
      "1837\n",
      "Ever since I first saw Jim Carrey in the TV-show In Living Color, I knew there was something special about him. It was hardly a surprise to see his movie career take off. What was surprising, were the kind of roles he picked. His early success relied heavily on his rubber face, and it would have been all too easy to stick to movies like Ace, Dumb & Dumber and The Mask. Fortunately for us, he didn't.In The Cable Guy and The Truman Show, he showed that he had no fear to take on more serious, darker material. Those movies were still covered in thick layers of Hollywood plastic, but seemed to hold a promise of better things to come. Even more telling, at least to me, was Carrey's TV-appearance with Ruby Wax. He was more honest, vulnerable and... real than any other guest before him.Still, nothing prepared me for his role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Here, Jim Carrey fulfils his early promise in full. His portrayal of an insecure guy in search of some happiness hits home. This is a breathtaking performance, because we do not see Carrey acting, but just being himself - or so he makes us believe.But let us not focus on just one actor, wonderful (and promising) as his role may be. All the actors in this movie are great. Winslet is simply wonderful. Dunst, Wood, Ruffalo... all are surprisingly good. Even Wilkinson, one of those lesser known actors that you like to tell your friends about, is at the top of his game here.However, this is much more than an actors' movie. Writer Kaufman, co-writer/director Gondry and editor √ìskarsd√≥ttir have together produced a chef d'oeuvre that shows a way out for an industry, stuck in a loop of formulaic, CGI- and special effects-driven fast food. Let us hope that others will pick up the vibe, and not turn this into a new formula, but use it as an inspiration to create more original works of art.\n",

      "This is not a movie to see if you are either a. Currently in a dead-end relationship or b. Just recently ended a dead-end relationship.  It is not a movie to give the viewer a \"feel-good\" experience.  It is much more like real life, where people use each other, not out of malice, but out of loneliness, emptiness and frustration.As the song goes \"You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone\".  Imagine if you could really TOTALLY get rid of someone?  Would you?  Or is there a sense of inevitability to our relationships, that we keep picking the same person (or same type of person) again and again, unable to really make a fresh start?  This movie evokes another song's lyrics for me, \"Swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, running over the same old ground, how we found, the same old fear.\"  (Pink Floyd, not sure of the song's title).These are, in my opinion, the questions that this movie explores.  And answers beautifully.  But again, don't expect to feel wonderful at the end of this movie.  You will see yourself in some or many of these characters, and the look in this cinematic mirror is not pretty.  A brilliant work of fantasy, exploration of the imagery and workings of the inner mind, and of the quiet inner struggles of the average person.  Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are wonderful.  Especially Winslet, who effortlessly dons a convincing American accent, and is a complicated and chameleon-like persona.We never really find out why Carrey's or Winslet's characters are the way they are.  They never really can reveal their true selves, either to each other or to us.\n",

      "The beginning of this film had me wondering if I'd understand it. Seemed as though we'd been dropped in the middle of something big...but what? Once the opening credits began to roll things started making more sense. I don't want to give it away but this is a must watch. With vague overtones of another great movie (Memento), most of this is filmed in a backward sort of state and though a bit confusing, the mind does adjust. The performances by both Winslet and Carrey were excellent and clearly well thought out and practiced. Funny, sad at times and original, this is well worth watching at least once, if not repeatedly.8/10\n",

      "I've really become an enormous fan of Charlie Kaufman's over the past few years and this movie is no let down. It's got his mind game feel all over it. It's encouraging that we have an American writer with such original thought. Jim Carey is really good in this role; in my opinion much better than in his other serious roles (Truman Show, Man on the Moon) and Kate Winslet is excellent as well. The quality supporting cast are quite good. The director does a fine job with the visual tricks involved in the film. He succeeds in creating the seamless effect of being in someone's memories.Great flick.\n",

      "I saw this at a pre-screening and I can't decide how I feel about this movie.  I keep thinking back to the TV ads trying to decide what kind of movie this really is.  Is it a comedy?  Is it a romantic comedy?  I know one thing, it is very original.Nothing in this movie to me was laugh out loud funny, although several times the audience did laugh.  I feel like this movie was something more than a comedy and perhaps I missed the point completely.Either way this movie is worth seeing if you are looking for a movie which is challenging to understand.  Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet were quite good.I don't think this is quite on par with Adaptation and Being John Malkovich but it will certainly be better than some of the other slop slated for release this year.\n",

I'll leave it at that so I don't ruin it for anyone. 2. Jim Carrey is way underrated as an actor. I agree with the other post that said he should do more drama. 3. Kirsten Dunst makes a HOT stoner. 4. Charlie Kaufman is the master of creating gawky, socially awkward characters. This movie is no exception.Go see this movie.\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine represents the moment that Charlie Kaufman finally came into his own. After utterly blowing the third acts of both Adaptation and Being John Malkovitch, and falling asleep behind the wheel of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Kaufman has, at long last, created a complete film, a unified vision in which not one word could be changed without somehow compromising the whole. If anyone is the man, the new heir to Paul Shrader (in terms not of style but of overall importance and critical value), then it's Charlie Kaufman.Many debts are of course owed to magic realism--the literary genre to which the film belongs, and the genre Kaufman specializes in inhabiting. Behind every Kaufman script lurks the long shadows of Borges, Marquez and Calvino. Many other debts are owed to the stellar performance of Jim Carrey, whose career can now boast three decent films (this one, Man on the Moon and Truman), and whose agent, if equipped with any brains whatsoever, would advocate that Jim latch onto director Michel Gondry's ankles with a vise-like death grip in the hopes of obtaining a future role. Even the supporting cast is exemplary, for example, Kate Winslet's neurotic, immature, flakey and alcoholic character is entirely convincing.Perhaps Michel Gondry is the real deal. Unlike MTV stablemate Spike Jonze, who should either put up or shut up, and either make a complete film or head back to the 3 minute movie, Gondry has cast away the narrower limitations of music video and created a real film--not that his work with the Chemical Brothers, Massive Attack or Bjork is in any way unimportant or unimpressive, but the format does impose its own limitations. Whatever the case, Gondry, like Kaufman, has arrived and perhaps the contributions of the two cannot be separated.The film itself? It is perfect. It is flawless. Out of the 1500 films I have reviewed, I have only seen thirteen films that have earned 10/10.\n",
      "1844\n",
      "Quirky, entertaining, and at times wonderful, Charlie Kaufman's scripts for \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\" were harbingers of a great talent. His new film is a step up: it's beyond fun and promise. There are glimpses here of the compelling brilliance, complexity and lasting impact of a Tom Stoppard, a Dennis Potter. Kaufman has arrived.But first, there are a couple of obstacles to overcome. The first is the title. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is neither good marketing nor something that makes sense. Just get over it. (And remember that both \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" and \"The Vertical Rays of the Sun\" triumphed over their awkward, heliotropic handles.)Second, disregard the advertising that punches up the science-fiction/Matrix-like theme of erasing memories of a relationship. Just auto-erase all the negative expectations that come up as the result. \"Eternal Sunshine\" is not about special-effects razzle-dazzle; it's about people. The writing, Michel Gondry's direction, gripping performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet combine to make it a treasure.\n",
      "Sitting in the theater, not wanting the film to end, I remembered the major squirming through the endless video game of \"The Return of the King,\" the obscene, sacrilegious sado-masochism of \"The Passion of the Christ.\" Those two box-office wonders don't have a glimmer of the humanity and excellence of \"Eternal Sunshine\" - let's just hope that it gets an audience.\n",
      "1845\n",
      "I came in with high expectations of this movie simply from the trailer's Mr. Blue Sky.  I was pleasantly surprised that the movie actually passed my expectations.Carrey has his best performance in a drama since Truman Show and his chemistry with Winslett is actually quite good. The two are complete opposites in character but make the relationship believeable and emotional.\n",
      "The camerawork says it all for this movie, constantly going out of focus and whipping from one spot to the next accurately show how a persons mind or train of thought actually functions. The entire working of effect and graphics between memories and erasure of memories is done well.The story is able to make you feel which says something about a movie.  I left the movie with a similar feeling as to how I felt leaving Big Fish. Overall it's an outstanding movie and I hope the actors, even David Cross, get the credit and recognition they deserve. I walked away with a great movie and an Eternal Sunshine orange hoodie that Winslett wears throughout the movie.  3 cheers for advance screenings!9/10\n",
      "1846\n",
      "\"Masterpiece\" would be an odd word to describe any new script written by Charlie Kaufman.  After all, in his brief career he has penned screenplay after brilliant screenplay--from \"Being John Malkovich\" to \"Adaptation\" to \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" (we'll except here \"Human Nature,\" because I have yet to see it [and it doesn't appear to be too popular]).  How, then, could anything he writes now be considered a masterpiece?Well, riddle me this: what if Kaufman took any of his brilliantly imaginative metaphysical premises, and added a dash of the intensely personal?The answer? \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" naturally.  This film marks Kaufman's first foray into a genre no one would have guessed he would dare set foot in, namely the romantic comedy.  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are cast as star-crossed lovers, each of whom utilizes the services of Lacuna Inc., a company that eliminates all memories specific to another person.  It is a revolutionary process, but an experimental one, and when it goes awry... well, that's where our story begins and immediately veers off into territory I can't tell you about lest I spoil it.This film is quite bittersweet, and remarkably universal.  It's nice to see the screenwriter focus on a very human story after a chain of sarcastic romps through, say, writer's block (\"Adaptation\") and vicarious living as a means of escapism (\"Malkovich\").  The same goes for director Michel Gondry, who has always walked on the surreal side as well.  That is not to say that this product of their collaboration is not surreal, as it certainly is, but that it takes pains not to leave its audience behind for too long--to use an old cliche, it spends as much time with its feet on the ground as with its head in the clouds.  The result is a movie that is to long-standing couples what \"Lost In Translation\" is to friends who aren't quite looking for something more.Meanwhile, Jim Carrey turns out his best performance since the \"Truman Show\"/\"Man in the Moon\" days, and Kate Winslet her best since... actually, when was her last movie?  Seems like it's been a while.  Welcome back, Kate, and great work.  Oh yeah--loved you in \"Quills.\"Finally, as an aside to Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson fans: don't be alarmed, as your favorite actors do a wonderful job.  Sadly for you, though, this is pretty strictly a two-character film, and the folks who work for Lacuna are really only there to further the story of the leads.  Mind you, it's an honorable task, I assure you.In summary, while only time will tell how it will be received by the general public (I write having just returned from a preview), we can all sleep easy knowing that another opus has been added to the Kaufman canon.  Soon we will have no choice but to accept that he owns us all.\n",
      "1847\n",
      "This is the kind of movie that everyone should partake in, at least once. The charismatic Jim Carrey performs a new side of himself that the likes of no one has seen before, and we see a new side of Kate Winslet, as well. She plays the Carrey role (outlandish, silly, fun), and he plays the Winslet role (reserved, sweet). Definitely not the kind of movie to bring a date out on, this is reserved for times of remembrance to things that were, happiness in old memories, a smile and a tear for something that once was. Eternal Sunshine has completely flip flopped the way I think about films, and I'm still surprised that Carrey had not received a best actor nod in the year it'd come out.Complete perfection, every step of the way.\n",

      "Someone was asking what this movie is about. It is about mature relationships. It is about what it is like to be in love and live together.It is about how a relationship is full of ups and downs and sometimes ups will get thrown out with the downs but if you do that you throw away something incredibly precious. It is a warning: If you are going to erase only erase the bad. It also hints about the way that when you love someone they start to fill your entire existence, past present and future. In the movie it is as an attempt to prevent her from being erased from his mind. Maybe that is why it happens in real life too? That's what its about.\n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a good/great science fiction film with lots of memorable scenes.  It's about the implications of technology that doesn't exist - yet - a device that wipes out selected memories.  In this case, Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) want to wipe out all memories of their relationship with each other.  This action on their parts has a lot of unforeseen consequences, and Charlie Kaufman explores this.The most amazing sequences in this film are the scenes where Jim Carrey actively watches his memories falling apart and being erased.  Though there are a few plot flaws and a few things I just didn't buy (such as the \"party\" sequence), the brilliance of this film overshadows any blemishes or imperfections.  The twists and turns, the unpredictability, and above all the originality of Kaufman's script make this a real winner.  Worth seeing twice!\n",

      "Enough cannot be said about Jim Carrey's performance in this movie.  A wonderful movie, by the way, and everyone was excellent in it, but Jim Carrey really made the \"Jim Carrey\" we all know disappear.  Will he be remembered by the time the Oscars roll around again?I would like to see this movie get nominated for best picture.  This is what great movies are about...not overblown epics with great visuals and no substance (you know what movie I mean!)  And speaking of LOTR, this film proves once again that whether he is a hobbit or a technical assistant, Elijah Wood cannot be trusted to get the job done!  Perhaps Wood should get more snarky roles like this.  He is so good at it.  I'd like to see him play someone truly evil.\"Nice\" to see a movie where even the tiny roles are so well-cast.

      "Charlie Kaufman appears to be the heir apparent to the legacy of Philip K. Dick, and nowhere is this more evident than with ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.  It's not just that this is Jim Carrey's best film.  It's not even that this is the best film of 2004 so far.  This film is the best film of the 21st century so far.Kaufman's explorations of the twists and turns both of reality and (by extension) the human mind has never been more brilliantly realized.  But beyond that, this film captures more than any film I have ever seen the importance of personal human memory.  How it can be manipulated.  How it can define a person.  But most importantly, how valuable it is to us all, good or bad.What a wonderful fable this is for the present day.  For those with open enough minds, it has an almost SIXTH SENSE pull to be re-watched, so one can fully understand how the excellent plot construction actually pulls you into it's world.  After all, it makes you question during the film if you remembered previous scenes correctly, only to reveal the manipulation of memory at the end.  Wonderful!\n",

      "I think Kauffman (in collaboration with Gondry) has pushed the envelope yet again with genre and structure.  The result is a completely inventive and fresh take on a pretty basic love story: 2 lovers break up, then get back together again.  Conventional, until you account for how Kauffman tells it.  He gets lots of mileage out of the \"memory erasing\" plot device and Gondry has a great time editing the story like a Mobius strip (one of those endless looping stories where the beginning is the end and the end is the beginning).  (The images Gondry wrings out of the script are pretty great too).  Along the way we get a love story between 2 very different people with lots of ups and downs, who ultimately decide they can't live without each other.  Though it's never preachy (and that's the beauty of it), Kauffman is saying even though relationships can start off like mad-crazy love and often wind up boring-blase, that's the glory of it.  It ain't perfect.  I hate to make the comparison, but it's like \"Memento,\" only with heart.\n",

A number of people in the theater spoke as ifthey hated it at the end, one said \"Blair Witch made more since than that!\" It does seem as if the movie is slow to start, but even in parts that seemed slow I was drawn to watch and not look away for fear of missing something.    Once we enter Joel's memory is when a smile came on my face and didn't leave the rest of the picture.  I was completely into the movie, you probably could have shot me in the chest and I wouldn't have taken my eyes off the screen.  The movie was so different, so un-hollywood, so unlike the three comic book movies coming soon to theaters sometime this year that were being advertised in the lobby, it was a movie that almost dared you to think about the ideas it presented and expand on it.    10/10\n",

      "Eternal Sunshine is a cleverly crafted film put together by an entourage of gifted artists. The script is superb. The film contains the element of memory, an item that has been popular in films since the wonderous Memento put it to good use.  What if you could erase someone out of your life and have no recollection of any events, thoughts, ideas, epiphanies, love, spite, anger, revenge... foregiveness...? Sounds absurd? The film tries to make us believe that some people would risk an unsafe \"unwarranted\" brain scanner to probe areas of their mind...manipulating time and emotion. Somehow, it works.  There is a marvel to the idea and the film pulls off a unique exploration of it as we walk at times through the mind of Carrey and yearn for him to beat the system and save his only happiness, Kate Winslet who reacts terrifically to Carrey's dopish goofiness.The two main characters are loners-losers displaced amongst society's structure yet managing to cope and survive in tight surroundings.  They are uneducated and have no structure.  They bring each other happiness in a brief period of time and their inner demons tear them apart leaving them bitter. Unable to cope they both seek removal of each other from their memories.How they paid for this complicated procedure one has to wonder. Winslet has forgotten him but Carrey is hanging on to his memories and running with Winslet through the passages of his mind and emotions. It touches the heart. There is something wicked under the surface.  The manipulation of time and emotion by the hand of man can be a very dangerous act.  The characters contributing to the act are also displaced yet educated. Their lack of ethics was appauling and might be allegorical to certain ethics in science today. Within their circle lies nasty secrets and suddenly their is an evil present and that is the manipulation of time and emotion.\n",
      "Eternal Sunshine dealt with quite a number of relationship issues, most of them petty little nags that in consistent display can lead to contempt. All they needed was a break and if they wanted their memories erased why not just erase the bad ones.  There is good feeling in the end but do not let the truth get smothered by the facade.This is a wonderful film. Intriguing and refreshing. ****\n",

The experience of watching this brilliant kaleidoscope of a film for me is best compared to seeing a painting that immediately touches you deep down in your heart. The directing is magical and does justice to the magnificent screenplay. The acting all around is also top bar. Jim Carrey disserves special attention for his incredibly well done job. He plays his most endearing character to date and does so flawlessly. If he is not on the list of Oscar nominees next year then something is seriously wrong. To many aspects (music, cinematography, etc.) of this film deserve words said about them for me to make this review a reasonable length. So I will say this: The movie was a moving love story told an incredibly original and beautiful way.\n",

      "Charlie Kaufman has got to be the strangest person alive but thankfully he channels his energy into writing stories for films that are not only complicated to watch but difficult to explain. This story is about a shy and introverted man named Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) who one day meets an outgoing and extroverted woman named Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). They end up having a relationship but one day it all goes wrong and they split up. Joel wants her back but discovers that she has had him erased from her memory. He finds out that a company called Lacuna is behind this and he decides that he also wants to go through the procedure and have Clementine erased from his own memory. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Joel meets Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) at Lacuna and starts the procedure with the help from his assistants Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood). A computer is hooked up to a helmet that Joel wears while asleep and a monitor points out specific areas of his brain that harbor memories of Clementine. While asleep his subconscious has second thoughts and decides that he doesn't want to forget her. Joel and his memories of Clementine try to hide in other memories but keep getting found until time runs out. Dr. Mierzwiak has a past with his nurse Mary (Kirsten Dunst) who's memory was erased and when she finds out she decides to send Joel and Clementine their files so that they know what has happened to them.\n",
      "This film is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed \"Human Nature\" that was written by Kaufman also. Most of the film is an assortment of scenes where Carrey and Winslet talk to each other about their relationship while the outer structure of his memory seems to be caving in around them. In one scene the two of them are in Joel's kitchen when he was four years old with his mother and then in the next shot they're at the beach where they supposedly met for the first time. This film could be described as an exercise in style but it's more about the script than the visuals and it works on both levels. Kaufman has this uncanny knack of writing about dysfunctional people and really showing how their thought process works. His stories dissect the inner workings of these characters and by the end of the film the viewer usually has a good understanding of these people. Like \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\" this is a film that requires your constant attention and it is a challenging viewing but that's what films are suppose to be like. Carrey again is showing that he can play serious roles even though he is still funny in certain scenes here and he's very good with this complex character. Winslet seems to be perfectly cast as the outgoing Clementine and she reminded me a little of Melanie Griffith in \"Something Wild\". In this world of contrived, shallow, and predictable Hollywood films Charlie Kaufman is a welcome addition. No, he's a godsend. I can't wait until this mad genius gives us more of his ideas and true film lovers (like myself) can view something interesting.\n",

      "Seeing the trailer for \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" made me want to go see the movie.  The plot seemed deep and the music in the trailer added to the effect.  Yet when I get excited to see a movie, I'm often disappointed because my expectations are too high to be fulfilled.  Yet without further ado, I must say that \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" was exactly what I wanted it to be and more.First of all, the ensemble cast in \"Eternal Sunshine\" is excellent and they all do a phenomenal job of acting.  Also, Michael Gondry's direction combined with Ellen Kuras' cinematography cause the movie to have an almost surreal atmosphere.  Charlie Kaufman's screenplay added to the bizarre effect, using voiceovers and dialogue at the right times in the right scenes.  The music by Jon Brion and the other music by various artists also fit the movie perfectly.  Furthermore, the origins of the title, which are revealed in the movie, make the viewer think.It is this effect (causing one to think) that makes this movie brilliant.  I guarantee, whether you like this movie or not, you will be thinking about this film from beginning to end, trying to figure out how it all fits together and why it fits as neatly as it does.  I usually have some complaints about movies, even brilliant ones like this, but I can think of none, except that I may have to see it more than once to fully understand it.But then again, that is what makes a movie excellent.  And this movie is exactly that: excellent.Final Grade: A+.\n",

      "I'm entering my seventh year of marriage, as I write this.  We've come a long way: first kiss, first night, first night on the couch, first fight, first compromise, first last apology, first marriage, first kid... there aren't many firsts left for us, and even fewer I want to experience.  Love's old hat.  But love with this imperfectly perfect woman is what I want most of all.I bring this up because ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND reminded me of these things.  The other reviews have already mentioned of the film's prowess and its explorations of the themes of love and memory.  I do think that it is an excellent concept executed impressively.  (If you're not into 'arty' movies, they used a similar story in an episode of \"That 70's Show.\") I also think a well-timed video release should ensure some Oscar nominations next year. But the reason I bring up my own baggage in this comment is to explain why I think this movie resonated so well with me.  I can't think of the last time I saw a film offer this kind of complex and unflattering portrait of romantic love, and still make it seem like the glue of the universe. \n",

      "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is the best adaptation of a story that Philip K. Dick never wrote.  There's glimpses of movies actually inspired by Dick, like \"Paycheck\"and \"Total Recall,\" as well as elements from \"The Neverending Story\" with its encroaching \"nothing\" to \"Groundhog Day\" to Pinter's \"Betrayal\" or \"Memento,\"and the various permutations of \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan.\" \n",
      "But it's altogether completely original in the inventive writing imagination of Charlie Kaufman and visualization by video-maker Michel Gondry, known more up to now for illustrating Bjork's odd songs. Yes, it takes awhile to quite figure out what's going on until you can sort out what's contemporaneously happening before your eyes, what's dream, what's memory, what's fantasy, and what's flashback -- within a one-person \"Rashomon\" roller coaster ride we literally see the tricks memory plays that allow people to fall in love with people who bring out something new in them, and then try to stay in or out of love with them. \n",
      "Almost every actor plays against their usual type -- here Kate Winslet is the kooky, spontaneous one, even more so than in \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Hideous Kinky\" (tracking her hair colors helps you track the film's trajectory and her British accent only slips through twice), Jim Carrey is the serious, shy introvert (though his comedic talents fit nicely as the character incongruously explores the hidden recesses of his subconscious), and Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are nerds living vicariously, though Kirsten Dunst is a similar nymphet as in \"Bring It On.\"Unlike most of the films this borrows from, \"Eternal Sunshine\" has a humanistic heart -- yes, love hurts, but we wouldn't trade a moment of the pain for the pleasure it brings.  And well-worth seeing again to try and remember it better. Lovely score by Jon Brion that helps ratchet up the tensions without overwhelming them.  While the LIRR is used nicely as a setting and metaphor, I'm not 100% convinced that the suburban scenes were filmed in what they claim is Rockville Centre, LI, as it looked more like parts of NYC to me -- which would be a nice change for Queens or wherever standing in for another locale.\n",

      "This is one great film. I went to see this movie expecting a little more of a conspiracy plotline. I am so glad to say that it is far from that.Michael Gondry will forever remain one of the most original filmakers in the history of motion pictures. His story's are like taking a hay ride through surrealism. One would be absolutely thrilled at the marvels he has  made for the screen. I myself enjoy Mr. Gondry's work on a regular basis.Okay. The movie itself is well put together. At first you may fell like \"Where the heck are we going with this?\", but then two seconds later you'll find that what you have just seen makes perfect sense. The movie seems to take a u-turn at one point. This causes you to see the whole film in a different perspective. Wether or not Mr. Gondry does this on purpose could mean the difference between blind luck or pure genius.The acting. I have never seen a better performance by Mr. Jim Carrey. I say this with absolute sincerity. I am completely serious. I can honestly say that Mr. Carrey made an absolute believable character in this film. I have never seen him perform a character like this. Carrey can act. I mean he can act. The things his character does and says. The expressions on his face alone were so real that at one point during the movie I forgot I was watching Jim Carrey on the silver screen. All that I have just said applies to Kate Winslet. Her performace shook me up. She hasn't played a character like that and I personally think that this film will do wonders for her career. As for the rest of the cast...wonderful. Tom Wilkinson seems to deliver a great performance without lifting a finger. I have never seen Mark Ruffalo really. I don't know much about him, but from what I have seen he can act. Kirsten Dunst was absolutley phenomenal as a character. I think she is a better character actor than a lead actor. She has the ability to carry a story as a minor character in a film. Elijah Wood as always is fantastic. Mr. Wood has made quite a career for himself in hollywood. I expect great things to come of his success.To wrap up this rather thrown together review, I can only end it by saying: GREAT FILM, PHENOMENAL DIRECTOR, PLEASANTLY REAL ACTING, DELIGHTFUL STORY. See this movie now you euphoric hungry person you.\n",

      "Jim Carrey is truly outstanding, as is Kate Winslet -the supporting actors are all up to the same great performances as Carey and WInslet.Like \"Adaptation\" the point gets repeated too many times, but at least in this movie it's not as repetitive as in Adaptation( the endless ending). It's too bad, both are great movies with wonderful plots and styles, but why belabor them? - An excellent movie despite the slight dragging or repetitiveness, starting a little after the second half of the movie.\n",
      "1863\n",
      "This film perfectly portrays the simultaneous love and hate you feel at the end of a relationship.Anyone who has loved and lost will be able to understand this movie perfectly.All of the actors did a wonderful job, and Jim Carrey didn't do ANY \"Jim Carrey-isms\" that didn't fit in with the movie.  (Thankfully.)  Charlie Kaufman, as usual, came up with an original and moving idea.  Kate Winslet did a FANTASTIC job - even when I hated Clementine, I was in love with her, just as Joel felt.  Kirsten Dunst's plot twist was handled expertly, and just added more feeling to the movie.It was a great film.\n",

Two of the people I was with had to leave the theater because they felt so queezy.Some amazing writing and dialogue.  Does the Nietzsche quote allude to an existential meaning?  They know that their relationship is not good.  However, by knowing that, they are still free to choose to be in that relationship.  I.e. their relationship is beyond good and evil?What was the significance of Elijah Wood's character doing the same thing to Clementine as the senior assistant to Kerstin Dunce's character?\n",

      "It's unheard of for me to sit down in a regal theater and sit through TV! commercials (yuck!) which cheapens the experience, then come out after watching the film without 20 things I can immediately point out wrong with the picture. This one was different. A+ writing, A+ Acting and A+ directing. Amazing Orchestration of filmmaking, props to actors and extra props to Winslet whom I believe carried most of the film.wow, good movie...finally. Take a hint Hollywood, it pays to be cerebral for some people, and portray emotion accurately. If you know films, and aren't the Jerry Brockheimer type, you should see it.\n",

      "Wow. What a film.(Spoilers herein)This movie takes a little while to get going, and then there are moments when it lags. The reason for this is clear: with the exception of the ending, all the scenes that aren't inside Carrey's brain are disappointing. Fortunately, the vast majority of the movie is inside his brain, and these scenes really shine. Carrey is an unbelievable actor.This film is about many things, but it boils down to fate, love, and the pain we're willing to put ourselves through to get love. Carrey and Winslet are total polar opposites, but they belong together. They fall in love, fight, break up, erase their memories, and fall in love again. And then when they discover they've been in love before and ended up breaking each other's hearts, they stay together anyway. Why? Because that's love. You can't predict it. You can't fight it. You can't stop it. And you shouldn't try.There are only two parts of this movie that I would change. First is the side story of Mary (the receptionist) and the doctor. It really drags down the rest of the film, and it's a totally unnecessary because it's just a plot device to set it up so that Winslet and Carrey find out they've fallen in love before. And that's the other thing I would change. Since the real point is that they fell in love all over again, the film could have ended with that. They didn't have to find out it happened before.But I'm knitpicking. This is an amazing movie. It's too bad it was released so early in the year, because I think that may hurt Carrey as far as Oscar nominations. I'm not going to say he should win the award here (maybe...but lets see what other films come out this year), but he should definitely be considered for a nomination. We're witnessing an amazing transformation from goofball comedian to bona fide actor, something we saw faint glimpses of in \"The Truman Show\" and \"Man on the Moon\"\n",
      "1867\n",
      "There is only one reason I vowed to see this movie immediately after release, and that is Michel Gondry. I'm sure I'm not ringing any bells with this name, but I can mention a hell of a lot of music videos this man has done, and you will have seen at least one. He's the genius behind the White Stripe's \"Fell in Love With a Girl\" video with the animated LEGOs. He also directed six of Bjork's videos (including \"Human Behavior\") and popular songs like the Foo Fighters's \"Everlong.\" If there is anything one could say about his style is that he is a surrealist and a projector of dreams. This is why he is the perfect director for this script.The film is about Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) running through his memories of his ex-girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet) as they are disappearing forever. He has hired a doctor to erase every related memory connecting him to his troubled relationship, but finds out in the process that he might just have made a mistake.This is possibly the best role Jim Carrey's played. As you're dragged through loads of memories, Carrey is an incredible, soft-spoken but amicable guide and doesn't make one fault in his performance.  Kate Winslet, who is supposed to be the evil antagonist, does a fine job of convincing you that she is not what she is made out to be. The rest of the supporting cast (included in a related and moral-pounding side-story) provide a break in the action, their own morose tale relating to that of Joel's. The script has many great lines and writer Charlie Kaufman has written a story which pulls at the heartstrings so hard, they nearly snap... and this is all without making the movie [overly] \"sappy.\"This movie works wonders with this combination alone, but Michel Gondry's visuals are what keep you watching. Just like in his music videos he plays with the audience's heads, testing their believability and working the blink-factor very carefully. As Joel's mind is being played with, you see just how these tamperings affect his thoughts. memories flow together, the editing is done incredibly well for its twisted approach. This movie is not ordinary at all from the get-go, and Gondry leaves no opportunity untouched. See this movie, if anything, just to let it mess with your head.Visuals grounded me to my seat, performances forced my jaw open, and the story ripped out my heart and shoved it back in. I can't wait to stop typing and see it again. I sound like \"just a Michel Gondry fanboy\", and I won't deny that I am, but I know when something remarkable has come my way. See this movie. Form your own opinions. Mine come with a smile and a tear. 10/10\n",
      "1868\n",
      "If anyone still doubts that Jim Carrey can be a serious dramatic actor, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" will erase (pun not intended) all doubts.Carrey plays Joel, a depressed, anxious, phobic man who can't catch a break. In the opening scene, he spontaneously decides to blow off work and take a train out to Montauk. There he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), a free spirit and alcoholic, and they hit it off immediately. (Who says opposites don't attract?)In the next scene, Joel is crying his eyes out because Clementine not only left him for another man, but she has absolutely no recollection of him. So Joel decides to go to a doctor (Tom Wilkinson) to get his Clem erased from his memory.From this point, the story of Clem and Joel's relationship is told backward, sort of like \"Memento.\" The imagery in the flashback scenes is nothing short of wonderful. Director Michael Gondry uses a spotlight to point to what part of Joel's memory is being erased, while Joel and Clem try to stay away from the light so the Erasers can't find her.Speaking of the Erasers, Mark Ruffalo are Elijah Wood hysterical as Stan and Patrick, the techies who spend the night erasing Joel's memory. Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary, the doctor's receptionist and Stan's stoner girlfriend.But the best part of \"Eternal Sunshine\" is Jim Carrey. He leaves his goofiness behind (well, most of it anyway) to do another terrific dramatic performance. Joel is the most emotional character in the movie, whereas Clem is the wild, zany sexpot.I didn't see \"Being John Malkovich\" or \"Adaptation,\" so I can't compare \"Eternal Sunshine\" to Charles Kaufman's other movies. But I enjoyed it. It is an artistic, smart, sexy, and touching romantic dramedy about fighting fate to find happiness. (9/10)\n",
      "1869\n",
      "Greetings again from the darkness.  Writer Charlie Kaufman has a frightening brain and loves to share it.  While not at the level of \"Being John Malkovich\" or \"Adaptation\", this Kaufman script takes the film-goer on a ride to prove that's what it's all about.  The only thing that life in general and relationships specifically, offer are the memories and experiences.  Results matter little.  Jim Carrey bashers will surely crucify his dramatic turn, but most will see the depth he brings to the role.  He can act ... it is just difficult for many to get past the Carrey icon. Kirsten Dunst again proves she is so much more than a pretty face.  She leaps off the screen with pain and joy and eagerness.  Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson provide steady supporting roles, but the biggest disappointment is Kate Winslet.  Think knock-off of Madonna in \"Desperately Seeking Susan\". She does not have the edge necessary to pull off this role.  Her scenes come up empty when it is necessary for her to step up.  Many will liken the film to \"Total Recall\", but thanks to the writing, it will take you much deeper in your feelings than Arnold ever has!  So enjoy the story (even if it a bit far-fetched) and the wonderful visuals and be thankful there are filmmakers willing to take risks.\n",

      "This was one of my most anticipated movies this year and before entering the screening, I was crossing both fingers for it to be really good. Well, to say the least, it was really, *really* good. From the direction, to the acting, to the script, there wasn't anything that I could find that I really didn't like. Gondry is quite the creative director. The film felt really trippy, which, I think, added to the surreal experience of what it's like to be in someone's minds and having their memories erased. There is a particular scene in a bookstore with Joel and Clementine which is just so heartbreaking and the effects work excellently there. Kaufman's script is stronger than his previous ones. Take the creativeness of Being John Malkovich and the gravitas of Adaptation and double it and you've got Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.The performances are top-notch. Jim Carrey, who was alright in his dramatic roles before, truly shines her. I'm expecting an Academy nod for him. He brings a subtlety to the role that makes Joel sympathetic enough for the audience to realize the horror of what he is going through. Kate Winslet, who has always been one of the best actresses working today, blew me out of the water. Clementine comes off as a dislikable character at first but the way Kate plays her makes her very human and real and we don't doubt once as to exactly why Joel loves her the way he does. Out of the excellent supporting performances of Dunst, Wood, Wilkinson and Ruffalo, Elijah Wood stands out as the deceitful Patrick, played by Wood with an edge of remorse. I ended up sympathizing with this character even though I should really hate him. He really shows that he can play characters that are un-Frodo like and I was impressed with his range.All in all, I don't really know how this will be received commercially, but it deserves to dominate the box office. I don't know if I'll see a better film this year.\n",
      "1871\n",
      "I've honestly been having trouble figuring out how to start off this review.  I don't want to jump the gun by talking about everything that was so moving and amazing about it, and I don't want to chatter on too long without getting to the good parts.  So I guess I'll just leave the intro at that; it was absolutely beautiful.  I'm a huge movie fanatic, and I've been so upset with the outcome of so many movies in recent years, but I walked out of Eternal Sunshine in awe.I'm not gonna give a breakdown of the story because it's really something that should be experienced rather than spelled out.  While I always thought the trailers for this movie should have gone into a little bit more detail about the story, I realized while watching it that they gave you just the right amount of information: two people who were once a couple have their memories of each other erased, and everything goes buck wild.  I was kind of nervous that the story wouldn't explore that though-provoking idea enough simply because there's so many ways to take it.  But not only do they explore the idea to its fullest extent, but they tell it with a sense of style and complexity unlike any film you've ever seen.  After the movie, my friend and I could hardly contain our conversation about it, and she brought up a good point.  The film is told in such an abstract and complex manner, yet it's told with such clarity that everything makes perfect sense.The only aspect of the film that I think they should have flaunted more in the trailers is the sense of romantic fantasy in the film.   It is probably the most innovative and wonderful love story I've ever seen.  And considering what a huge fan I am of Amelie, that is saying a lot.  Eternal Sunshine explores aspects of romance that are atypical of most love stories, and with the subjective storytelling style and intriguing concept of the film, those aspects are shown in a way unlike any other film.I should also mention what a kick-ass guy Michel Gondry is.  He directed the hell out of this movie, Eternal Sunshine was just what I hoped to see from the person I consider to be one of the most talented filmmakers out there.  Considering the complexity and intrigue of his music videos and commercials, I expected that he would be able to knock the pants off the audience in a feature-length film if he was really allowed to do his thing. What was disappointing for me about Human Nature was that it wasn't nearly as conceptually advanced as many of his music videos are.  Eternal Sunshine, on the other hand, felt much more like his level and style of directing. This is some damn good news because with this amazing movie under his belt, he'll have the opportunity to do even more sophisticated films, and maybe do for the movie industry what he did for the music video industry.For me, the most exciting part of the movie was the fact that ever since I left the theater, I've wanted to see it again because there are so many details that I can pay more attention to the second time around. While the story was surprisingly straight forward and easy to follow, there were layers of it that seem purposefully withheld from first-time viewers.  I have the distinct feeling that there will be so much more for me to discover the second time around that I'll appreciate it even more; the telltale sign of a truly great movie.Overall, the movie is an experience.  I'm so glad to see something as inspired and thoughtful as this being released for everyone to see, I only hope the general audience gives it the chance it deserves.\n",
      "1872\n",
      "Unlike several individuals who I saw this with, I liked this film.  The performances were good.  Carrey shows that he has more dramatic range than his over-the-top comedic style suggests.  The directing is sure-handed, more importantly, he keeps you off balance, which is something that the story necessitates.  The most admirable feature though is the script.  Charlie Kaufman once again shows that his originality knows no bounds.  It's kind of funny, I don't love his movies; none would I consider \"favorites\".  He is one of my favorite screenwriters though.  I liked both Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, but I wasn't blown away by either film.  I was however blown away by the scripts.  The same holds true for this movie.  Kaufman has a natural gift for turning the lives of seemingly dull individuals into a spectrum of oddity.  His brilliantly \"out there\" plot lines aren't comparable to any other artist.  He's somewhat Felliniesque, but more surrealistic and less linear.  The bottom line is that this is a very good movie.  It is bizarre and fun, if somewhat esoteric.  What makes it especially engaging is the virtuosity with which random ideas are made into a cohesive acid-trip of a story.\n",
      "1873\n",
      "Thanks to TALK CINEMA, which is an excellent program of advance film showings around the USA, I had the opportunity to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and to marvel at another wacky but enjoyable Charlie Kaufman creation. Also taking credit for the story is the young French filmmaker, Michel Gondry, who also directs.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet put together excellent performances, as well as a solid support crew of zany actors:  Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood (a surprising role), and Tom Wilkinson.What we have is a combination of romance, comedy, and science fiction blended most of time in a smooth mix. There are a few slow, dull moments in the film, but these are bearable. On the whole, it's a great film with terrific effects as we move in and out of the hero's past.\n",
      "I am not sure what the film means...a spotless (pure?) mind yields a joyful existence?After both characters have some of their romantic memories removed, Jim Carrey's character fights to hide from a complete removal of his memories--which provides the core of the story--and finally succeeds in bridging all the problems of the past by starting over in his romantic relationship with Kate Winslet.But, whatever the film means, it's mostly a lot of fun and very entertaining.\n",
      "1874\n",
      "I got into a screening late last night of this movie, and was pure and simple blown away by what I saw. It's unbelieveable.After a brief prologue, it simply throws you into the movie headfirst. It took me about twenty minutes to get my bearings, to realize what was going on, but the execution of the core idea behind the movie (what if we could erase the memory of someone who hurt us?), is probably the most original storytelling method I've seen in a long while. The movie smashes everything you think you know to expect, everything you know about filmmaking, and just takes you for a ride through one man's consciousness, and his love for a woman. Only Kaufman and Gondry know where you're going, and as the movie works backwards through Carrey's memories it also works forwards through the process of his memory being erased. I simply can't describe how complex some of the scenes become, but through a brilliant series of camera tricks, phenomenal writing, and truly amazing acting, we're taken through a story that unfolds both in the real world and in Carrey's mind. I don't want to ruin anything of the plot points, not because there are big revelations or secrets, but because the whole point of the movie is to gain complete understanding of two people who very soon aren't going to even remember that they ever knew one another, and who do not realize just how much they love each other.I will not see a better movie this year.\n",
      "1875\n",
      "The thought of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in the same movie almost put me off before I entered the theatre, but the prospect of a Charlie Kaufman film was too strong to resist.In fact, both of the leads were gratifyingly good and not at all annoying, Carrey especially. (Note to Jim: do more drama and less of the comedy gurning, like Bruce Almighty!)The basic premise of the film is that Jim and Kate's characters are together, then split up and she decides to erase all memory of him. He discovers this and then decides to go down the same route. That's where the fun starts.In contrast to Adaptation and Being John Malkovich, this has a lot more romance in it and I imagine that many will shed a tear at the film. Having left the cinema almost 48 hours ago, though, I'm still trying to decide whether I like this movie or not. It made me laugh at times, it definitely made me think about whether there's any real point in erasing memories of someone, but I feel that Mr Kaufman may have bitten off more than he can chew this time. The trademark wackiness is still there, coupled with some temporal distortion, but overall I get the feeling that Kaufman's trying too hard. Undoubtedly, it'll do good box office and get good reviews, but it's no Being John Malkovich, or even an Adaption - sorry. 6 out of 10\n"
